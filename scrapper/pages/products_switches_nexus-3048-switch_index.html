1GE Top-of-Rack Integrated Layer 2/3 Switch
The Cisco Nexus 3048 Switch, part of the Unified Fabric family, is a 1 Gigabit Ethernet, top-of-rack (ToR) switch in a compact 1-rack-unit (1RU) form factor. It delivers wire-rate Layer 2 and Layer 3 switching on a data center-class Cisco NX-OS operating system. It is ideal for Big Data environments.
This switch provides local switching that connects transparently to upstream Cisco Nexus switches, creating an end-to-end Cisco Nexus fabric in data centers.
