Introduction
This document describes the IP device tracking feature, the triggers to add and remove a host, and the impact of device tracking on the 802.1x DACL.
Device Tracking Theory
This document describes how the IP device tracking feature works, which includes what the triggers are to add and remove a host.
Also, the impact of device tracking on the 802.1x Downloadable Access Control List (DACL) is explained.
The behavior changes between versions and platforms.
The second part of the document focuses on the Access Control List (ACL) returned by the Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server and applied to the 802.1x session.
A comparison between the DACL, Per-User ACL and Filter-ID ACL is presented.
Also, some caveats in regards to the ACL rewrite and default ACL are discussed.
Device tracking adds an entry when:
it learns the new entry via DHCP snooping.
it learns the new entry via an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) request (reads the sender MAC address and the sender IP address from the ARP packet).
That functionality is sometimes called ARP inspection, but it is not the same as Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI).
That feature is enabled by default and cannot be disabled. It is also called ARP snooping, but debugs do not show it after "debug arp snooping" is enabled.
ARP snooping is enabled by default and cannot be disabled or controlled.
Device tracking removes an entry when there is no response for an ARP request (sending probe for each host in the device tracking table, by default every 30 seconds).

After the DHCP binding is added to the database, it triggers the notification for device tracking:
02:31:12: sw_host_track-ev:host_track_notification: Add event for host 0050.5699.4ea1,

02:42:42: sw_host_track-ev:0050.5699.4ea1 Stopping cache timer
After the entry is removed from the device tracking table, the corresponding DHCP binding entry is still there:

IP Device Tracking = Enabled
--------------------------------------------------------------
  IP Address     MAC Address       Interface          STATE

192.168.0.241    0100.5056.994e.a1       Mar 02 1993 03:06 AM    Automatic
There is the issue when you have an ARP response, but the device tracking entry is removed anyway.
That bug appears to be in Version 12.2.33 and has not appeared in Version 12.2.55 or 15.x software.
Also there are some differences when handling with the L2 port (access-port) and L3 port (no switchport).

IP Device Tracking for Version 12.2.55 - Hidden Command
For Version 12.2 there, use a hidden command in order to activate it:

IP Device Tracking for Version 12.2.55 - Static IP Example
In this example, the PC has been configured with a static IP address. Debugs show that after you get an ARP response (MSG=2), the device tracking entry is updated.
01:03:16: sw_host_track-ev:0050.5699.4ea1 Stopping cache timer
01:03:16: sw_host_track-ev:0050.5699.4ea1: Send Host probe (0)
01:03:16: sw_host_track-ev:0050.5699.4ea1 Starting cache timer: 30 seconds
01:03:16: sw_host_track-ev:host_track_notification: Add event for host 0050.5699.4ea1,
 192.168.0.241 on interface FastEthernet0/1, vlan 1
01:03:16: sw_host_track-ev:Async Add event for host 0050.5699.4ea1, 192.168.0.241
 on interface FastEthernet0/1
01:03:16: sw_host_track-ev:MSG = 2
01:03:16: sw_host_track-ev:Add event: 0050.5699.4ea1, 192.168.0.241, FastEthernet0/1
01:03:16: sw_host_track-ev:0050.5699.4ea1: Cache entry refreshed
01:03:16: sw_host_track-ev:Activating host 0050.5699.4ea1, 192.168.0.241 on
 interface FastEthernet0/1
01:03:16: sw_host_track-ev:0050.5699.4ea1 Starting cache timer: 30 seconds
So every ARP request from the PC updates the device tracking table (the sender MAC address and sender IP address from the ARP packet).
IP Device Tracking for Version 15.x
It is important to remember that some of the features such as DACL for 802.1x are not supported in the LAN Lite version (beware - Cisco Feature Navigator does not always show the correct information).
The hidden command from Version 12.2 can be executed, but has no effect. In the Software Version 15.x, IP device tracking (IPDT) by default is only enabled for the interfaces which have 802.1x enabled:
bsns-3750-5#show ip device tracking all
IP Device Tracking = Enabled
IP Device Tracking Probe Count = 3
IP Device Tracking Probe Interval = 30
IP Device Tracking Probe Delay Interval = 0

After removal of 802.1x configuration from the port, IPDT is also removed from that port.
The port status is possibly be "DOWN", so it is necessary to have "switchport mode access" and "authenticaion port-control auto" in order to have IP device tracking activated on that port.
The maximum interface device limit is set to 10:
bsns-3750-5(config-if)#ip device tracking maximum ?
  <1-10>  Maximum devices
IP Device Tracking for Cisco IOS-XEÂ®
Again, the behavior on Cisco IOS-XE 3.3 has changed when compared to Cisco IOS Version 15.x.
The hidden command from Version 12.2 is obsolete, but now this error is returned:
3850-1#  no ip device tracking int g1/0/48
% Command accepted but obsolete, unreleased or unsupported; see documentation.
In Cisco IOS-XE, device tracking is activated for all the interfaces (even the ones which do not have 802.1x configured):
3850-1#show ip device tracking all

Global IP Device Tracking Probe Count = 3

IP Device Tracking with 802.1x and DACL for Version 12.2.55
If 802.1x is configured with DACL, the device tracking entry is used in order to fill the IP address of device.
This example shows device tracking working for a statically configured IP:
BSNS-3560-1#show ip device tracking all
IP Device Tracking = Enabled
IP Device Tracking Probe Count = 2
IP Device Tracking Probe Interval = 30
IP Device Tracking Probe Delay Interval = 0

This shows an applied ACL:
 BSNS-3560-1#show ip access-lists                                          
Extended IP access list Auth-Default-ACL
    10 permit udp any range bootps 65347 any range bootpc 65348
    20 permit udp any any range bootps 65347
    30 deny ip any any (8 matches)
Extended IP access list xACSACLx-IP-DACL-516c2694 (per-user)
    10 permit icmp any any (6 matches)
Also, the ACL on the fa0/1 interface is the same:
BSNS-3560-1#show ip access-lists interface fa0/1
     permit icmp any any
Even though the default is dot1x ACL:
BSNS-3560-1#show ip interface fa0/1
FastEthernet0/1 is up, line protocol is up
  Inbound  access list is Auth-Default-ACL
It is expected for the ACL to use "any" as 192.168.0.244. That works like this for auth proxy, but for 802.1x DACL src "any" is not changed to the detected IP of the PC.
For auth proxy, one original ACL from the ACS is cached and shown with the show ip access-list command and a specific (Per-User with specific IP) ACL is applied on the interface with the show ip access-list interface fa0/1 command. However, auth-proxy does not use device IP tracking.
What if the IP address is not detected correctly? After device tracking is disabled:
BSNS-3560-1#show authentication sessions interface fa0/1
            Interface:  FastEthernet0/1
          MAC Address:  0050.5699.4ea1

      Security Status:  Unsecure
       Oper host mode:  single-host
     Oper control dir:  both
        Authorized By:  Authentication Server
          Vlan Policy:  2
              ACS ACL:  xACSACLx-IP-DACL-516c2694
      Session timeout:  N/A
         Idle timeout:  N/A
    Common Session ID:  0A3042A9000000000000C775

               Handle:  0xB0000000

Runnable methods list:
       Method   State
       dot1x    Authc Success
So no IP address is attached then, but the DACL is still applied:
BSNS-3560-1#show ip access-lists 
Extended IP access list Auth-Default-ACL
    10 permit udp any range bootps 65347 any range bootpc 65348
    20 permit udp any any range bootps 65347
    30 deny ip any any (4 matches)
Extended IP access list xACSACLx-IP-DACL-516c2694 (per-user)
    10 permit icmp any any
In this scenario, device tracking for 802.1x is not required. The only difference is that knowing the IP address of the client upfront can be used for a RADIUS access-request. After attribute 8 is attached:
radius-server attribute 8 include-in-access-req
It exists in Access-Request and on ACS it is possible to create more granular authorization rules:
00:17:44: RADIUS(00000001): Send Access-Request to 10.48.66.185:1645 id 1645/27, len 257
00:17:44: RADIUS:  authenticator F8 17 06 CE C1 85 E8 E8 - CB 5B 57 96 6C 07 CE CA

00:17:44: RADIUS:  Framed-IP-Address   [8]   6   192.168.0.244 
Keep in mind that TrustSec also needs IP device tracking for IP to SGT bindings.
IP Device Tracking with 802.1x and DACL for Version 15.x
What is the difference between Version 15.x and Version 12.2.55 in DACL? In software Version15.x, it works the same as for auth-proxy.
The generic ACL can be seen when the show ip access-list command is entered (cached response from AAA), but after the show ip access-list interface fa0/1 command, the src "any" is replaced by the source IP address of the host (known via IP device tracking).
This is the example for a phone and PC on one port (g1/0/1), software Version 15.0.2SE2 on 3750X:
bsns-3750-5#sh authentication sessions interface g1/0/1
            Interface:  GigabitEthernet1/0/1

The phone is authenticated via MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB), while the PC uses dot1x. Both the phone and PC use the same ACL:
bsns-3750-5#show ip access-lists xACSACLx-IP-PERMIT_ALL_TRAFFIC-51134bb2
Extended IP access list xACSACLx-IP-PERMIT_ALL_TRAFFIC-51134bb2 (per-user)
    10 permit ip any any
However, when verified on the interface level the source has been replaced by the IP address of the device.
IP device tracking triggers that change and it can occur at any time (much later than the authentication session and download of the ACL):
bsns-3750-5#show ip access-lists interface g1/0/1        
     permit ip host 192.168.2.200 any (5 matches)
     permit ip host 192.168.10.12 any
Both MAC addresses are marked as static:
bsns-3750-5#sh mac address-table interface g1/0/1
          Mac Address Table
-------------------------------------------

 100    0007.5032.6941    STATIC      Gi1/0/1 
Specific ACL Entry
When is the source "any" in the DACL replaced with the host IP address? Only when there are at least two sessions on the same port (two supplicants).
There is no need to replace the source "any" when there is only one session.
The problems appear when there are multiple sessions, and for not all of them IP device tracking knows the IP address of the host. In that scenario it is still "any" for some entries.
That behavior is different on some platforms. For example, on the 2960X with Version 15.0(2)EX the ACL is always specific even when there is just one authentication session per port.
However, for the 3560X and 3750X Version 15.0(2)SE, you need to have at least two sessions to make that ACL specific.
Control-Direction
By default, the control-direction is type both:
bsns-3750-5(config)#int g1/0/1
bsns-3750-5(config-if)#authentication control-direction ?
  both  Control traffic in BOTH directions
  in    Control inbound traffic only

bsns-3750-5(config-if)#authentication control-direction both 
That means that before the supplicant is authenticated, traffic cannot be sent to or from the port. For "in" mode, the traffic could have been sent from port to supplicant, but not from supplicant to the port (could be useful  for the WAKE on LAN feature).
Still, the switch applies the ACL just on the "in" direction. It does not matter which mode is used.
bsns-3750-5#sh ip access-lists interface g1/0/1 out      
bsns-3750-5#sh ip access-lists interface g1/0/1 in 
     permit ip host 192.168.2.200 any
     permit ip host 192.168.10.12 any
That basically means that after authentication the ACL is applied for traffic to the port (in direction) and all traffic is permitted from the port (out direction).
IP Device Tracking with 802.1x and Per-User ACL for Version 15.x
It is also possible to use a Per-User ACL which is passed in cisco-av-pair "ip:inacl" and "ip:outacl".
This example configuration is similar to a previous configuration, but this time the phone uses DACL and the PC uses Per-User ACL. The ISE profile for the PC is:
The phone still has the DACL applied:
bsns-3750-5#show authentication sessions interface g1/0/1
            Interface:  GigabitEthernet1/0/1
          MAC Address:  0007.5032.6941

    10 permit ip any any
However, the PC on the same port uses the Per-User ACL:
    Interface:  GigabitEthernet1/0/1
          MAC Address:  0050.5699.4ea1
           IP Address:  192.168.2.200

      Acct Session ID:  0x000006D1
               Handle:  0x9D000568
In order to verify how that is merged on the gig1/0/1 port:
bsns-3750-5#show ip access-lists interface g1/0/1
     permit icmp host 192.168.2.200 any log
     permit ip host 192.168.10.12 any
The first entry has been taken from the Per-User ACL (notice the log keyword) and the second entry is taken from the DACL.
Both of them are rewritten by IP device tracking for the specific IP address.
Per-User ACL could be verified with the debug epm all command:
Apr 12 02:30:13.489: EPM_SESS_EVENT:IP Per-User ACE: permit icmp any any log received

And also via the show ip access-lists command:
bsns-3750-5#show ip access-lists
Extended IP access list GigabitEthernet1/0/1#IP#7844C6C (per-user)
    10 permit icmp any any log
What about the ip:outacl attribute? It is completely omitted in Version 15.x. The attribute has been received, but the switch does not apply/process that attribute.
Difference when Compared to the DACL
As noted in Cisco bug ID CSCut25702, the Per-User ACL behaves differently than DACL.
DACL with just one entry ("permit ip any any") and one supplicant connected to a port can work correctly without IP device tracking enabled.
The "any" argument is not substituted and all traffic is permitted. However, for the Per-User ACL it is mandatory to have IP device tracking enabled.
If it is disabled and has just the "permit ip any any" entry and one supplicant, then all traffic is blocked.
IP Device Tracking with 802.1x and Filter-ID ACL for Version 15.x
Also, the IETF attribute filter-id [11] can be used. The AAA server returns the ACL name, which is defined locally on the switch. The ISE profile could look like this:
Note that you need to specifiy the direction (in or out). For that it is necessary to add the attribute manually:
Then the debug shows:
debug epm all

Apr 12 23:41:05.170: EPM_SESS_EVENT:Filter-Id : Filter-ACL received
Apr 12 23:41:05.170: EPM_SESS_EVENT:Notifying PD regarding Policy (NAMED ACL)

That ACL is also shown for the authenticated session:
bsns-3750-5#show authentication sessions interface g1/0/1

            Interface:  GigabitEthernet1/0/1
          MAC Address:  0050.5699.4ea1

Runnable methods list:
       Method   State
       dot1x    Authc Success
       mab      Not run
And, as the ACL is binded to the interface:
bsns-3750-5#show ip access-lists interface g1/0/1
     permit icmp host 192.168.2.200 any log
     permit tcp host 192.168.2.200 any log
Note that this ACL can be merged with other types of ACLs on the same interface. For example, having on the same switch port another supplicant which gets DACL from ISE:  "permit ip any any"  you could see:
bsns-3750-5#show ip access-lists interface g1/0/1
     permit icmp host 192.168.2.200 any log
     permit tcp host 192.168.2.200 any log
     permit ip host 192.168.10.12 any
Note that the IP device tracking rewrites the source IP for each source (supplicant).
What about the "out" filter list? Again (as Per-User ACL), it is not used by the switch.
IP Device Tracking - Defaults and Best Practices
For releases earlier than 15.2(1)E, before any feature can use IPDT it needs to be enabled globally first with this CLI command:
(config)#ip device tracking
For releases 15.2(1)E and later, the ip device tracking command is not needed any more. IPDT is enabled only if a feature that relies on it enables it.
If no feature enables IPDT, IPDT is disabled. The "no ip device tracking" command has no effect. The specific feature has the control to enable/disable IPDT.
When you enable IPDT, you have to remember about the "Duplicate IP Address" issue on . See Troubleshoot "Duplicate IP Address 0.0.0.0" Error Messages for more information.
It is recommended to disable IPDT on a trunk port:
(config-if)# no ip device tracking
On the later Cisco IOS, it is a different command:
(config-if)# ip device tracking maximum 0
It is recommended to enable IPDT on the access port and delay ARP probes in order to avoid the "Duplicate IP Address" issue:
(config-if)# ip device tracking probe delay 10
Interface ACL Rewrite for Version 15.x
For the interface ACL, it works before authentication:
interface GigabitEthernet1/0/2
 description windows7
 switchport mode access
 ip access-group test1 in
 authentication order mab dot1x
 authentication port-control auto
 mab
 dot1x pae authenticator
end

bsns-3750-5#show ip access-lists test1
Extended IP access list test1
    10 permit tcp any any log-input
However, after authentication succeeds it is rewritten (override) by the ACL returned from the AAA server (it does not matter if it is DACL, ip:inacl, or filterid).
That ACL (test1) can block the traffic (which would normally be permitted on open mode), but after authentication, does not matter anymore.
Even when no ACL is returned from the AAA server, the interface ACL is overwritten and full access is provided.
That is a bit misleading since Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) indicates that the ACL is still binded on the interface level.
Here is an example from Version 15.2.2 on 3750X:
bsns-3750-6#show platform acl portlabels interface g1/0/2

    MAC Access Group: (none), 0 VMRs
That information is valid only for the interface level, not for the session level. Some more information (presents a compounded ACL) can be deduced from:
bsns-3750-6#show ip access-lists interface g1/0/2
     permit ip host 192.168.1.203 any
Extended IP access list test1
    10 permit icmp host x.x.x.x host n.n.n.n
The first entry is created as "permit ip any any" DACL is returned for successful authentication (and "any" is replaced by an entry from the device tracking table).
The second entry is the result of the interface ACL and is applied for all new authentications (before authorization).
Unfortunately, (again platform dependent) both ACLs are concatenated. That happens on Version 15.2.2 on 3750X.
That means that for authorized session, both of them are applied. First the DACL and second the interface ACL.
That is why when you add explicit "deny ip any any", the DACL does not take into consideration the interface ACL.
Usually there is no explicit deny in the DACL and then the interface ACL is applied after that.
The behavior for Version 15.0.2 on 3750X is the same, but the sh ip access-list interface command does not show the interface ACL anymore (but it is still concatenated with the interface ACL unless explicit deny in the DACL exists).
Default ACL Used for 802.1x
There are two types of default ACLs:
auth-default-ACL-OPEN - used for open mode
auth-default-ACL - used for closed access
Both auth-default-ACL and auth-default-ACL-OPEN are used when the port is in the unauthorized state. By default, closed access is used.
That means that before authentication all traffic is dropped except the one permitted by the auth-default-ACL.
This way DHCP traffic is permitted before successful authorization.
The IP address is allocated and the downloaded DACL can be correctly applied.
That ACL is created automatically and cannot be found in the configuration.
bsns-3750-5#sh run | i Auth-Default

bsns-3750-5#sh ip access-lists Auth-Default-ACL
Extended IP access list Auth-Default-ACL
    10 permit udp any range bootps 65347 any range bootpc 65348 (22 matches)
    20 permit udp any any range bootps 65347 (12 matches)
    30 deny ip any any
It is created dynamically for the first authentication (between authentication and authorization phase) and removed after the last session is removed.
Auth-Default-ACL permits only DHCP traffic. After authentication succeeds and the new DACL is downloaded, it is applied to that session.
When the mode is changed to open auth-default-ACL-OPEN appears and it is used and works in exactly the same way as Auth-Default-ACL:
bsns-3750-5(config)#int g1/0/2
bsns-3750-5(config-if)#authentication open

bsns-3750-5#show ip access-lists 
Extended IP access list Auth-Default-ACL-OPEN
    10 permit ip any any
Both ACLs can be customized, but they are never seen in the configuration.
bsns-3750-5(config)#ip access-list extended Auth-Default-ACL
bsns-3750-5(config-ext-nacl)#permit udp any any

bsns-3750-5#sh ip access-lists 
Extended IP access list Auth-Default-ACL
    10 permit udp any range bootps 65347 any range bootpc 65348 (22 matches)
    20 permit udp any any range bootps 65347 (16 matches)
    30 deny ip any any
    40 permit udp any any

bsns-3750-5#sh run | i Auth-Def
bsns-3750-5#
Open Mode
The previous section described the behavior for ACLs (which includes the one used by default for open mode). The behavior for open mode is:
it allows for all traffic (as per default auth-default-ACL-OPEN) when the session is in an unauthorized state.
the session is in an unauthorized state during authentication/authorization (good for Encryption Appliance Model E (PXE) boot scenarios) or after that process fails (good for scenarios called "low impact mode").
when the session moves to the authorized state for multiple platforms, ACLs are concatenated and the first DACL is used, then the interface ACL.
for multi-auth or multi-domain there are possibly multiple sessions at the same time in different states (then the different ACL type applies for each session).
When the Interface ACL is Mandatory
For multiple 6500/4500 platforms, the interface ACL is mandatory in order to apply the DACL correctly.
Here is an example with 4500 sup2 12.2.53SG6, no interface ACL:
brisk#show run int g2/3
!
interface GigabitEthernet2/3
 switchport mode access
 switchport voice vlan 10
 authentication host-mode multi-auth
 authentication open
 authentication order mab dot1x
 authentication priority dot1x mab
 authentication port-control auto
 mab
Then after the host is authenticated, the DACL is downloaded. It is not applied and authorization fails.

The authentication and authorization succeeds and the DACL is applied correctly:
brisk#show authentication sessions

Gi2/3      0007.5032.6941  mab      VOICE    Authz Success  0A30434500000008001A2CE4
The behavior is not dependent on "authentication open". In order to accept the DACL, you need the interface ACL for both open/closed mode.
DACL on 4500/6500
On the 4500/6500, the DACL is applied with acl_snoop DACLs. An example with 4500 sup2 12.2.53SG6 (phone + PC) is shown here. There is a separate ACL for voice (10) and data (100) VLAN:
brisk#show ip access-lists 
Extended IP access list acl_snoop_Gi2/3_10
    10 permit ip host 192.168.2.200 any
    20 deny ip any any
Extended IP access list acl_snoop_Gi2/3_100
    10 permit ip host 192.168.10.12 any
    20 deny ip any any
ACLs are specific because IPDT has the correct entries:
brisk#show ip device tracking all
IP Device Tracking = Enabled
IP Device Tracking Probe Count = 3
IP Device Tracking Probe Interval = 30
IP Device Tracking Probe Delay Interval = 0
---------------------------------------------------------------------
  IP Address     MAC Address   Vlan  Interface              STATE

192.168.2.200   000c.29d7.0617  10   GigabitEthernet2/3     ACTIVE
Authenticated sessions confirm the addresses:
brisk#show authentication sessions int g2/3
            Interface:  GigabitEthernet2/3
          MAC Address:  000c.29d7.0617

Runnable methods list:

       mab      Authc Success
       dot1x    Not run
At this stage both the PC and the phone responds to ICMP echo, but the interface ACL presents only:
brisk#show ip access-lists interface g2/3    
     permit ip host 192.168.10.12 any
Why? Because the DACL has been pushed only for the phone (192.168.10.12). For the PC, the interface ACL with open mode is used:
interface GigabitEthernet2/3
 ip access-group all in
 authentication open

brisk#show ip access-lists all
Extended IP access list all
    10 permit ip any any (73 matches)
In summary, acl_snoop is created for both the PC and the phone, but the DACL is returned just for the phone. That is why that ACL is seen as binded to the interface.
MAC Address Status for 802.1x
When 802.1x authentication starts, the MAC address is still seen as DYNAMIC but action for that packet is DROP:
bsns-3750-5#show authentication sessions 

Interface  MAC Address     Method   Domain   Status         Session ID
Gi1/0/1    0007.5032.6941  dot1x    UNKNOWN  Running        C0A8000100000596479F4DCE

bsns-3750-5#show mac  address-table interface g1/0/1
          Mac Address Table

Vlan    Mac Address       Type        Ports
----    -----------       --------    -----
 100    0007.5032.6941    DYNAMIC     Drop
Total Mac Addresses for this criterion: 1
After successful authentication the MAC address becomes static and the port number is provided:
bsns-3750-5#show authentication sessions 

Interface  MAC Address     Method   Domain   Status         Session ID
Gi1/0/1    0007.5032.6941  mab      VOICE    Authz Success  C0A8000100000596479F4DCE

bsns-3750-5#show mac address-table interface g1/0/1
          Mac Address Table
-------------------------------------------

Vlan    Mac Address       Type        Ports
----    -----------       --------    -----
 100    0007.5032.6941    STATIC      Gi1/0/1 

That is true for all mab/dot1x session for both domains (VOICE/DATA).
Troubleshoot
Remember to read the 802.1x configuration guide for your specific software version and platform.
If you open a TAC case, provide the output from these commands:
show tech
show authentication session interface <xx> detail
show mac address-table interface <xx>
It is also good to collect a SPAN port packet capture and these debugs:
debug radius verbose
debug epm all
debug authentication all
debug dot1x all
debug authentication feature <yy> all
debug aaa authentication
debug aaa authorization
