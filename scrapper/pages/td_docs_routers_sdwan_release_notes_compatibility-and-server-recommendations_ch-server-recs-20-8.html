Chapter Contents
Single Tenant
The supported hardware specifications for the Cisco vBond Orchestrator, Cisco vManage, and the Cisco vSmart Controller are as follows:

Note
For cloud deployments, the Cisco operation teams actively monitor the customer deployment and add resource in collaboration with the customer. This topic does not include recommendations for Cisco cloud deployments.

Note
The controller and the device version should be the same, to achieve the below scale.

* vCPU, RAM, and Storage Size numbers are on per Cisco vManage basis. The Storage Size numbers are the maximum tested values by Cisco, you can allocate smaller storage sizes.
** For a larger dataset per day, have Stats running on all servers.
To achieve scale beyond the above mentioned numbers, deploy multiple overlays.

Note
In Cisco vManage Release 20.5.1 and earlier releases, You can modify the DPI size to the desired value to achieve the above mentioned storage size numbers.

Note
Starting from Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, you can achieve the above mentioned storage size numbers by modifying the aggregated DPI size. The aggregated DPI size is unidimensional and varies when the deployment includes edge devices that run on a mix of releases (Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.6.x and earlier releases). The aggregated DPI also varies when on-demand troubleshooting is enabled for the devices.
Ensure that both the DPI and aggregated DPI index sizes are configured to enable on-demand troubleshooting.
To modify the aggregated DPI value,
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Administration > Settings.
Click Edit next to Statistics Database Configuration.
Modify the Aggregated DPI size to the desired value based on your DPI traffic, the default disk size allocation is 5 GB.

Note
When DPI is enabled, you must set the Statistics Collection timer to 30 minutes or higher.
To set the Statistics Collection timer,
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Administration > Settings.
Click Edit next to Statistics Configuration.
Modify the Collection Interval minutes to the desired value based on your DPI traffic, the default collection interval is 30 minutes.
Click Save.

Note
If DPI is enabled, we recommend that the aggregated DPI data (across all Cisco vManage nodes and all tenants in the multitenant system) does not exceed 350 GB per day. If the DPI data exceeds 350 GB per day, increase the Hard Disk capacity of each Cisco vManage node up to 10 TB.
A pair of Cisco vSmart Controllers supports 24 tenants and 1000 devices across all tenants.
A tenant can add a maximum of 1000 devices.
The tested and recommended limit of supported Cisco vBond Orchestrator instances in a single Cisco SD-WAN overlay is eight.
