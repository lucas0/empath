Our strategy
Providing equitable opportunities in underserved communities
We invest in tech-enabled solutions that provide individuals with equitable opportunities and contribute to local community growth and economic development in a sustainable economy. We focus our support in three interconnected areas:
Skills development to help job seekers secure dignified employment and long-term career pathways in technology or other sectors, including environmental sustainability/green jobs.
Inclusive entrepreneurship with small businesses as engines of local growth, as well as high growth potential start-ups as large-scale job creators nationally and internationally, in technology or other sectors, including environment sustainability/green businesses.
Banking the unbanked through relevant and affordable financial products and capacity building services.
