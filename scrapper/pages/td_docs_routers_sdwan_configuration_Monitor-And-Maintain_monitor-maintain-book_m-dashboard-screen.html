Enhanced Cisco vManage User Interface for a Consolidated Monitoring View
Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1
This feature introduces the enhanced user interface of Cisco vManage. The Monitor window provides a single-page, real-time user interface that facilitates a consolidated view of all the monitoring components and services of a Cisco SD-WAN overlay network. It provides an entry point for all Cisco vManage dashboards, including Main Dashboard, VPN Dashboard, Security, and Multicloud. These dashboards were earlier accessible from the Dashboard menu. In addition, all the monitoring components have been organized into buttons in the user interface so that you can quickly navigate from one page to another.
The Tools menu of Cisco vManage has also been enhanced in this release. The Network Wide Path Insight and On Demand Troubleshooting options that were earlier accessible from the Monitor menu have now been moved to the Tools menu for you to easily locate these features.

A site is a specific physical location within the Cisco SD-WAN overlay network, such as a branch office, a data center, or a campus. Each site is identified by a unique integer,calleda site ID. Each device at a site is identified by the same site ID.
The Site BFD Connectivity pane displays the state of a site's data connections. When a site has multiple WAN Edge routers, this pane displays the state for the entire site, not for individual devices. The Site BFD Connectivity pane displays three states:
Full: Total number of sites where all BFD sessions on all WAN Edge routers are in the up state.
Partial: Total number of sites where a TLOC or a tunnel is in the down state. These sites still have limited data plane connectivity.
Unavailable: Total number of sites where all BFD sessions on all WAN Edge routers are in the down state. These sites have no data plane connectivity.

Note
The Site Count includes only sites with the installed devices that are up and running. Some sites are excluded from the Site Count if one of the installed devices in the site is down or if TLOC or tunnels are down (relevant for sites with two devices).
When you click Full, Partial, or the Unavailable status, a sidebar appears displaying detailed information of each site, node, or tunnel. For the desired device, click ... to access the Device Dashboard or Real Time view in the Monitor > Devices page or to access Tools > SSH Terminal.

View Firewall Enforcement Pane
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Monitor > Security. The Firewall Enforcement pane displays the number of sessions that were inspected or dropped over the specified time period.
Cisco’s Enterprise Firewall with Application Awareness uses a flexible and easily understood zone-based model for data traffic inspection. Zone-based firewalls allow inspection of TCP, UDP, and ICMP data traffic. A zone can contain a group of one or more VPNs. Grouping VPNs into zones allows users to establish security boundaries in the overlay network so that users can control all data traffic that passes between zones.
A firewall policy defines the conditions that the data traffic flow from the source zone must match to allow the flow to the destination zone. Firewall policies can match IP prefixes, IP ports, the protocols TCP, UDP, and ICMP, and applications. Matching flows for prefixes, ports, and protocols can be accepted or dropped, and the packet headers can be logged.
Click Inspected to see the number of inspected data sessions.
Click Dropped to see the number of dropped packets.
Click the Time drop-down list to select a time period for which to display data.
