Chapter: Deploy the Management Center Virtual Using Cisco Hyperflex
Chapter Contents
Cisco HyperFlex systems deliver hyperconvergence for any application, and anywhere. HyperFlex with Cisco Unified Computing System (Cisco UCS) technology that is managed through the Cisco Intersight cloud operations platform can power applications and data anywhere, optimize operations from a core datacenter to the edge and into public clouds, and therefore increase agility through accelerating DevOps practices.
You can deploy the management center virtual on Cisco Hyperflex.

Host System Requirements
Management Center Virtual Requires 28 GB RAM
We recommend you do not decrease the default settings: 32 GB RAM for most the management center virtual instances. To improve performance, you can always increase a virtual appliance’s memory and number of CPUs, depending on your available resources.
Memory and Resource Requirements
You can deploy the management center virtual using HyperFlex cluster provisioning hosted on HyperFlex ESX and ESXi hypervisors. See the Cisco Firepower Compatibility Guide for hypervisor compatibility.
For the management center virtual, check the latest Release Notes for details on whether a new release affects your environment. You may be required to increase resources to deploy the latest version.
The specific hardware used for the management center virtual deployments can vary, depending on the number of instances deployed and usage requirements. Each virtual appliance you create requires a minimum resource allocation—memory, number of CPUs, and disk space—on the host machine.
The following table lists the recommended and default settings for the management center virtual appliance.

Important
Be sure to allocate enough memory to ensure the optimal performance of your management center virtual. If your management center virtual has less than 32 GB memory, your system could experience policy deployment issues. Do not decrease the default settings, as they are the minimum required to run the system software.

Limitations and Guidelines for the Management Center Virtual on Cisco HyperFlex
Limitations
The following limitations exist when you deploy the management center virtual for Cisco HyperFlex:
The management center virtual appliances do not have serial numbers. The System > Configuration page shows either None or Not Specified depending on the virtual platform.
Cloning a virtual machine is not supported.
Restoring a virtual machine with snapshot is not supported.
VMware Workstation, Player, Server, and Fusion do not recognize OVF packaging and are not supported.
OVF File Guidelines
Virtual appliances use Open Virtual Format (OVF) packaging. You deploy a virtual appliance with a virtual infrastructure (VI) OVF template. The selection of the OVF file is based on the deployment target-
For deployment on vCenter—Cisco_Firepower_Management_Center_Virtual_VMware-VI-X.X.X-xxx.ovf
where X.X.X-xxx is the version and build number of the System software you want to deploy. The installation process allows you to perform the entire initial setup for the management center virtual appliance. You can specify:
A new password for the admin account.
Network settings that allow the appliance to communicate on your management network.
High Availability Support
You can establish high availability (HA) between two management center virtual appliances deployed on Hyperflex host:
The management center virtual HA is supported on both the management center virtual models: Management Center Virtual.
The two management center virtual appliances in a high availability configuration must be the same model.
To establish the management center virtual HA, management center virtual requires an extra management center virtual license entitlement for each the threat defense device that it manages in the HA configuration. However, the required threat defense feature license entitlement for each the threat defense device has no change regardless of the management center virtual HA configuration. See License Requirements for FTD Devices in a High Availability Pair in the Firepower Management Center Configuration Guide for guidelines about licensing.
If you break the management center virtual HA pair, the extra management center virtual license entitlement is released, and you need only one entitlement for each the threat defense device.
See Establishing Firepower Management Center High Availability in the Firepower Management Center Configuration Guide for guidelines about high availability.

Deploy the Management Center Virtual to Cisco Hyperflex on a vSphere vCenter Server
Use this procedure to deploy the management center virtual appliance to Cisco Hyperflex on a vSphere vCenter Server.
Before you begin
Ensure that you have deployed Cisco HyperFlex and performed all the post-installation configuration tasks. For more information, see Cisco HyperFlex Systems Documentation Roadmap.
You must have at least one network configured in vSphere (for management) before you deploy the management center virtual.
Download the management center virtual VI OVF template file from Cisco.com: Cisco_Firepower_Management_Center_Virtual-VI-X.X.X-xxx.ovf, where X.X.X-xxx is the version and build number.
Procedure
Step 1
Log in to the vSphere Web Client.
Step 2
Select the Hyperflex cluster where you want to deploy the management center virtual, and click ACTIONS > Deploy OVF Template.
Step 3
Browse your file system for the OVF template source location, and click NEXT
You want to select the management center virtual VI OVF template:
Cisco_Firepower_Management_Center_Virtual-VI-X.X.X-xxx.ovf
where X.X.X-xxx is the version and build number of the archive file you downloaded.
Step 4
Specify a name and folder for the management center virtual deployment, and click NEXT.
Step 5
Select a compute resource, and wait until the compatibility check is complete. If the compatibility check succeeds, click NEXT.
Step 6
Review the OVF template information (product name, vendor, version, download size, size on disk, and description), and click NEXT.
Step 7
Review and accept the license agreement that is packaged with the OVF template (VI templates only), and click NEXT.
Step 8
Select a storage location and virtual disk format, and click NEXT.
On this window, you select from datastores already configured on the destination HyperFlex cluster. The virtual machine configuration file and virtual disk files are stored on the datastore. Select a datastore large enough to accommodate the virtual machine and all of its virtual disk files.
When you select Thick Provisioned as the virtual disk format, all storage is immediately allocated. When you select Thin Provisioned as the virtual disk format, storage is allocated on demand as data is written to the virtual disks. Thin provisioning can also reduce the amount of time it takes to deploy the virtual appliance.
Step 9
Map the networks specified in the OVF template to networks in your inventory, and click NEXT.
Step 10
Set the user-configurable properties packaged with the OVF template:
Note
  You must mandatorily configure all the required customizations in this step.
Password
Set the password for the management center virtual admin access.
Network
Set the network information, including the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), DNS, and network protocol (IPv4 or IPv6).
Click NEXT.
Step 11
Review and verify the displayed information. To begin the deployment with these settings, click FINISH. To make any changes, click BACK to navigate back through the screens.
After you complete the wizard, the vSphere Web Client processes the virtual machine; you can see the “Initialize OVF deployment” status in the Global Information area Recent Tasks pane.
When it is finished, you see the Deploy OVF Template completion status.
The management center virtual instance appears under the specified data center in the Inventory. Booting up the new VM could take up to 30 minutes.
Note
  To successfully register the management center virtual with the Cisco Licensing Authority, the management center requires Internet access. You need to perform additional configuration after deployment to achieve Internet access and successful license registration. DNS server configuration is mandatory for license registration.
What to do next
Initialize the virtual appliance; see Power On and Initialize the Virtual Appliance
Power On and Initialize the Virtual Appliance
After you complete the deployment of the virtual appliance, initialization starts automatically when you power on the virtual appliance for the first time.

Caution
Startup time depends on a number of factors, including server resource availability. It can take up to 40 minutes for the initialization to complete. Do not interrupt the initialization or you may have to delete the appliance and start over.
Procedure
Step 1
Power on the appliance.
In the vSphere Client, right-click the name of your virtual appliance from the inventory list, then select Power > Power On from the context menu.
Step 2
Monitor the initialization on the VM console.
What to do next
After you deploy the management center virtual, you must complete a setup process to configure the new appliance to communicate on your trusted management network. If you deploy with a VI OVF template on Hyperflex, setting up the management center virtual is a two-step process.
To complete the initial setup of the management center virtual, see Management Center Virtual Initial Setup.
