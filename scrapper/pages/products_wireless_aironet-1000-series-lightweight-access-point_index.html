Information about product support
The Cisco Aironet 1000 Series Lightweight Access Point is an 802.11 a/b/g dual-band, zero- touch configuration and management access point that delivers secure, cost effective wireless access with advanced WLAN services for enterprise deployments. This lightweight access point provides industry-leading RF capabilities with a wide breadth of deployment options to maximize wireless LAN performance, security, reliability, and scalability. This device meets and exceeds the performance requirements of the most demanding enterprise environments.

The Cisco Aironet 1000 Series Lightweight Access Point works in conjunction with a Cisco Wireless LAN Controller and optional Cisco Wireless Control System (WCS) to support simultaneous data forwarding and air monitoring functions. This provides real-time RF management and intrusion protection functions in conjunction with traffic delivery. With this solution, the need for additional dedicated monitoring nodes is eliminated, thereby reducing the cost and complexity of WLAN deployment. This access point supports Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and 802.11i/WPA2 for enterprise-class interoperable WLAN security.

Models are available with internal antennas or connectors for external antennas to accommodate complex RF environments. A unique variant of the 1000 Series, the Cisco Aironet 1000 Series Remote Edge access point is designed to cost effectively extend intelligent WLAN services to remote offices.
