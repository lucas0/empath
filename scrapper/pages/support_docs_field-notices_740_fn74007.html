Defect Information

Defect ID Headline
CSCwe24011 4GFI Unexpected Reboot - fex hap reset

Problem Description

Cisco UCS 6400 Series and 6500 Series Fabric Interconnects that are running Cisco UCS Infrastructure and UCS Manager (UCSM Infrastructure) Software Bundle Release 4.2(2d) or Release 4.2(3b) may unexpectedly restart. When reviewing the reason for the reset, you will see Reset triggered due to HA policy of Reset, as seen in the following example:
1) At [Time] usecs after [Date and Time]
    Reason: Reset triggered due to HA policy of Reset
    Service: sysmgr stateful recovery
The fabric interconnect will recover after the unexpected reboot. Upgrading to Cisco UCSM Infrastructure Software Bundle Release 4.2(2e) or later or Release 4.2(3d) or later will resolve the issue.

Background

When using a Cisco UCS 6400 Series and 6500 Series Fabric Interconnect that is running Cisco UCSM Infrastructure Software Bundle Release 4.2(2d) or Release 4.2(3b) and logging in remotely as an administrator, a temporary user is created within the Cisco UCSM framework. A function call to synchronize the admin password to the remote fabric extenders is made. In rare situations, when this password synchronization function completes, the function can create a deadlock condition. This situation requires a system reset to clear.

Problem Symptom

During normal operation, a Cisco UCS 6400 Series and 6500 Series Fabric Interconnect may experience an unexpected reboot. 
The output of the NX-OS command show system reset-reason may show the service sysmgr stateful recovery, as in the following example:
1) At [Time] usecs after [Date and Time]
    Reason: Reset triggered due to HA policy of Reset
    Service: sysmgr stateful recovery <--
The output of the NXOS command show logging nvram may show the following information, which indicates that the fex service may have crashed:
2023 Feb  7 06:56:03  %$ VDC-1 %$ %SYSMGR-2-SERVICE_CRASHED: Service "fex" (PID 21783) hasn't caught signal 6 (core will be saved).
2023 Feb  7 06:56:03  %$ VDC-1 %$ %SYSMGR-2-HAP_FAILURE_SUP_RESET: Service "fex" in vdc 1 has had a hap failure

Workaround/Solution

Logging in to a Cisco UCS 6400 Series and 6500 Series Fabric Interconnect as a remote user triggers user creation and password synchronization with the fabric extender, potentially causing the fabric interconnect to reboot. Avoid using remote users (such as LDAP accounts) to access Cisco UCSM through the GUI, the XML API, or the CLI. Use a local account instead.
Logging in to Cisco UCSM through Cisco Intersight cross-launch does not trigger this issue and is a safe, viable alternative.
Customers should upgrade to Cisco UCSM Infrastructure Software Bundle Release 4.2(2e) or later or Release 4.2(3d) or later to resolve this problem.
