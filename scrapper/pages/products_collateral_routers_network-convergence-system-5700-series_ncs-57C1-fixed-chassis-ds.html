    Product overview
The internet bandwidth usage continues to grow as more people come online for the first time and more devices are connected per user. With this trend, it is no surprise that the demand for high-capacity systems and larger port densities is increasing rapidly. At the same time, we still also have a need for lower port densities to aggregate traffic from multiple channels.
With these requirements in mind, we designed the NCS-57C1-48Q6-SYS. It is a fixed chassis that combines low port densities of 1GE/10GE/25GE with higher port densities of 50GE/100GE/400GE and QSFP-DD optics, deep packet buffering, MACsec, Class C 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP), and Synchronous Ethernet (SyncE) in an extremely power-efficient, 1-rack-unit package.

Cisco IOS XR software overview
The Cisco NCS-57C1 is powered by an industry-leading, carrier-class, 64-bit version of IOS XR7 network operating system, designed on operational efficiency, optimized utilization, and service agility (evolved programmable network). Cisco IOS XR Software offers rich features such as iPXE boot, auto provisioning, native support for third-party application hosting, machine-to-machine interface, telemetry, and flexible software package delivery.
