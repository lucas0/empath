What is software-defined networking (SDN)?
SDN is an architecture designed to make a network more flexible and easier to manage. SDN centralizes management by abstracting the control plane from the data forwarding function in the discrete networking devices.
SDN elements
An SDN architecture delivers a centralized, programmable network and consists of the following:
A controller, the core element of an SDN architecture, that enables centralized management and control, automation, and policy enforcement across physical and virtual network environments
Southbound APIs that relay information between the controller and the individual network devices (such as switches, access points, routers, and firewalls)
Northbound APIs that relay information between the controller and the applications and policy engines, to which an SDN looks like a single logical network device
SDN adoption
SDN has seen wide adoption across data centers (64%), WANs (58%), and access networks (40%). For more information on SDN trends, see the 2020 Global Networking Trends report.
SDN and IBN
SDN serves as a foundational element of a comprehensive intent-based networking (IBN) architecture. SDN has been limited to automated provisioning and configuration. IBN now adds "translation" and "assurance" so you can automate the complete network lifecycle and continuously align the network to business needs. Watch our Beyond SDN webinar recording to explore more ways that intent is changing how we network.
