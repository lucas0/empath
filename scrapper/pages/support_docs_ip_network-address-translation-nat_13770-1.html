Introduction
This document provides a sample configuration with the ip nat outside source list command, and includes a brief description of what happens to the IP packet during the NAT process. You can use this command to translate the source address of the IP packets that travel from outside of the network to inside the network. This action translates the destination address of the IP packets that travel in the opposite direction—from inside to outside of the network. This command is useful in situations such as overlapping networks, where the inside network addresses overlap addresses that are outside the network. Let us consider the network diagram as an example.

Network Diagram
This document uses this network setup:
When ping is sourced from the Router 2514W Loopback0 interface (172.16.88.1) to the Router 2501E Loopback0 interface (171.68.1.1), this occurs:
The Router 2514W forwards the packets to Router 2514X because it is configured with a default route. On the outside interface of Router 2514X, the packet has a source address (SA) of 172.16.88.1 and a Destination Address (DA) of 171.68.1.1. Because the SA is permitted in access-list 1, which is used by the ip nat outside source list command, it is translated to an address from the NAT pool Net171. Notice that the ip nat outside source list command references the NAT pool "Net171". In this case, the address is translated to 171.68.16.10 which is the first available address in the NAT pool. After translation, Router 2514X looks for the destination in the routing table, and routes the packet. Router 2501E sees the packet on its incoming interface with a SA of 171.68.16.10 and a DA of 171.68.1.1. It responds by sending an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo reply to 171.68.16.10. If it doesn't have a route, it drops the packet. In this case, it has a (default) route, so it sends a packet to Router 2514X, using an SA of 171.68.1.1 and a DA of 171.68.16.10. Router 2514X sees the packet on its inside interface and checks for a route to the 171.68.16.10 address. If it does not have one, it responds with an ICMP unreachable reply. In this case, it has a route to 171.68.16.10, due to the add-route option of the ip nat outside source command which adds a host route based on the translation between the outside global and outside local address, so it translates the packet back to the 172.16.88.1 address, and routes the packet out its outside interface.

Verify
This section provides information you can use to confirm that your configuration is works properly.
Certain show commands are supported by the Output Interpreter Tool (registered customers only) , which allows you to view an analysis of show command output.
The show ip nat translations command can be used to check the translation entries, as shown in the output below.
2514X# show ip nat translations

2514X#
The above output shows that the Outside Global address 172.16.88.1, which is the address on Loopback0 interface of router 2514W, gets translated to the Outside Local address 171.68.16.10.
You can use the show ip route command to check the routing table entries, as shown:
2514X# show ip route

The output shows a /32 route for the Outside Local address 171.68.16.10, which is created due to the add-route option of the ip nat outside source command. This route is used for routing and translating packets that travel from the inside to the outside of the network.
Troubleshoot
This section provides information you can use to troubleshoot your configuration.
This output is the result of running the debug ip packet and debug ip nat commands on Router 2514X, while pinging from the Router 2514W loopback0 interface address (172.16.88.1) to the Router 2501E loopback0 interface address (171.68.1.1):
*Mar  1 00:02:48.079: NAT*: s=172.16.88.1->171.68.16.10, d=171.68.1.1 [95]

!--- The source address in the first packet arriving on !--- the outside interface is first translated. 

*Mar  1 00:02:48.119: IP: tableid=0, s=171.68.16.10 (Serial1), d=171.68.1.1 (Ethernet1), routed via
RIB
*Mar  1 00:02:48.087: IP: s=171.68.16.10 (Serial1), d=171.68.1.1 (Ethernet1), g=171.68.192.201, len
100, forward

!--- The ICMP echo request packet with the translated source address !--- is routed and forwarded on the inside interface. 
 
*Mar  1 00:02:48.095: IP: tableid=0, s=171.68.1.1 (Ethernet1), d=171.68.16.10 (Serial1), routed via
RIB

!--- The ICMP echo reply packet arriving on the inside interface !--- is first routed based on the destination address. 
 
*Mar  1 00:02:48.099: NAT: s=171.68.1.1, d=171.68.16.10->172.16.88.1 [95]

!--- The destination address in the packet is then translated. 
 

*Mar  1 00:02:48.103: IP: s=171.68.1.1 (Ethernet1), d=172.16.88.1 (Serial1), g=172.16.191.254, len 1
00, forward

!--- The ICMP echo reply packet with the translated destination !--- address is forwarded on the outside interface. 
The above procedure is repeated for every packet received on the outside interface.
Summary
The major difference between using the ip nat outside source list command (dynamic NAT) instead of the ip nat outside source static command (static NAT) is that there are no entries in the translation table until the router (configured for NAT) verifies the translation criteria of the packet. In the example above, the packet with the SA 172.16.88.1 (which comes into the outside interface of Router 2514X) satisfies access-list 1, the criteria used by the ip nat outside source list command. For this reason, packets must originate from the outside network before packets from the inside network can communicate with the Router 2514W loopback0 interface.
There are two important things to note in this example.
First, when the packet travels from outside to inside, translation occurs first, and then the routing table is checked for the destination. When the packet is travels from inside to outside, the routing table is checked for the destination first, and then translation occurs.
Second, it's important to note which part of the IP packet gets translated when using each of the commands above. The following table contains a guideline:
Command Action
ip nat outside source list
translates the source of the IP packets that are traveling outside to inside
translates the destination of the IP packets that are traveling inside to outside
ip nat inside source list
translates the source of IP packets that are traveling inside to outside
translates the destination of the IP packets that are traveling outside to inside
What the above guidelines indicate is that there is more than one way to translate a packet. Depending on your specific needs, you should determine how to define the NAT interfaces (inside or outside) and what routes the routing table should contain before or after translation. Keep in mind that the portion of the packet that will be translated depends upon the direction the packet is traveling, and how you configured NAT.
