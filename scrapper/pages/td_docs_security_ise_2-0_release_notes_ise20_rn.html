Introduction
The Cisco ISE platform is a comprehensive, next-generation, contextually-based access control solution. It offers authenticated network access, profiling, posture, BYOD device onboarding (native supplicant and certificate provisioning), guest management, and security group access services along with monitoring, reporting, and troubleshooting capabilities on a single physical or virtual appliance. Cisco ISE is available on two physical appliances with different performance characterization, and also as software that can be run on a VMware server. You can add more appliances to a deployment for performance, scale, and resiliency.
Cisco ISE has a scalable architecture that supports standalone and distributed deployments, but with centralized configuration and management. It also allows for configuration and management of distinct personas and services. This feature gives you the ability to create and apply services where they are needed in the network, but still operate the Cisco ISE deployment as a complete and coordinated system.
New Features in Cisco ISE, Release 2.0
Cisco ISE, Release 2.0 offers the following features and services. Refer to Cisco Identity Services Engine Admin Guide, Release 2.0 for more information.

TACACS+ Device Administration
Note Cisco ISE requires a Device Administration license to use the TACACS+ service. The Device Administration license is a perpetual license. If you are upgrading from an earlier release to Cisco ISE, Release 2.0 and would like to enable the TACACS+ service, you must order the Device Administration license as a separate add-on license. You need one Device Administration license for the entire ISE deployment.
Cisco ISE supports device administration using the TACACS+ security protocol to control and audit the configuration of network devices. The network devices are configured to query ISE for authentication and authorization of device administrator actions, and send accounting messages for ISE to log the actions. It facilitates granular control of who can access which network device and change the associated network settings. An ISE administrator can create policy sets that allow TACACS results, such as command sets and shell profiles, to be selected in authorization policy rules in a device administration access service. The ISE Monitoring node provides enhanced reports related to device administration. The Device Administration Work Center menu contains all the device administration pages, which acts as a single start point for ISE administrators.
Third-Party Device Support
Cisco ISE supports some third-party network access devices (NADs) through the use of network device profiles. These profiles define the capabilities that Cisco ISE uses to enable flows such as Guest, BYOD, MAB, and Posture.
Cisco ISE includes predefined profiles for network devices from several vendors. Cisco ISE 2.0 has been tested with the vendor devices listed in Table 1 .

Requires CoA and URL- redirect support
You can create custom NAD profiles for additional third-party network devices that do not have a predefined profile. For flows such as Guest, BYOD, and Posture, the device needs to support RFC 5176, “Change of Authorization” (CoA), and a URL Redirection mechanism capable of redirecting to Cisco ISE portals. Support for these flows depends on the NAD’s capabilities. You may need to refer to the device's administration guide for information on many of the attributes required for a network device profile. For information on how to create custom NAD profiles, refer to the Network Access Device Profiles with Cisco Identity Services Engine document.
If you have deployed non-Cisco NADs prior to Release 2.0 and created policy rules/RADIUS dictionaries to use them, after upgrade these will continue to work as usual.
For more information on Network Device Profiles and how to create, import, and export them, see “Manage Network Devices” chapter in the Cisco Identity Services Engine Administration Guide.
TrustSec Dashboard
The TrustSec dashboard is a centralized monitoring tool for the TrustSec network. The Metrics dashlet displays statistics about the behavior of the TrustSec network. The Active SGT Sessions dashlet displays the SGT sessions that are currently active in the network. The Alarms dashlet displays the alarms related to the TrustSec sessions. The Quick View dashlet displays TrustSec-related information for NADs and SGTs.
Click the TrustSec Sessions link in the Live Log dashlet to view the active TrustSec sessions. You can also view information regarding TrustSec protocol data requests and responses from NADs to Cisco ISE.
TrustSec Matrix Enhancements
Cisco ISE allows you to create, name, and save the custom views. To create custom views, choose Show > Create Custom View. You can also update the view criteria or delete unused views.
You can use the following options in the View drop-down list in the Egress Policy page to change the matrix view:
Condensed with SGACL names—If you select this option, the empty cells are hidden and the SGACL names are displayed in the cells.
Condensed without SGACL names—The empty cells are hidden and the SGACL names are not displayed in the cells. This view is useful when you want to see more matrix cells and differentiate between the content of the cells using colors, patterns, and icons (cell status).
Full with SGACL names—If you select this option, the left and upper menus are hidden and the SGACL names are displayed in the cells.
Full without SGACL names—When this option is selected, the matrix is displayed in full screen mode and the SGACL names are not displayed in the cells.
You can change the appearance settings. The following options are available:
Custom theme—The default theme (colors with no patterns) is displayed initially. You can set your own colors and patterns.
Default theme—Predefined list of colors with no patterns (not editable).
Accessibility theme—Predefined list of colors with patterns (not editable).
To make the matrix more readable, you can apply coloring and patterns to the matrix cells based on the cell contents. The following display types are available:
Permit IP/Permit IP Log—Configured inside the cell
Deny IP/Deny IP Log—Configured inside the cell
SGACLs—For SGACLs configured inside the cell
Permit IP/Permit IP Log (Inherited)—Taken from the default policy (for non-configured cells)
Deny IP/Deny IP Log (Inherited)—Taken from the default policy (for non-configured cells)
SGACLs (Inherited)—Taken from the default policy (for non-configured cells)
The status icons are used to display the status of the cell.
To configure the TrustSec Matrix settings, choose Work Centers > TrustSec > Settings > TrustSec Matrix Settings.
TrustSec Work Center
All TrustSec-related options are consolidated under the TrustSec Work Center menu (Work Centers > TrustSec), so that the administrator can easily access all the TrustSec options at one location.
Automatic SGT Creation
Cisco ISE allows you to create SGTs automatically while creating the authorization policy rules. The auto created SGTs are named based on the rule attributes.
When this option is enabled, "Auto Security Group Creation is On" message is displayed at the top of the Authorization Policy page. Click the plus (+) sign displayed in the Permissions field to edit the SGT name and value.
By default, this option is disabled after fresh install or upgrade.
Support for SXP
Source Group Tag (SGT) Exchange Protocol (SXP) is used to propagate the SGTs across network devices that do not have hardware support for TrustSec. SXP is used to transport an endpoint's SGT along with the IP address from one SGT-aware network device to another.
To enable SXP service on a node, check the Enable SXP Service check box in the General Node Settings page. You must also specify the interface to be used for SXP service.
Each SXP connection has one peer designated as SXP speaker and the other peer as SXP listener. The peers can also be configured in a bi-directional mode where each of them act as both speaker and listener. Connections can be initiated by either peers, but mapping information is always propagated from a speaker to a listener.
Location Based Authorization
Cisco ISE integrates with Cisco Mobility Services Engine (MSE) to introduce physical location-based authorization. Cisco ISE uses information from MSE to provide differentiated network access based on the actual location of the user, as reported by MSE.
With this feature, you can use the endpoint location information to provide network access when a user is in an appropriate zone. You can also add the endpoint location as an additional attribute for policies to define more granulated policy authorization sets based on device location. You can configure conditions within authorization rules that use location-based attributes, for example:
MSE.Location Equals LND_Campus1:Building1:Floor2:SecureZone
You can define the location hierarchy (campus/building/floor structure) and configure the secure and non-secure zones using the Cisco Prime Infrastructure application. After defining the location hierarchy, you must synchronize the location hierarchy data with the MSE servers.
The Location Tree is created by using the location data retrieved from the MSE instances. You can select the location entries that are exposed to the authorization policy by using the Location Tree.
Support for Boolean Attributes
Cisco ISE supports retrieving Boolean attributes from Active Directory and LDAP identity stores. You can configure the Boolean attributes while configuring the directory attributes for Active Directory or LDAP. These attributes are retrieved upon authentication with Active Directory or LDAP.
The Boolean attributes can be used for configuring policy rule conditions.
The Boolean attribute values are fetched from Active Directory or LDAP server as String type.
If you configure a Boolean attribute (for example, msTSAllowLogon) as String type, the Boolean value of the attribute in the Active Directory or LDAP server will be set for the String attribute in Cisco ISE. You can change the attribute type to Boolean or add the attribute manually as Boolean type.
Support for EAP-TTLS Protocol
EAP-TTLS is a two-phase protocol that extends the functionality of EAP-TLS protocol. Phase 1 builds the secure tunnel and derives the session keys used in Phase 2 to securely tunnel attributes and inner method data between the server and the client.
Cisco ISE can process authentications from a variety of TTLS supplicants including:
AnyConnect Network Access Manager (NAM) on Windows
Windows 8.1 native supplicant
Secure W2 (also called as JoinNow on MultiOS)
MAC OS X native supplicant
IOS native supplicant
Android based native supplicant
Linux WPA supplicant
KVM Hypervisor Support
Cisco ISE supports KVM hypervisor on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.0.
KVM virtualization requires virtualization support from the host processor; Intel VT-x for Intel processors and AMD-V for AMD processors. Open a terminal window on the host and enter the cat /proc/cpuinfo command. You must see either the vmx or the svm flag.
See the Installing Cisco ISE on a Linux KVM chapter in the Cisco Identity Services Engine Hardware Installation Guide, Release 2.0 for more information.
Cisco ISE Telemetry
The Cisco ISE Telemetry banner appears as soon as you log in to the Admin portal. Cisco ISE securely collects non-sensitive information about your deployment, network access devices, profiler, and other services that you are using. The data that is collected will be used to provide better services and additional features to you in forthcoming releases.
Cisco securely collects Telemetry information to better understand Cisco ISE usage and to improve the product and the various services that it offers. By default, the telemetry feature is enabled. If you do not want to participate in Cisco ISE Telemetry, you can disable it from the ISE Admin Portal (Administration > System > Settings > Telemetry Settings).
Certificate Provisioning Portal
The Certificate Provisioning portal allows employees to request certificates for devices that cannot go through the onboarding flow. For example, devices such as point-of-sale terminals cannot go through the BYOD flow and need to be issued certificates manually. The Certificate Provisioning portal allows a privileged set of users to upload a certificate request for such devices, generate key pairs (if required), and download the certificate. Employees can access this portal and request for a single certificate or make a bulk certificate request using a CSV file.
Certificate Template Extension
The Cisco ISE Internal CA includes an extension to represent the certificate template that was used to create the endpoint certificate. All endpoint certificates issued by the internal CA contain a certificate template name extension. You can use the CERTIFICATE: Template Name attribute in authorization policy conditions and assign appropriate access privileges based on the results of the evaluation.
Cisco ISE Internal CA Issues Certificates to ASA VPN Users
The internal ISE CA can issue certificates to client machines that connect over ASA VPN. Cisco ISE uses the Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) for enrollment and to provision certificates to the client machines.
GUI-Based Upgrade
Cisco ISE offers a GUI-based centralized upgrade from the Admin portal. The upgrade process is much simplified and the progress of the upgrade and the status of the nodes are displayed on screen.
Note The GUI-based upgrade is applicable only if you are upgrading from Release 2.0 to a higher release.
Technical Support Tunnel for Advanced Troubleshooting
Cisco ISE uses the Cisco IronPort Tunnel infrastructure to create a secure tunnel for Cisco technical support engineers to connect to an ISE server in your deployment and troubleshoot issues with the system. Cisco ISE uses SSH to create the secure connection through the tunnel. As an administrator, you can control the tunnel access; you can choose when and how long to grant access to the support engineer. Cisco Customer Support cannot establish the tunnel without your intervention. You will receive notification about the service logins. You can disable the tunnel connection at any point of time.
Mobile Device Management Enhancements
Cisco ISE 2.0 allows endpoints that were enrolled on an active MDM server outside of an ISE network to connect to an ISE network without needing to re-enroll with the MDM server.
When the endpoint connects to the ISE network, the MDM portal queries the MDM server for the endpoint. If the server returns the endpoint as compliant, ISE issues a change of authorization and allows the endpoint on the network. If the endpoint is not enrolled with the MDM server, it will have to go through the enrollment process.
Support for Meraki Mobile Device Management
Cisco ISE supports Meraki MDM server.
pxGrid Enhancements
ISE 2.0 allows a pxGrid client to create and set up a new capability without needing to update all of the other participants in the grid. Administrators can enable the new capability on the Administration > pxGrid Services > View by Capabilities page.
Guest Enhancements
A sponsor can now change the guest type of an existing guest account in the Sponsor portal.
Profiler Enhancements
IPv6 addressing is supported for some features. See IPv6 Support for more information.
Posture Enhancements
Cisco ISE supports the following:
Disk Encryption Check to protect information that goes on to a disk and to prevent unauthorized access to data storage. You can associate a Disk Encryption condition with a posture requirement only when you use the AnyConnect ISE posture agent.
SHA-256 File Check to provide a more secure way for administrators to check the file integrity.
Property List File Check for OS X for the administrator to check the value of a specified property in a specified file.
Daemon Check Enhancement for OS X to allow the administrator to check the running status of the daemon or user agent.
Additional Variables for File Check to provide variables for user directories so that the administrator can create file check in user directories.
Client Provisioning Enhancements
You can configure multiple WiFi SSIDs (NSP profiles) with a single run of the SPW. The first profile will be the active profile. For Windows and Mac, the proxy settings of the first profile will be applied globally (for all subsequent profiles). The Proxy Auto-Config File URL will be used for automatic configuration of proxy settings, which is supported by iOS, MAC OS, Windows, and Android 5.0 or above. If no Proxy Auto-Config File URL is defined, the proxy host/port will be used for all operating systems. However, the proxy host/port is used for all Android versions before 5.x.
IPv6 Support
Cisco ISE, Release 2.0 supports the following IPv6 capabilities:
Support for IPv6-enabled Endpoints: Cisco ISE can detect, manage, and secure IPv6 traffic from endpoints. You can configure authorization profiles and policies in Cisco ISE using IPv6 attributes to process requests from IPv6-enabled endpoints and ensure that the endpoint is compliant.
IPv6 Support in Reports: Reports in Release 2.0 support IPv6 values. The Live Session and Live Authentication pages also support IPv6 values.
IPv6 Support in CLI: Release 2.0 supports IPv6 in the following CLI commands:
– ipv6 address—To allow for static IPv6 address configuration per network interface
– ipv6 enable—To enable or disable IPv6 on all network interfaces
– ipv6 route—To configure IPv6 static routes
– ip host—To add IPv6 addresses in host local table
– show IPv6 route—To display IPv6 routes
Refer to the Cisco Identity Services Engine CLI Reference Guide for more information on these commands.
Cisco ISE License Information
Cisco ISE licensing provides the ability to manage the application features and access, such as the number of concurrent endpoints that can use Cisco ISE network resources.
Licenses apply to wireless and VPN only, or Wired only for LAN deployments. It is supplied in different packages as Base, Plus, Plus AC, Apex, Apex AC, Device Administration, Mobility, and Mobility Upgrade.
All Cisco ISE appliances are supplied with a 90-day Evaluation license. To continue to use Cisco ISE services after the 90-day Evaluation license expires, and to support more than 100 concurrent endpoints on the network, you must obtain and register Base licenses for the number of concurrent users on your system. If you require additional functionality, you will need Plus and/or Apex licenses to enable that functionality.
Note Cisco ISE requires a Device Administration license to use the TACACS+ feature. See the TACACS+ Device Administration feature description for more information.
Cisco ISE, Release 2.0, supports licenses with two UIDs. You can obtain a license based on the UIDs of both the primary and secondary Administration nodes.
For more detailed information on license types and obtaining licenses for Cisco ISE, see the “Cisco ISE Licenses” chapter in the Cisco Identity Services Engine Administration Guide, Release 2.0.
For more information on Cisco ISE, Release 2.0 licenses, see the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) Data Sheet.
Deployment Terminology, Node Types, and Personas
Cisco ISE provides a scalable architecture that supports both standalone and distributed deployments.
Table 2 Cisco ISE Deployment Terminology
Term
Description
Service
Specific feature that a persona provides such as network access, profiler, posture, security group access, and monitoring.
Node
Individual instance that runs the Cisco ISE software. Cisco ISE is available as an appliance and also as software that can be run on a VMware server. Each instance (either running on a Cisco ISE appliance or on a VMware server) that runs the Cisco ISE software is called a node.
Persona
Determines the services provided by a node. A Cisco ISE node can assume any or all of the following personas: Administration, Policy Service, and Monitoring.
Deployment Model
Determines if your deployment is a standalone, high availability in standalone (a basic two-node deployment), or distributed deployment.
Types of Nodes and Personas
A Cisco ISE network has the following types of nodes:
Cisco ISE node, which can assume any of the following personas:
– Administration—Allows you to perform all administrative operations for Cisco ISE. It handles all system-related configurations related to functionality such as authentication, authorization, auditing, and so on. In a distributed environment, you can have one or a maximum of two nodes running the Administration persona and configured as a primary and secondary pair. If the Primary Administration Node goes down, you can manually promote the Secondary Administration Node or configure automatic failover for administration persona.
For more information on configuring automatic failover, see the “Configure Primary Administration Node for Automatic Failover” section in the Cisco Identity Services Engine Administration Guide, Release 2.0.
– Policy Service—Provides network access, posturing, BYOD device onboarding (native supplicant and certificate provisioning), guest access, and profiling services. This persona evaluates the policies and makes all the decisions. You can have more than one node assuming this persona. Typically, there is more than one Policy Service persona in a distributed deployment. All Policy Service personas that reside behind a load balancer can be grouped together to form a node group. If one of the nodes in a node group fails, the other nodes in that group process the requests of the node that has failed, thereby providing high availability.
Note At least one node in your distributed setup should assume the Policy Service persona.
– Monitoring—Enables Cisco ISE to function as a log collector and store log messages from all the Administration and Policy Service personas on the Cisco ISE nodes in your network. This persona provides advanced monitoring and troubleshooting tools that you can use to effectively manage your network and resources.
A node with this persona aggregates and correlates the data that it collects to provide meaningful reports. Cisco ISE allows a maximum of two nodes with this persona that can assume primary or secondary roles for high availability. Both the primary and secondary Monitoring personas collect log messages. In case the primary Monitoring persona goes down, the secondary Monitoring persona automatically assumes the role of the primary Monitoring persona.
Note At least one node in your distributed setup should assume the Monitoring persona. It is recommended that the Monitoring persona be on a separate, designated node for higher performance in terms of data collection and reporting.
– pxGrid—Cisco pxGrid is a method for network and security devices to share data with other devices through a secure publish and subscribe mechanism. These services are applicable for applications that are used external to ISE and that interface with pxGrid. The pxGrid services can share contextual information across the network to identify the policies and to share common policy objects. This extends the policy management.

Upgrading Cisco ISE Software
You can directly upgrade to Cisco ISE, Release 2.0, from any of the following releases:
Cisco ISE, Release 1.3
Cisco ISE, Release 1.4
If you are on a version earlier than Cisco ISE, Release 1.3, you must first upgrade to one of the releases listed above and then upgrade to Release 2.0.
Note If you have installed a hot patch, roll back the hot patch before applying an upgrade patch.
Follow the upgrade instructions in the Cisco Identity Services Engine Upgrade Guide, Release 2.0 to upgrade to Cisco ISE, Release 2.0.
Note When you upgrade to Cisco ISE, Release 2.0, you may be required to open network ports that were not used in previous releases of Cisco ISE. For more information, see Cisco ISE Ports Reference in the Cisco Identity Services Engine Hardware Installation Guide, Release 2.0.
Upgrade Considerations and Requirements
Read the following sections before you upgrade to Cisco ISE, Release 2.0:
Firewall Ports That Must be Open for Communication
Admin User Unable to Access the ISE Login Page Post Upgrade
Rejoin Cisco ISE with Active Directory
Sponsor Login Fails
Update Authorization Policies for New Guest Types
Other Known Upgrade Considerations and Issues
Firewall Ports That Must be Open for Communication
The replication ports have changed in Cisco ISE, Release 2.0. If you have deployed a firewall between the primary Administration node and any other node, the following ports must be open before you upgrade to Release 2.0:
TCP 1521—For communication between the primary administration node and monitoring nodes.
TCP 443—For communication between the primary administration node and all other secondary nodes.
TCP 12001—For global cluster replication.
TCP 7800 and 7802—(Applicable only if the policy service nodes are part of a node group) For PSN group clustering.
For a full list of ports that Cisco ISE, Release 2.0 uses, refer to Cisco ISE Ports Reference in the Cisco Identity Services Engine Hardware Installation Guide, Release 2.0.
Admin User Unable to Access the ISE Login Page Post Upgrade
If you had enabled certificate-based authentication for administrative access to Cisco ISE (Administration > Admin Access) before upgrade and used Active Directory as your identity source, after upgrade, you will not be able to launch the ISE Login page because Active Directory join is lost during upgrade.
Workaround
From the Cisco ISE CLI, start the ISE application in safe mode using the following command:
application start ise safe
This command brings up the Cisco ISE node in safe mode and you can use the internal admin user credentials to log in to the ISE GUI.
After you log in, you can join ISE with Active Directory.
Rejoin Cisco ISE with Active Directory
Ensure that you have the Active Directory credentials if you are using Active Directory as your external identity source. After an upgrade, you might lose Active Directory connections. If this happens, you must rejoin Cisco ISE with Active Directory. After rejoining, perform the external identity source call flows to ensure the connection.
Sponsor Login Fails
The upgrade process does not migrate all sponsor groups. Sponsor groups that are not used in the creation of guests roles are not migrated. As a result of this change, some sponsors (internal database or Active Directory users) may not be able to log in after upgrade to Release 2.0.
Check the sponsor group mapping for sponsors who are not able to log in to the sponsor portal, and map them to the appropriate sponsor group.
Update Authorization Policies for New Guest Types
After upgrading to Cisco ISE 2.0, the new guest types that are created do not match the upgraded authorization policies. You need to make sure that the authorization policies are updated with the new guest types.
Other Known Upgrade Considerations and Issues
Refer to the Cisco Identity Services Engine Upgrade Guide, Release 2.0 for other known upgrade considerations and issues.
Cisco Secure ACS to Cisco ISE Migration
You can directly migrate to Cisco ISE, Release 2.0 only from Cisco Secure ACS, Releases 5.5 and 5.6. For information about migrating from Cisco Secure ACS, Releases 5.5 and 5.6 to Cisco ISE, Release 2.0, see the Cisco Identity Services Engine Migration Tool Guide.
You cannot migrate to Release 2.0 from Cisco Secure ACS 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 4.x, or earlier versions, or from Cisco Network Admission Control (NAC) Appliance. From Cisco Secure ACS, Releases 4.x, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, or 5.4, you must upgrade to ACS, Release 5.5 or 5.6, and then migrate to Cisco ISE, Release 2.0.
Requirements for CA to Interoperate with Cisco ISE
While using a CA server with Cisco ISE, make sure that the following requirements are met:
Key size should be 1024, 2048, or higher. In CA server, the key size is defined using certificate template. You can define the key size on Cisco ISE using the supplicant profile.
Key usage should allow signing and encryption in extension.
While using GetCACapabilities through the SCEP protocol, cryptography algorithm and request hash should be supported. It is recommended to use RSA + SHA1.
Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is supported. This is not directly used in BYOD, but a CA which can act as an OCSP server can be used for certificate revocation.
Known Limitations in Cisco ISE, Release 2.0
This section lists known limitations in Release 2.0:
SXP Protocol Security Standards
Do Not Delete the Default Internal Cisco ISE CA Templates
Do not Install a Patch Until Upgrade
LDAP Imported Guest Accounts Not Upgraded from Version 1.2
LDAP Sponsor Created Guest Users Not Visible when Upgraded from 1.2
TLS Authentication on Android Devices Does Not Use Certificates Issued by the Assigned Certificate Authority
EKU Validation: OCSP Signing Certificate Returns Unknown for Root CA
Backup and Restore Page Takes a Long Time to Load
EST Service Does Not Run in Cisco ISE 2.1
SXP Protocol Security Standards
SXP protocol transfers unencrypted data and uses weak hash algorithm for message integrity checking per draft-smith-kandula-sxp-06.
High Memory Utilization
Cisco ISE Version 1.3 and later use RHEL, version 6. You may experience high memory utilization after installing or upgrading to Cisco ISE Version 1.3 or later. However, this does not negatively impact Cisco ISE performance and there are no alarms that are triggered. In case, if the memory usage is consistently above 90% or if there is any performance impact, you can contact Cisco TAC for troubleshooting.
Do Not Delete the Default Internal Cisco ISE CA Templates
The internal Cisco ISE CA comes with two default certificate templates:
CA_SERVICE_Certificate_Template—Cisco ISE uses this template to issue certificates when other network services use Cisco ISE as the CA. For example, for client machines that connect over ASA VPN.
EAP_Authentication_Certificate_Template—Cisco ISE issues certificates for EAP authentication based on this template.
Do not delete these default certificate templates. If you want to customize the certificate template, you can create a new one, or copy an existing template and edit it.
Do not Install a Patch Until Upgrade
When upgrade is in progress, do not install a patch on any node in the deployment simultaneously. Patch installation should be done after deployment upgrade is complete.
LDAP Imported Guest Accounts Not Upgraded from Version 1.2
Guests that were imported by an LDAP authenticated sponsor in version 1.2 will not be migrated during an upgrade to 1.3, 1.4, 2.0, or 2.1.
LDAP Sponsor Created Guest Users Not Visible when Upgraded from 1.2
When upgrading from 1.2 to 1.3, 1.4, 2.0, or 2.1, guests who were created by a sponsor who was authenticated through LDAP can only be seen by the direct sponsor. These guests cannot be seen by other sponsors from the same sponsor group.
TLS Authentication on Android Devices Does Not Use Certificates Issued by the Assigned Certificate Authority
This issue occurs when you have configured:
Internal and external Certificate Authority (CA) in Cisco ISE.
Two profiles (SSID1 and SSID2) for TLS authentication using the internal and external CA, respectively.
The certificates provisioned from Cisco ISE are imported in to the Android certificate store. Sometimes, the wireless networks use one of the many certificates when connecting to the network. For example, when an Android device connects to the network using SSID 1, the certificate used for authentication is issued by the internal CA. When a second Android device connects using SSID 2, the certificate used for authentication is again issued by the internal CA instead of the external CA (as configured in SSID2).
This issue is seen only in Android devices and there is no workaround.
Cisco recommends that you update your Android device with all fixes and upgrades offered by the vendor.
EKU Validation: OCSP Signing Certificate Returns Unknown for Root CA
The Bouncy Castle OCSP signing certificate returns an "unknown" response for the Root CA. If you have configured Cisco ISE to reject requests when an unknown certificate status is returned by the OCSP service, Cisco ISE rejects the certificate that is being evaluated and the user authentication fails.
This issue is seen in Bouncy Castle, version 1.6.145-generated certificates. There is no workaround.
Backup and Restore Page Takes a Long Time to Load
This issue occurs if the “Admin” certificate is configured with CRL check and the CRL server URL is not reachable from Cisco ISE.
As a workaround, you can do one of the following:
Ensure that the CRL server is reachable from Cisco ISE.
Generate a new “Admin” certificate without CRL check.
Generate a self-signed certificate for Admin usage.
EST Service Does Not Run in Cisco ISE 2.1
After a fresh installation of Cisco ISE 2.1, when you run the show application status ise command, the EST service might be shown as disabled. This issue occurs when the root certificate of the Cisco ISE internal CA is signed by an external CA and the external CA certificate is not present in your Trusted Certificates store. Import the external CA certificate in to the Trusted Certificates store to bring up the EST service.
This issue is also seen after upgrade to Release 2.1, if the entire certificate chain of the internal ISE CA is not present. You must generate the Cisco ISE CA chain to bring up the EST service.
Features Not Supported in Cisco ISE, Release 2.0
This section lists the features not supported in Release 2.0:
Inline Posture Node (IPN / iPEP)
Inline Posture Node (IPN / iPEP)
IPN / iPEP configuration is no longer supported with Cisco ISE, Release 2.0.

Caveat
Description
CSCuw88770
ISE 2.0 PEAP TLS 1.2 wireless authentication fails with Android 6 and Win 10.
This issue occurred because in TLS 1.2, the mechanism of MPPE keys generation has been changed for EAP-TLS, PEAP, and EAP-TTLS. EAP-FAST is not affected.
Symptom: Authentication reports from logs show that the authentication is successful; however, the state on the WLC of the client session is dot1x required. Wireless packet captures reveal that 4-way handshakes following EAP-success are not completing, either M1 and M2 or M1 only.
Conditions: This issue occurs when a combination of the following conditions are true:
If you have Cisco ISE, Release 2.0 FCS version with no patch installed.
Wireless LAN with L2 security configured for WPA2 Enterprise.
A device with Android 6 or Windows 10 version 1511 tries to authenticate.
Protocols used are PEAP or TTLS or EAP-TLS
Workaround:
For Android, none. You cannot configure TLS version from Android client or Cisco ISE
For Windows 10 clients, you may disable TLS 1.2 and enable TLS 1.0:
– Create DWORD HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasMan\PPP\EAP\13\TlsVersion and set the associate DWORD value to C0.
– Restart EapHost service.
