Role-Based Access Control By Resource Group
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.5.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.5.1
This feature introduces role-based access control (RBAC) based on sites or resource groups. It is a method of authorizing system access for users based on a combination of user groups and resource groups.
For large Cisco SD-WAN deployments across multiple geographical locations, this feature helps you to split the network administration among different regional administrators.
RBAC for Policies
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1
This feature allows you to create users and user groups with required read and write permissions for Cisco vManage policies. RBAC for policies provides users with the access to all the details of policies to help maximize the operational efficiency. It makes it easier to meet configuration requirements and guarantees that authorized users on the system are only given access to what they need.
Co-Management: Granular Role-Based Access Control for Feature Templates
Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1
This feature introduces greater granularity in assigning RBAC permissions for template use. This enables you to give a tenant self-management of network configuration tasks. Network administrators and managed service providers can use this feature to assign permissions to their end customers.
Co-Management: Improved Granular Configuration Task Permissions
Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1
To enable a user to self-manage specific configuration tasks, you can assign the user permissions to perform specific configuration tasks while excluding other tasks.
This feature introduces numerous new permission options, enabling fine granularity in determining which configuration task permissions to provide to a user. .
RBAC for Security Operations and Network Operations Default User Groups
Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1
This feature provides the following default user groups:
network_operations user group for non-security policies
security_operations user group for security policies
RBAC for policies allows you to create users and user groups with the required read and write permissions for security and non-security policies. Users can perform configuration and monitoring actions only for the authorized policy type.
Co-Management: Improved Granular Configuration for Resource group features
Cisco vManage Release 20.11.1
To enable a user to self-manage specific configuration tasks, you can assign the user permissions to perform specific configuration tasks while excluding other tasks.
This feature introduces new permission options for the following configuration groups and feature profiles.
AppQoE under other feature profile
GPS under transport feature profile
Cisco VPN Interface GRE under WAN/LAN profile.
Cisco VPN Interface IPsec under WAN profile.
Cisco Multicast under LAN profile.

Benefits of RBAC
Role-Based Access Control by VPN
Role-based access control (RBAC) is the process of restricting user access to network configurations and resources. In RBAC, users are assigned roles depending on the resources they need access to. The RBAC by VPN feature helps you to manage and control access to your network based on the VPNs. It involves setting permissions and privileges to enable access to authorized users.
RBAC by VPN
Role-based access by VPN allows a network administrator to define VPN groups with one or more network segments. The network administrator can associate a user with a VPN group that restricts user access to devices in the network and features of Cisco vManage.
RBAC by VPN provides the following restricted access to users configured with a VPN group:
Access to VPN Dashboard
Monitor devices, network, and application status via VPN dashboard
VPN dashboard information restricted to devices with segments in the VPN group
Monitor option restricted to devices with segments in the VPN group
Interface monitoring on each device restricted to interfaces of segments in the VPN group
VPN Dashboard Overview
Users configured with VPN group can access only the VPN Dashboard, and it is read-only access. User with Admin access can create the VPN groups and has access to both Admin Dashboard and VPN Dashboard(s). Admin user can access these dashboards by choosing Dashboard from the Cisco vManage menu.
Role-Based Access with AAA
The Cisco SD-WAN AAA software implements role-based access to control the authorization permissions for users on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. Role-based access consists of three components:
Users are those who are allowed to log in to a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device.
User groups are collections of users.
Privileges are associated with each group. They define the commands that the group's users are authorized to issue.
Users and User Groups
All users who are permitted to perform operations on a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device must have a login account. For the login account, you configure a username and a password on the device itself. These allow the user to log in to that device. A username and password must be configured on each device that a user is allowed to access.
The Cisco SD-WAN software provides one standard username, admin, which is a user who has full administrative privileges, similar to a UNIX superuser. By default, the admin username password is admin. You cannot delete or modify this username, but you can and should change the default password.
User groups pool together users who have common roles, or privileges, on the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device. As part of configuring the login account information, you specify which user group or groups that user is a member of. You do not need to specify a group for the admin user, because this user is automatically in the user group netadmin and is permitted to perform all operations on the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device.
The user group itself is where you configure the privileges associated with that group. These privileges correspond to the specific commands that the user is permitted to execute, effectively defining the role-based access to the Cisco SD-WAN software elements.
The Cisco SD-WAN software provides the following standard user groups:
basic: The basic group is a configurable group and can be used for any users and privilege levels. This group is designed to include users who have permission to both view and modify information on the device.
operator: The operator group is also a configurable group and can be used for any users and privilege levels. This group is designed to include users who have permission only to view information.
netadmin: The netadmin group is a non-configurable group. By default, this group includes the admin user. You can add other users to this group. Users in this group are permitted to perform all operations on the device.
Minimum supported release: Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1
network_operations: The network_operations group is a non-configurable group. Users in this group can perform all non-security-policy operations on the device and only view security policy information. For example, users can create or modify template configurations, manage disaster recovery, and create non-security policies such as application aware routing policy or CFlowD policy.
Minimum supported release: Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1
security_operations: The security_operations group is a non-configurable group. Users in this group can perform all security operations on the device and only view non-security-policy information. For example, users can manage umbrella keys, licensing, IPS signatures auto update, TLS/SSL proxy settings, and so on.
Users of the network_operations group are authorized to apply policies to a device, revoke applied policies, and edit device templates. Users of the security_operations group require network_operations users to intervene on day-0 to deploy security policy on a device and on day-N to remove a deployed security policy. However, after a security policy is deployed on a device, security_operations users can modify the security policy without needing the network_operations users to intervene.

Note
Only admin users can view running and local configuration. Users associated with predefined operator user group do not have access to the running and local configurations. The predefined user group operator has only read access for the template configuration. If you need only a subset of admin user privileges, then you need to create a new user group with the selected features from the features list with both read and write access and associate the group with the custom user.
Privileges for Role-Based Access
Role-based access privileges are arranged into five categories, which are called tasks:
Interface—Privileges for controlling the interfaces on the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device.
Policy—Privileges for controlling control plane policy, OMP, and data plane policy.
Routing—Privileges for controlling the routing protocols, including BFD, BGP, OMP, and OSPF.
Security—Privileges for controlling the security of the device, including installing software and certificates. Only users belonging to the netadmin group can install software on the system.
System—General systemwide privileges.
The tables in the following sections detail the AAA authorization rules for users and user groups. These authorization rules apply to commands issued from the CLI and to those issued from Netconf.
User Authorization Rules for Operational Commands
The user authorization rules for operational commands are based simply on the username. Any user who is allowed to log in to the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device can execute most operational commands. However, only the admin user can issue commands that affect the fundamental operation of the device, such as installing and upgrading the software and shutting down the device.
Note that any user can issue the config command to enter configuration mode, and once in configuration mode, they are allowed to issue any general configuration command. Also, any user is allowed to configure their password by issuing the system aaa user self password password command and then committing that configuration change. For the actual commands that configure device operation, authorization is defined according to user group membership. See User Group Authorization Rules for Configuration Commands.
The following tables lists the AAA authorization rules for general CLI commands. All the commands are operational commands except as noted. Also, some commands available to the "admin" user are available only if that user is in the "netadmin" user group.

RBAC By Resource Group Overview
Minimum supported releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.5.1a and Cisco vManage Release 20.5.1
RBAC by resource groups is a method of restricting or authorizing system access for users based on user groups and resource groups. A user group defines the privileges of a user in the system and the resource group defines the organizations (domains) to which a user is allowed access. Because users are not directly assigned privileges, management of individual user privileges is simply a matter of assigning the appropriate user and resource groups.
For large Cisco SD-WAN deployments across multiple geographical locations, you can split the network administration among different regional adminstrators.
Based on the user groups and resources groups to which network administrators are assigned, we can broadly classify them as Global Administrators and Regional Administrators. Global administrators have access to resources in every resource group and have full read-write privileges for all the features. Regional Administrators group have full read-write privileges for all the features, but the resources they can access is controlled by the resource groups to which they are assigned.
Global Admin
User accounts in the global resource group have access to all resources. A global admin is responsible for overseeing the entire network, but not involved in the operations of the individual devices on a daily basis. The global admin can assign devices to their corresponding regions, assign the regional admin accounts, manage the controllers, maintain sharable and centralized configurations, and when necessary, operate on the individual devices.
Any user in a single tenant setup with netadmin privileges and also part of global resource group is considered as global admin. Default admin user on Cisco vManage is also a global-admin, and that user can assign more global-admins. Global resource group encompasses all the WAN edges, controllers in the single view.
Global admin can switch to view only a specific resource group and can create templates. Local resource group admins, also called regional admins can clone the global templates and reuse them within their resource groups.
Regional Admin
The regional admins are responsible for day-to-day operations (configuration, monitoring, onboarding, and so on) for devices in their corresponding regions. They should not have access to or visibility into devices outside of their region. The following user groups can be created:
resource group admin – full read/write access to devices in the corresponding resource group, can troubleshoot, monitor, attach or detach templates for the WAN edges in their group
resource group operator – read-only access to WAN edges within their resource group
resource group basic – basic access
Resource group admins can create new templates and attach or detach to the WAN edges in their group. They can also copy global templates and re-use them.
Resource group decides which resources the user has access to. However, the level of access is controlled by the existing user group.
If user is in resource_group_a and user group resource_group_admin, they have full read/write access to all resources in resource_group_a.
If user is in resource_group_a and user group resource_group_operator, they have read only access to all resources in resource_group_a.
If user is in resource_group_a and user group resource_group_basic, they have read only access to interface and system resources in resource_group_a.
Global Resource Group
Global group is a special system pre-defined resource group that has different access control rules.
Users within this group are considered as global-admins, who can have full access to all resources (devices, templates and policies) in the system and they can manage the resource groups and assign resources and users to groups.
All other users have read-only access to resources within this group.
The system default admin account (or tenantadmin account in a multi-tenant setup) is always in this group. This privilege cannot be changed. However, the admin account may add/remove other user accounts to or from this group.
IdP (SSO)-Managed Group
An identity provider (IdP) is a service that stores and verifies user identity. IdPs typically work with single sign-on (SSO) providers to authenticate users. If a user is authenticated with a SSO service of an IdP, the group information is also provided and managed by the IDP. An IdP passes the information about the user, including the user name and all the group names, where the user belongs to. Cisco vManage matches the group names with the group names stored in the database to further distinguish if a particular group name passed from IdP is for user group or resource group or VPN group.
Multi-Tenancy Support
With Cisco SD-WAN multitenancy, a service provider can manage multiple customers, called tenants, from Cisco vManage. The tenants share Cisco vManage instances, Cisco vBond Orchestrators, and Cisco vSmart Controllers. The domain name of the service provider has subdomains for each tenant. Cisco vManage is deployed and configured by the service provider. The provider enables multitenancy and creates a Cisco vManage cluster to serve tenants. Only the provider can access a Cisco vManage instance through the SSH terminal.
Provider has the following features:
resource group is not applicable as the provider manages only the controllers.
when provider provisions a new tenant, the default user account for the tenant is tenantadmin.
other user accounts created by the provider are included in the default global resource group.
when a provider creates a template for a tenant, the template is included in to the global resource group.
RBAC for Policies Overview
Minimum supported releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a and Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1
RBAC for policies allows a user or user group to have selective Read and Write (RW) access to Cisco vManage policies. For example,
A user with RW access for Cflowd policy can only configure Cflowd policy, but cannot configure application-aware routing policy.
A user with RW access for application aware routing policy can only configure application-aware routing policy, but cannot configure other policies.
This feature is only supported for centralized and localized policies, but not supported for security policies.
Information About Granular RBAC for Templates
Minimum supported release: Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1
When setting user group permissions, you can use the following template permissions to provide an RBAC user with a specific degree of access to different types of templates. This gives you control over the types of device configurations that an RBAC user can apply.
Permission
Description
CLI Add-On Template
Provides access to the CLI add-on feature template.
Device CLI Template
Provides access to the device CLI template.
SIG Template
Provides access to the SIG feature template and SIG credential template.
Other Feature Templates
Provides access to all feature templates except the SIG feature template, SIG credential template, and CLI add-on feature template.
Feature Profile
Provides access to all feature profiles.
Config Group
Provides access to all the configuration groups.
You can specify granular RBAC for each feature profile by expanding it. With the set permissions to the usergroup, ensure that you are able to access required feature profiles from Templates > Configuration Groups.
Single-Tenant and Multi-Tenant Scenarios
You can use granular RBAC for feature templates in single-tenant and multi-tenant Cisco vManage scenarios.
You can create user groups to assign specific permissions to a tenant's various teams, enabling teams to manage only specific network services without granting permission to use device CLI templates. It might be undesirable to give a tenant permission to apply device CLI templates, as the device CLI template can override any other template or device configuration.
For example, you can create a user group for a tenant's security operations group, giving them read/write access only to the SIG Template option, which would enable the security operations group to work on security configuration.
Information About Granular Configuration Task Permissions
From Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1, numerous user permission options are available, providing you fine granularity when assigning a user with permissions to manage specific configuration tasks related to configuration groups and feature profiles.
Information About Assigning Roles Locally to a User Defined by an Identity Provider
Minimum release: Cisco vManage Release 20.11.1
When you define users in an identity provider, such as Okta, for SAML SSO, one attribute that you can define for each user is the role.
When a user logs in to a Cisco vManage instance, Cisco vManage retrieves information about the user from the identity provider, including the user’s role or roles. The roles defined in the identity provider map to user group permissions in Cisco vManage. Based on the roles of the user, Cisco vManage provides the user with the permissions defined by the corresponding user group.
You can assign roles locally (not depending on the identify provider) for a user profile that does not have a role defined in the identity provider.
If you have defined roles for a user through the identity provider and have also assigned user groups locally for the same user, the roles defined through the identity provider take priority.
The following table summarizes the ways to provide a user with specific permissions:
Using or Not Using an Identity Provider for SAML SSO
Roles Defined in the Identity Provider
How User Permissions Are Defined
Not using an identity provider
Not applicable
In Cisco vManage, assign a user to one or more user groups locally. This provides the user with the corresponding user group permissions.
Using an identity provider
Identity provider has one or more roles defined for the user.
Define roles for the user through the identity provider. Cisco vManage provides the user with the user group permissions corresponding to the roles.
Identity provider does not have a role defined for the user.
Use the Remote User option when adding a user (Administration > Manage Users > Add User). See Add a User.
In Cisco vManage, assign a user to one or more user groups locally. This provides the user with the corresponding user group permissions.

Benefits of Granular RBAC for Feature Templates
Minimum supported release: Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1
The permissions that you add for co-management are useful for providing detailed control over access to network configuration. They are useful when using Cisco SD-WAN with tenants, enabling you to provide a tenant access to specific types of templates. This enables you to give the tenant self-management of network configuration tasks within the tenant's VPN.
For information about the permissions added for co-management, see Information About Granular RBAC for Templates.
Restrictions for RBAC
Restrictions for Granular RBAC for Feature Templates
Restrictions for Granular RBAC for Feature Templates
Minimum supported release: Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1
To use any of the template restriction options that are provided for RBAC for co-management, provide permissions for the Template Configuration option. If a specific user role does not have any permissions assigned in the Template Configuration option, the Templates menu does not appear for the user in Cisco vManage. See Manage Users.
To enable an RBAC user to apply templates to devices, provide Write permission to the Template Deploy option.
Use Cases for RBAC

Use Cases for Assigning Roles Locally to a User Defined by an Identity Provider
Minimum release: Cisco vManage Release 20.11.1
An organization uses the identity provider, Okta, to authenticate users logging in to Cisco vManage.
A user defined through the identity provider has not been assigned any roles. A network administrator with access to Cisco vManage, but no access to the identity provider, can locally assign the user to a specific user group to provide the user with specific permissions.

The permission options for limiting template access appear with the other permission options that you choose when adding a user group.
For information about granular RBAC for feature templates, see Information About Granular RBAC for Templates.
For information about adding a user group, see Create User Groups.
For a list of permission types and descriptions, see Manage Users.
Configure RBAC Using the CLI
Configure Users Using CLI
Creating Groups Using CLI
Configure Users Using CLI
You can use the CLI to configure user credentials on each device. This way, you can create additional users and give them access to specific devices. The credentials that you create for a user by using the CLI can be different from the Cisco vManage credentials for the user. In addition, you can create different credentials for a user on each device. All Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device users with the netadmin privilege can create a new user.
To create a user account, configure the username and password, and place the user in a group:
This example, shows the addition of user, Bob, to an existing group:
Device(config)# system aaa user bob group basic
This example, shows the addition of user, Alice, to a new group test-group:
Device(config)# system aaa user test-group
Device(config)# system aaa user alice group test-group
The Username can be 1 to 128 characters long, and it must start with a letter. The name can contain only lowercase letters, the digits 0 through 9, hyphens (-), underscores (_), and periods (.). The name cannot contain any uppercase letters. Because some usernames are reserved, you cannot configure them. For a list of reserved usernames, see the aaa configuration command in the Cisco SD-WAN Command Reference Guide.
The Password is the password for a user. Each username must have a password, and users are allowed to change their own password. The CLI immediately encrypts the string and does not display a readable version of the password. When a user logs in to a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device, they have five chances to enter the correct password. After the fifth incorrect attempt, the user is locked out of the device, and must wait for 15 minutes before attempting to log in again.

Note
Enclose any user passwords that contain the special character ! in double quotation marks (“ “). If a double quotation is not included for the entire password, the config database (?) treats the special character as a space and ignores the rest of the password.
For example, if the password is C!sc0, use “C!sc0”.
Group name is the name of a standard Cisco SD-WAN group (basic, netadmin, or operator) or of a group configured with the usergroup command (discussed below). If an admin user changes the permission of a user by changing their group, and if that user is currently logged in to the device, the user is logged out and must log back in again.
The factory-default password for the admin username is admin. We strongly recommend that you modify this password the first time you configure a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device:
Device(config)# username admin password $9$3/IL3/UF2F2F3E$J9NKBeKlWrq9ExmHk6F5VAiDMOFQfD.QPAmMxDdxz.c
Configure the password as an ASCII string. The CLI immediately encrypts the string and does not display a readable version of the password, for example:
Device(config)# show run
...
aaa authentication login default local
aaa authentication login user1 group basic
aaa authentication login user2 group operator
aaa authentication login user3 group netadmin
aaa authorization exec default local
If you are using RADIUS to perform AAA authentication, you can configure a specific RADIUS server to verify the password:
Device(config)#  radius server tag
The tag is a string that you defined with the radius server tag command, as described in the Cisco SD-WAN Command Reference Guide.
Creating Groups Using CLI
The Cisco SD-WAN software provides default user groups: basic, netadmin, operator, network_operations, and security_operations. The username admin is automatically placed in the netadmin usergroup.
If needed, you can create additional custom groups and configure privilege roles that the group members have. To create a custom group with specific authorization, configure the group name and privileges:
Device(config)# aaa authentication login user1 group radius enable
Device(config)# aaa authentication login user2 group radius enable
Device(config)# aaa authentication login user3 group radius enable
Device(config)#
group-name can be 1 to 128 characters long, and it must start with a letter. The name can contain only lowercase letters, the digits 0 through 9, hyphens (-), underscores (_), and periods (.). The name cannot contain any uppercase letters Some group names are reserved, so you cannot configure them. For a list of them, see the aaa configuration command.
If a remote RADIUS or TACACS+ server validates authentication but does not specify a user group, the user is placed into the user group basic. If a remote server validates authentication and specifies a user group (say, X) using VSA Cisco SD-WAN-Group-Name, the user is placed into that user group only. However, if that user is also configured locally and belongs to a user group (say, Y), the user is placed into both the groups (X and Y).
In the task option, list the privilege roles that the group members have. The role can be one or more of the following: interface, policy, routing, security, and system.
