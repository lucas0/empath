Support for AWS GovCloud (US) with Cisco SD-WAN Cloud OnRamp for Multicloud
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.9.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1
With the integration of Amazon Web Services (AWS) GovCloud (US) with Cisco SD-WAN Cloud OnRamp for Multicloud, you can store your highly sensitive workloads in an isolated cloud that meets the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) requirements of the U.S. government and its customers.
The same features that are available with the AWS integration with Cisco SD-WAN Cloud OnRamp for Multicloud are also available with Amazon GovCloud (US). Use the AWS Transit Gateway to connect your branch devices to the AWS GovCloud (US).

Cisco SD-WAN Cloud OnRamp for Multicloud extends support for AWS GovCloud (US), allowing you to store and manage your highly sensitive workloads in AWS GovCloud (US).
The following are examples of highly sensitive workloads that you can store in AWS GovCloud (US):
Controller Unclassified Information (CUI)
Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
Sensitive patient medical records
Financial data
Law enforcement data
Export data
The same features and workflow that are available for the AWS integration are also available with the AWS GovCloud (US) integration with the exception of support for the Transit Gateway Network Manager (TGNM).

Note
The TGNM is supported for AWS, but the TGNM is not supported for AWS GovCloud (US).
A transit gateway is a network transit hub that you can use to interconnect your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and on-premises networks. You can attach a VPC or a VPN connection to a transit gateway. The transit gateway acts as a virtual router for traffic flowing between your VPC and VPN connections. The transit gateway provides a way to interconnect VPCs and VPNs.
Cisco SD-WAN Cloud OnRamp for Multicloud uses the AWS Transit Gateway to connect your branch devices to the AWS GovCloud (US). A configuration wizard in Cisco SD-WAN Cloud OnRamp for Multicloud automates the bring-up of the transit gateway to your AWS GovCloud (US) account and automates the connections between AWS GovCloud (US) applications and branch users in the overlay network.
For more information on the AWS GovCloud, see the AWS GovCloud (US) documentation.
Configure Cisco SD-WAN Cloud OnRamp for Multicloud with AWS GovCloud (US) using Cisco SD-WAN Manager.
