About FlexAttach Virtual pWWN
FlexAttach virtual pWWN feature facilitates server and configuration management. In a SAN environment, the server installation or replacement, requires interaction and coordination among the SAN and server administrators. For coordination, it is important that the SAN configuration does not change when a new server is installed, or when an existing server is replaced. FlexAttach virtual pWWN minimizes the interaction between the server administrator and the SAN administrator by abstracting the real pWWN using virtual pWWNs.
When FlexAttach virtual pWWN is enabled on an interface, a virtual pWWN is assigned to the server interface. The real pWWN is replaced by a virtual pWWN, which is used for a SAN configuration such as zoning.
Server administrators can benefit from FlexAttach in the following scenarios:
•Pre-configure—Pre-configure SAN for new servers that are not available physically yet. For example, they may be on order. FlexAttach can be enabled on the ports designated for the new servers and use the virtual WWNs assigned for configuring SAN. The new servers are then plugged into the fabric without any change needed in the SAN.
•Replacement to the same port—A failed server can be replaced onto the same port without changing the SAN. The new server gets a same pWWN as the failed server because the virtual pWWN is assigned to the port.
•Replacement to (spare)—A spare server, which is on the same NPV device or a different NPV device) can be brought online without changes to the SAN. This action is achieved by moving the virtual port WWN from the current server port to the spare port.
•Server Mobility—A server can be moved to another port on the same NPV device or another NPV device without changing the SAN. This is accomplished by moving the virtual pWWN to the new port. No change is needed if FlexAttach was configured using the physical port WWN of the server to the virtual port WWN mapping.
FlexAttach Virtual pWWN Guidelines and Requirements
Following are recommended guidelines and requirements when deploying FlexAttach virtual pWWN:
•FlexAttach configuration is supported only on NPV switches.
•Cisco Fabric Services (CFS) IP version 4 (IPv4) distribution should be enabled.
•Virtual WWNs should be unique across the fabric.
Configuring FlexAttach Virtual pWWN
This section describes how to configure FlexAttach virtual pWWN feature and includes the following topics:
•Enabling FlexAttach Virtual pWWN
•Debugging FlexAttach Virtual pWWN
•Security Settings for FlexAttach Virtual pWWN
•FlexAttach Virtual pWWN CFS Distribution
Enabling FlexAttach Virtual pWWN
The FlexAttach virtual pWWN feature is enabled automatically, manually, or by mapping pWWN to virtual pWWN. Figure 10-1 shows how the FlexAttach virtual pWWN feature is enabled.
Automatically Enabling FlexAttach Virtual pWWN
The virtual pWWN is enabled automatically on all the NPV switches or per port on the NPV box. When enabled automatically, a virtual WWN is generated from the device switch WWN. This WWN is used as the virtual pWWN. Virtual pWWNs are generated using the local switch WWNs.
Note The port must be in a shut state when the virtual pWWN is enabled.
To enable virtual pWWN automatically for all the interfaces, follow these steps:
Step 1 From the Device Manger menu bar, select FC > FlexAttach. (Figure 10-1).
Figure 10-1 FlexAttach in Device Manager
You see the FlexAttach window. (Figure 10-2).
Figure 10-2 FlexAttach Window in Device Manager
Step 2 Check the VirtualPwwnAuto check box to enable automatic generation of virtual WWNs on all the fabric port interfaces.
Note•When the interface-list value is not included in the command, virtual pWWN is enabled globally.
•All the interfaces mentioned in the interface-list value must be in a shut state.
Launching FlexAttach in Fabric Manager
To launch FlexAttach in Fabric Manager, follow these steps:
Step 1 In the Logical Domains pane, select a switch.
Step 2 In the Physical Attributes pane, expand Switches > NPIV.
Step 3 Select NPIV > N_Port Virtualizer (NPV) > FlexAttach.
The FlexAttach configuration pane appears to the right. (Figure 10-3).
Figure 10-3 FlexAttach Menu
Manually Enabling FlexAttach Virtual pWWN
You can manually assign a WWN to the interface, without generating it through the switch. Several checks are done by the NPV core to ensure the uniqueness of virtual pWWNs in the switch. When duplicate virtual pWWNs are configured, the subsequent logins are rejected by the NPV core switch.
Note•Some ports may be in automode, some in manual mode, and the virtual pWWNs need not be assigned.
•The port must be in a shut state when a virtual pWWN is enabled.
To enable virtual pWWN on each interface manually, follow these steps:
Step 1 Click the Virtual PWWN tab.
A list of interfaces is displayed. (Figure 10-4).
Figure 10-4 Virtual PWWN Tab View in Device Manager
The Virtual pWWN tab view displays a list of the interfaces.
Step 2 Check the Auto check box to automatically generate the virtual pWWN value for the selected interface.
Note The interface mentioned in the interface value must be in a shut state.
The virtual port WWN value for the selected interface in Fabric Manager is automatically generated. (Figure 10-5).
Figure 10-5 Virtual pWWN Tab View in Fabric Manager
Note The interface mentioned in the interface value must be in a shut state.
Mapping pWWN to Virtual pWWN
You can configure virtual pWWNs through real pWWNs. This process is required for NPIV hosts containing multiple pWWNs, of which only FLOGI is mapped to the virtual pWWN. Subsequent FDSIDs will have different mappings.
Several checks are done by the NPV core to ensure the uniqueness of virtual pWWNs in the switch across the NPV switches. When duplicate virtual pWWNs are configured, the subsequent logins are rejected by the NPV core switch.
To map pWWN to virtual pWWN, follow these steps:
Step 1 In the FlexAttach window, select the Physical to Virtual WWNs tab.
You see the Physical to Virtual WWNs tab view (see Figure 10-6).
Figure 10-6 Physical to Virtual WWNs Tab View in Device Manager
The LastChange field displays the time when the virtual pWWN was changed.
Note The interface must be in a shut state and the specified virtual pWWN should not be logged in.
The Figure 10-7 shows the Physical to Virtual pWWNs tab view in the Fabric Manager.
Figure 10-7 Physical to Virtual pWWNs Tab View in Fabric Manager
Note The specified virtual pWWN and the real pWWN must not be logged in.
Debugging FlexAttach Virtual pWWN
Table 10-1 lists the errors that might be displayed and provides the workarounds.
Table 10-1
Error
Description
Workaround
fc1/1 : interface is not down
FlexAttach configuration fails because the configuration is enabled for an active interface with the operation state as up.
To move the port to the shut state, enable the FlexAttach configuration, and then move the port to no shut state.
FlexAttach configuration is not distributed to the peers
The FlexAttach configuration on one peer NPV is not available to any other peer NPV.
FlexAttach configuration will not be distributed if cfs ipv4 distribute, or cfs ipv6 distribute is disabled. Enable cfs ipv4 distribute, or cfs ipv6 distribute.
Even with CFS distribution enabled Inagua does not become a peer with other NPVs
CFS over IP is enabled, and the Inagua in one blade center is not the peer NPV for other NPVs.
CFS over IP uses IP multicast to discover the NPV peers in the network. IBM MM does not support multicast and cannot act as a peer with NPV. This prevents the FlexAttach configuration from getting disrtibuted to other peer NPVs in the network.
NP port uses physical pWWN instead of virtual pWWN confgured through FlexAttach
This occurs when NP port uses physical pWWN instead of virtual pWWN, that is configured through FlexAttach.
FlexAttach is supported on server interfaces like F ports, and not on external interfaces such as NP ports.
real port WWN and virtual WWN cannot be same
This occurs when you try to configure FlexAttach with a similar value for pWWN and virtual pWWN.
Use different values for pWWN and virtual pWWN, as similar values for pWWN and virtual pWWn are not allowed.
Virtual port WWN already exists
This occurs when you try to configure an already defined pWWN to a different interface.
Use an undefined virtual pWWN for a new interface.

FlexAttach Errors and Workarounds
Security Settings for FlexAttach Virtual pWWN
Security settings for the FlexAttach virtual pWWN feature are done by port security at the NPV core. Node WWN of the end device is used to provide physical security.
For more details on enabling port security, refer to the Cisco MDS 9000 Family NX-OS Security Configuration Guide.
FlexAttach Virtual pWWN CFS Distribution
The FlexAttach virtual pWWN configuration is distributed for CFS through IPv4, and is enabled by default. The FlexAttach virtual pWWN distribution, by default, is on CFS region 201. The CFS region 201 links only to the NPV-enabled switches. Other CFS features such as syslog is on region 0. Region 0 will be linked through IPv4 for all NPV switches on the same physical fabric. If CFS has an option to link through IPv4 or ISL, then CFS will select the ISL path.
Note NPV switches do not have ISL (E or TE ports) and are linked through IPv4.
Using the Server Admin FlexAttach Wizards
As in Fabric Manager Release 4.1(1) and later, the Server Admin perspective view of the Fabric Manager GUI provides the following FlexAttach wizards, which the Fabric Manager users with server-admin role can use to configure FlexAttach:
•Pre-Configuring FlexAttach for a New Server
•Moving a Server to Another Port or Switch
•Replacing a Server with Another Server
To access the FlexAttach wizards, follow these steps:
Step 1 Log in to Fabric Manager with a username and password that has the server-admin role assigned.
Step 2 Discover and open the fabric on which you want to configure FlexAttach.
Step 3 In the Fabric Manager window displayed, select Tools > FlexAttach to display the list of wizards. (Figure 10-8).
Figure 10-8 FlexAttach Wizards Menu Bar
Pre-Configuring FlexAttach for a New Server
Using the Pre-configure Server wizard, you can configure FlexAttach for servers that are not physically available currently. FlexAttach can be enabled on the ports designated for the new servers and can use the virtual WWNs assigned for configuring SAN. When the new servers are available, the servers can then be plugged into the fabric without any change needed in the SAN.
The Pre-Configure Server wizard can be used to accomplish the following tasks:
•Pre-Configuring FlexAttach for All the Ports
•Pre-Configuring FlexAttach for Each Port Individually
Pre-Configuring FlexAttach for All the Ports
Using the Pre-Configure Server Basic configuration wizard, you can set the following port configurations for all the ports in one or more switches in common:
–Enable or disable FlexAttach Auto on all ports
–Set the default VSAN ID for all the ports
–Set the interface status for all the ports.
To pre-configure a common setting for all the ports in one or more switches, follow these steps:
Step 1 In the Fabric Manger window, select Tools > FlexAttach > Pre-configure Server.
The Pre-Configure Wizard is displayed. (Figure 10-9)
Figure 10-9 Pre-Configure Server Wizard
Step 2 In the Pre-Configure Server window, click the Basic radio button to configure a common setting to all the ports on one or more switches.
The Basic Configuration window is displayed. (Figure 10-10)

Figure 10-11 Pre-Configure Server - Finish
Pre-Configuring FlexAttach for Each Port Individually
Using the Pre-Configure Server Advanced configuration wizard, you can set the following port configurations for each port in one or more switches individually:
–Enable FlexAttach Auto on all ports.
–Enable FlexAttach Auto or Manual on individual ports.
–Set the virtual PWWN for ports where FlexAttach is enabled Manually.
–Set pWWN to vPWWN mapping.
–Set the default VSAN ID for each port.
–Set the Interface status for each port.
To pre-configure FlexAttach on each port individually, follow these steps:
Step 1 In the Fabric Manger window, select Tools > FlexAttach > Pre-configure Server.
The Pre-Configure Server window is displayed. (Figure 10-9)

Step 3 In the Interface tab, click to select a switch from the list of switches displayed in the left pane.
The switch configuration details are displayed in the right pane with tabs and columns.
Step 4 Configure the following settings, for each interface:
•In the Status column corresponding to the interface, double-click and then select up or down from the drop-down list.
•In the VSAN column corresponding to the interface, double-click and then select the VSAN ID from the drop-down list of existing VSAN IDs.
•In the Auto column corresponding to the interface, double-click and then select Auto to automatically enable FlexAttach or select Manual to manually enable FlexAttach later.
–In the Interface vPWWN cell, enter the vPWWN if Manual was selected in the Auto FlexAttach configuration cell.
Note You can click Set All Auto to change all the interfaces with manual FlexAttach configuration to Auto on the selected switch. However, if a valid vPWWN value is already configured, then changing it to Auto does not change the configuration. Before you change from Manual to Auto, update the Interface vPWWN column with the 00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00 value.
Step 5 Repeat Step 3 through Step 4 for each switch.
Step 6 Click the PWWN to vPWWN tab to configure pWWN to vPWWN mapping.
The Advanced Configuration window is displayed. (Figure 10-13)
Figure 10-13 Pre-Configure Server - PWWN to vPWWN Configuration
Step 7 From the Select Switch drop-down list, select the switch to display the existing pWWN to Virtual PWWN mapping table for the CFS region to which the switch belongs, and then follow these steps to add vPWWN to vPWWN automap entries:
a. Click Add Row to display the PWWN to vPWWN dialog box.
b. Enter the pWWN and the corresponding virtual pWWN.
c. Click Create to add the mapping list.
Note To delete an existing mapping, select the row, and then click Delete Row. Only one pWWN to vPWWN table can be updated at a time. To update the table for each CFS region, perform
Step 6 though Step 8 for a switch from each CFS region.
Step 8 Click Finish to complete the configurations for each port.
Moving a Server to Another Port or Switch
Using the Move Server wizard, you can move a server to another port on the same NPV device or another NPV device without changing the SAN. This is accomplished by moving the virtual pWWN to the new port. No change is needed if FlexAttach was configured using the physical port WWN of the server to the virtual port WWN mapping.
To move a server to a different port in the same switch, or in a different switch, follow these steps:
Step 1 In the Fabric Manger window, select Tools > FlexAttach > Move Server.
The Move Server wizard is displayed. (Figure 10-14)

Step 10 Click Finish.
Replacing a Server with Another Server
You can use the Replace Server wizard to accomplish the following tasks:
•Replace a failed server with a new server onto the same port without changing the SAN. The new server gets the same virtual pWWN as the failed server because the virtual pWWN is assigned to the port.
•Replace a server with a spare server on the same NPV device or a different NPV device, which can be brought online without changes to the SAN. This is achieved by moving the virtual port WWN from the current server port to the spare port.
