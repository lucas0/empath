"I strongly believe that it is the best option that is out there. We have used competitors and they are just not as strong. Some are close but most are not. We like the simplicity that this offers. The face-to-face meetings are so simple to set up. Screen sharing and control are good to have too."

Changing lives through education
"Webex is great for one-on-one meetings. With Webex Teams, the meeting continues. We can build groups for projects and load our documents there. Students love that because they have something they can review; they can share."
