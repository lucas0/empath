Introduction
This document describes the steps required to configure external two-factor authentication for Identity Services Engine (ISE) management access. In this example, the ISE administrator authenticates against the RADIUS token server and an additional authentication in the form of push notification is sent by Duo Authentication Proxy server to the administrator's mobile device.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:
RADIUS Protocol
Configuring ISE RADIUS Token server and identities
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
Identity Services Engine (ISE)
Active Directory (AD)
Duo Authentication Proxy Server
Duo Cloud Service
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.

Configuration
Duo Configuration
Step 1. Download and Install Duo Authentication Proxy Server on a Windows or linux machine: https://duo.com/docs/ciscoise-radius#install-the-duo-authentication-proxy
Note: This machine must have access to  the ISE and Duo Cloud (Internet)
Step 2. Configure the authproxy.cfg file.
Open this file in a text editor such as Notepad++ or WordPad.
Note: The default location is found at C:\Program Files (x86)\Duo Security Authentication Proxy\conf\authproxy.cfg
 Step3.  Create a "Cisco ISE RADIUS" application in the Duo Admin Panel: https://duo.com/docs/ciscoise-radius#first-steps
 Step4.  Edit the authproxy.cfg file and add this configuration.
        ikey= xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
        skey= xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
        api_host=api-xxxxxxxx.duosecurity.com
        radius_ip_1=10.127.196.189                    Sample IP address of the ISE server
        radius_secret_1=******
        failmode=secure
        client=ad_client
        port=1812
Step5. Configure ad_client with your Active Directory details. Duo Auth Proxy uses the below information to authenticate against AD for the primary authentication.
        [ad_client]
        host=10.127.196.230                           Sample IP address of the Active Directory
        service_account_username=< AD-username >
        service_account_password=< AD-password >
        search_dn=CN=Users,DC=gce,DC=iselab,DC=local
Note: If your network requires HTTP proxy connection for internet access, add http_proxy details in authproxy.cfg.
Step6. Restart the Duo Security Authentication Proxy Service. Save the file and Restart the Duo service on the windows machine.Open the Windows Services console (services.msc), locate Duo Security Authentication Proxy Service in the list of services, and click Restart as shown in the image:
Step7. Create a username and activate Duo Mobile on the end device: https://duo.com/docs/administration-users#creating-users-manually
Add user on Duo Admin Panel. Navigate to Users > add users, as shown in the image:
Ensure the end user has the Duo app installed on the phone.
Select Activate Duo Mobile, as shown in the image: 
Select Generate Duo Mobile Activation Code, as shown in the image: 
Select Send Instructions by SMS, as shown in the image: 
Click the link in the SMS, and Duo app gets linked to the user account in the Device Info section, as shown in the image:
ISE Configuration
Step1. Integrate ISE with Duo Auth Proxy.
Navigate to Administration > Identity Management > External Identity Sources > RADIUS Token, click Add to add a new RADIUS Token server. Define server name in general tab, IP address and shared key in connection tab, as shown in the image:
Note: Set Server Timeout as 60 seconds so that users have enough time to act on the push
Step2. Navigate to Administration > System > Admin Access > Authentication > Authentication Method and Select previously configured RADIUS token server as the Identity Source, as shown in the image:
Step3. Navigate to Administration > System > Admin Access > Administrators > Admin Users and Create an admin user as External  and provide super admin privilege, as shown in the image:
Verify
Use this section in order to confirm that your configuration works properly.
Open the ISE GUI, select RADIUS Token Server as Identity Source and login with admin user.
Troubleshoot
This section provides information you can use in order to troubleshoot your configuration.
To troubleshoot issues related to Duo proxy connectivity with Cloud or Active Directory, enable debug on Duo Auth Proxy by adding "debug=true" under main section of authproxy.cfg.
The logs are located under the following location:
     C:\Program Files (x86)\Duo Security Authentication Proxy\log
     Open the file authproxy.log in a text editor such as Notepad++ or WordPad.
