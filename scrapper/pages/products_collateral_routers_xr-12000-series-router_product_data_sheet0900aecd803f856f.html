Data Sheet
For service providers who need to cost-effectively scale their Ethernet IP infrastructures in response to growing high-bandwidth and service demands, the Cisco® XR 12000 and 12000 Series Gigabit Ethernet line cards deliver a comprehensive range of features that enable Layer 2 and Layer 3 Ethernet edge applications such as Metro Ethernet aggregation, peering, and Cisco IPv6 services without compromising performance. The advanced features include industry-leading quality of service (QoS), which is ideal for customer service-level agreements (SLAs); packet filtering and Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF); rate limiting to help ensure that all customers are served according to the SLAs; a comprehensive set of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) features for high-level services to customers; and Ethernet features such as VLANs, source and destination MAC accounting, and jumbo frames.
The Cisco XR 12000 and 12000 Series 4-Port Gigabit Ethernet ISE Line Card (4-port GE ISE card) offers four physical ports that support three types of Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP) transceivers (Figure 1).
The Cisco 12000 Series Modular Gigabit Ethernet Line Card offers a baseboard with one fixed Gigabit Ethernet port and the flexibility to configure up to three 3-port Gigabit Ethernet port adapters (EPAs) (Figure 2).
The transceivers are all hot-swappable and 802.3z-compliant, and they operate in full-duplex mode. Each of the Gigabit Ethernet interfaces can be configured with:
• 1000BASE-SX-850-nanometer (nm) serial, multimode fiber for 550-meter (m) transmission
• 1000BASE-LH-1310-nm serial, single-mode fiber for 10-kilometer (km) transmission
• 1000BASE-ZX-1550-nm serial, single-mode fiber for 70-km transmission

The Cisco 12000 Series 1-Port 10-Gigabit Ethernet Line Card provides one dedicated 10-Gigabit Ethernet port that offers 10-Gigabits-per-second (Gbps) line-rate performance for IP and MPLS traffic (Figure 3).
