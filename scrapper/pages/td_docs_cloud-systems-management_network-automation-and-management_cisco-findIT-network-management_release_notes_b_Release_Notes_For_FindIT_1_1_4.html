Introduction
These release notes describe the recommended practices and known issues that apply to software version 1.1.4 of Cisco FindIT Network Manager and Cisco FindIT Network Probe.
What's New in the Cisco FindIT 1.1.4 VM Images, build date 20190701
The original FindIT Network Manager & Probe version 1.1.4 virtual machine images have been updated to address the following caveats:
CSCvq35115—VM operating system subject to TCP DoS issues
CSCvo93538—Cisco FindIT Network Management Software Static Credentials Vulnerability
There is no change to the FindIT application version included within the virtual machine image. If you have an existing installation deployed using a previous version of the virtual machine images, then consult the caveat details for the steps required to fully resolve the issues on an existing virtual machine. You may check the virtual machine image build date using the following command:
cisco@findit-manager:~$ grep -A 1 "OS Build Date" /etc/cisco-vm-version

What's New in Cisco FindIT, Release 1.1.4
Cisco FindIT Network Probe version 1.1.4 adds support for the RV160x and RV260x router platforms
When remotely accessing a device web UI through FindIT Network Manager, the TLS session will terminate on the Manager and a new TLS session extended from the Manager to the device. This results in an encrypted session between the web browser and the Manager even when the device only supports HTTP. Also, the web browser will be presented with the Manager certificate for all connections through the Manager, not just connections to the Manager and Probe GUIs.
