CSCwe46076 CTI channel not recreated after Xsi-Events application revert/upgrade causing missed notifications
Problem Description
The Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) channel is not recreated after the Xsi-Events applications are reverted or upgraded, which causes missed notifications.
Background
When you upgrade or revert an Xsi-Events application (Xsi-Events-23, Xsi-Events-24 or Xsi-Events-25) on the Application Delivery Platform (ADP) without an upgrade or restart of the ADP afterwards, any previously established CTI connection stays alive without notification that the underlying System Channel is no longer valid.
This causes client applications that use the CTI connection to no longer receive notifications, which includes presence and call history used by Webex for BroadWorks. This issue affects all integrations that use CTI, not only Webex for BroadWorks.
Problem Symptom
The impact of this issue is that client applications that use CTI and expect notifications will no longer receive notifications over a CTI connection established prior to upgrading or reverting the Xsi-Events application.
Workaround/Solution
Workaround
Restart BroadWorks on the ADP after you upgrade or revert the Xsi-Events application.
As the Application Server (AS) is upgraded while locked, and unlocked after starting, the AS should be restarted while unlocked in order to ensure that the System Channels are re-established properly on the unlocked AS.
