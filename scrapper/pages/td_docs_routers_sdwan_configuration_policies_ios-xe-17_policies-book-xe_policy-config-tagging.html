Description
Support for Cisco SD-WAN Policy Configuration Tagging Using the Cisco vSmart Controller CLI Template
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.9.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1
This feature allows you to group multiple policy objects under a tag. The tag mechanism, when used in Cisco SD-WAN centralized or localized policies, provides the following functionalities:
Controls the download speed of a policy between the Cisco vSmart Controller and the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
Improves management of defined lists in the Cisco vSmart Controller.
Better organizes the configurations of the intent-based network.

Restrictions for Policy Configuration Tagging
Only data-prefix-lists, data-ipv6-prefix-lists, and app-lists tag members are supported.
Configuration of both direction and direction-less tags within the same TAG is not supported.
Configuration of tags using only Cisco vSmart controller CLI templates is supported.
Multi-tenancy is not supported.
Configuration of number of tags is limited to maximum of 255.
Configuration of objects per tag is limited to 64.
Information About Policy Configuration Tagging
The policy configuration tagging feature allows you to group policy objects and to assign tag values to various traffic flows by defining a policy. You can name the tags based on the functionality of the policy objects used to achieve the intent-based network configurations. These tags that are provisioned through the Cisco vSmart controller are used in the policy rules for traffic classification.
You can assign unique tag IDs while creating each of the tags.
You can define members under a tag name, which are referenced directly under tag objects. The members can be directional or directionless. Supported tag member types are:
Data-prefix-list
Data-ipv6-prefix-list
App-list
Data-prefix-list and data-ipv6-prefix-list are directional attributes, which are matched as source or destination keywords in the data-policy match statements. App-list is a directionless attribute. You can use directionless keyword such as application id in the app-list policy match statements. Directional and directionless attributes cannot be grouped under the same tag.
You can apply the configured tags in a match criterion under localized and centralized policies. Devices process the tag configurations and apply the configurations to the data plane when the tag is referenced in the policy.
You can use the configuration type feature to tag objects in a configuration. The configuration tags are used in Cisco SD-WAN centralized policy such as data policy, and app-aware routing policy and localized access-list policy. The following tag attributes are used in a policy match sequence statement:
Source-tag-instance
Destination-tag-instance
Tag-instance
Figure 1. Policy Configuration Tagging in a Cisco SD-WAN Network
As shown in the figure, at the Cisco vSmart controller you can configure the tags using the policy objects with unique tag IDs. Once the tag IDs are assigned these tags are pushed to the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices in the network, which reference these tags. The devices then extract the policy list objects from the tags, which are used in the policy rules.
Features of Policy Configuration Tagging
Supports only configuration type tag.
Supports tagging a group of objects configuration.
Supported tag members are data-prefix-lists, data-ipv6-prefix-lists, and app-lists.
Supports defining configuration tags through a tag-centric model called Defined Tag.
Supports adding configuration only through Cisco vSmart controller CLI templates from Cisco vManage.
Tag Workflow
In Cisco vSmart controller, create a tag that is based on the network intent.
Add the following policy list object members:
Data-prefix for each location
App-lists for applications
The policy list objects can be defined anytime in the workflow, even after adding them in the tag instances.
Push these tags to the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices in the network.
Create a policy with multiple match sequences and include the tag objects in the Cisco SD-WAN data-policy, app-aware-routing policy, and access-list policy.
If you add or remove a tag, the status is automatically reflected in the policy.
Update the policy to include new tag objects.
Figure 2. Tagging Workflow with Examples
Benefits of Policy Configuration Tagging
The benefits of using policy configuration tagging are:
Enables reusability of policy objects.
Enables faster policy download on a device with reduced configuration size and sequences.
Tag sharing across different policies is supported.
Enables visibility or corelation across the network in a user-defined intent.
Controls the policy configuration download speed between the Cisco vSmart controller and the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
Improves management of the defined lists in the controller.
Better organization of the configurations for the intent-based network.
Configure Policy Configuration Tagging Using a CLI Template
Before You Begin
Ensure that the controllers and the edge devices are all updated to the latest versionsâ€”Cisco SD-WAN Controllers Release 20.9.x, Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1, and Cisco IOS XE Release 17.9.1a.
Configure Policy Configuration Tagging Using a CLI Template
For more information about using CLI templates, see CLI Add-On Feature Templates and CLI Templates.

Note
By default, CLI templates execute commands in global config mode.
This section provides example CLI configurations to configure tag-instances and centralized policy using Cisco vSmart controller CLI templates.
Creating Policy Configuration Tagging
Configure a new object tag-instance on Cisco vSmart controller:
tag-instances [tag-instance] [lists] 
Create tag-instance with member attributes such as app-lists, data-ipv6-prefix-list, and data-prefix-list. Configure tag instances with a global unique ID for each of the tag names. The tag configuration is pushed to only those devices which reference these TAGs:
tag-instance tag-instance-name [id global-unique-id][app-list app-list-name] [data-prefix-list prefix-list-name] [data-ipv6-prefix-list ipv6-prefix-list-name] 
Configure tag-instance lists:
lists[app-list app-list-name] [data-prefix-list prefix-list-name] [data-ipv6-prefix-list ipv6-prefix-list-name] 
Adding Tag-Instances in a policy match criteria
Configure localized access-list policy (ACLs and IPv6 ACLs) to include destination or source tag instances in matching attributes:
match [destination-tag-instance dest-tag-name | source-tag-instance src-tag-name] 
Configure centralized data policy to include destination-tag-instance, source-tag-instance, or tag-instance in matching attributes:
match [destination-tag-instance dest-tag-name | source-tag-instance  src-tag-name | tag-instance  tag-name] 
Configure centralized Application Aware Route (AAR) policy to include destination-tag-instance, source-tag-instance, or tag-instance in matching attributes:
match[destination-tag-instance dest-tag-name | source-tag-instance src-tag-name | tag-instance  tag-name] 
Here's the complete configuration example for creating tag-instances, including the tag instances as matching attribute in localized and centralized policies:
