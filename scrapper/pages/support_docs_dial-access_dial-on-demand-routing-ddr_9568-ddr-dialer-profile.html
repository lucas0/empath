Introduction
Dial-on-Demand Routing (DDR) addresses the need for intermittent network connections over circuit-switched WANs. There are two main methods to configure DDR: legacy DDR and dialer profiles. This document addresses dialer profiles. For information on configuring legacy DDR, please refer to these resources:

Configuring BRI-to-BRI Dialup with DDR Dialer Maps
Prerequisites
Requirements
We strongly recommend that you read the document Configuring and Troubleshooting Dialer Profiles before you configure dialer profiles.
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions.
Cisco 2503 with Cisco IOSÂ® Software Release Version 12.2(10b)
Cisco 2503 with Cisco IOS Software Release Version 12.2(10b)
Cisco 2520 with Cisco IOS Software Release Version 12.2(10b)
The information presented in this document was created from devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If you work in a live network, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command before you use it.
Background Theory
Dialer profiles separate logical configurations from the physical interfaces that receive or make calls. Because of this separation, multiple dialer profile configurations can share interfaces such as ISDN, asynchronous modems, or synchronous serial connections. Dialer profiles allow you to bind logical and physical configurations together dynamically on a per call basis. This allows physical interfaces to take on different characteristics based on incoming or outgoing call requirements. Dialer profiles can define encapsulation, access control lists, minimum or maximum calls, and toggle features on or off. Dialer profiles are particularly useful where multiple ISDN B channels are to be used to connect to multiple remote destinations simultaneously. In such a case, one dialer profile can be bound to one set of B channels while another dialer profile can be bound to another set of B channels. This allows the same physical interface to connect to multiple remote destinations simultaneously.
The components of a dialer profile include:
Dialer interfaces - logical entities that use a per-destination dialer profile. You can create any number of dialer interfaces in a router. All configuration settings specific to the destination go in the dialer interface configuration. Each dialer interface uses a dialer pool, which is a pool of physical interfaces (ISDN BRI and PRI, asynchronous-modem, and synchronous serial).
Dialer pool - Each interface references a dialer pool, which is a group of physical interfaces associated with a dialer profile. A physical interface can belong to multiple dialer pools. Contention for a specific physical interface is resolved by configuring the optional priority command.
Physical interfaces - Interfaces in a dialer pool are configured for encapsulation parameters. The interfaces are also configured to identify the dialer pools to which the interface belong. Dialer profiles support PPP and High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) encapsulation.
Dialer map-class (optional) - Supply configuration parameters to dialer interfaces (for example, ISDN speed, dialer timers parameters, and so on). A map-class can be referenced from multiple dialer interfaces.
For more information on Dialer Profiles, and to determine whether Dialer Profiles are appropriate for your situation, refer to the document Configuring and Troubleshooting Dialer Profiles.

Tuning and Optional Commands
For more information on DDR commands, refer to the Peer-to-Peer DDR with Dialer Profiles Commands documentation.
Here is a list of optional timer commands:
dialer idle-timeout seconds - Specifies the idle timer value to use for the call. This timer disconnects the call if no interesting traffic has been transmitted for the specified time. The default is 120 seconds.
dialer fast-idle seconds - Specifies a quick disconnect time if there is another call waiting for the same interface and the interface is idle. The waiting call does not have to wait for the idle timer to expire. The default is 20 seconds.
dialer wait-for-carrier-time seconds - Specifies the time for the carrier time value to use for the call. If no carrier is detected within the specified time, the call is abandoned.
Following is a list of optional map class commands:
map-class dialer class-name - Specifies a map class and enters map class configuration mode. The map-class configuration is linked to a dialer profile with the dialer string # class class-name command applied on the interface dialer mode. The following commands are available in the map class configuration mode:
dialer idle-timeout sec , dialer fast-idle sec , dialer wait-for-carrier-time sec (refer to the Timers section).
dialer isdn [speed speed ] [spc] - Specifies the ISDN line speed (64kbps is the default). The spc option is used to specify an ISDN semi-permanent connection.
Following is a list of optional multilink PPP commands:
ppp multilink - Specifies that this dialer interface uses multilink PPP (fragments packets over a bundle of interfaces connected to the same destination). This command is placed on the physical interface for incoming calls and in the dialer interface for outgoing calls.
dialer load-threshold load [outbound | inbound | either] - Specifies at what traffic load additional links will be brought up for multilink PPP. Valid values are from 1 to 255 (255 is 100 percent of link utilization).
Here is a list of other commands you can use:
dialer hold-queue packets - Specifies the length of the queue for packets waiting for the line to come up. Valid values are from 0 to 100.
dialer pool-member number [priority priority] [min-link minimum] [max link maximum] - Assigns a physical interface to a dialer pool.
priority priority - Sets the priority of the physical interface within the dialer pool (from 1 to 255). Interfaces with the highest priorities are selected first when dialing out.
min-link minimum - Sets the minimum number of ISDN B channels on an interface reserved for this dialer pool (from 1 to 255). Used for dialer backup.
max-link maximum - Sets the maximum number of ISDN B channels on an interface reserved for this dialer pool (from 1 to 255).
dialer-list dialer-group protocol protocol-name {permit | deny | list access-list-number} - Global configuration command used to define interesting traffic that will start a DDR connection. This command is linked to the dialer-group number interface command.
permit - Permits access to an entire protocol.
deny - Denies access to an entire protocol.
list - Specifies an access list to be used for defining a granularity finer than an entire protocol.
Verify
This section provides information you can use to confirm your configuration works properly.
Certain show commands are supported by the Output Interpreter Tool (registered customers only) , which allows you to view an analysis of show command output.
show dialer [interface type number] - Displays general diagnostic information for interfaces configured for DDR. If the dialer came up properly, the Dialer state is data link layer up message should appear. If physical layer up appears, then the line protocol came up, but the Network Control Protocol (NCP) did not. The Dial reason line shows the source and destination addresses of the packet that initiated the dialing. This show command also displays the timer's configuration and the time before the connection times out.
show isdn status - Ensure that the router is properly communicating with the ISDN switch. In the output, verify that Layer 1 Status is ACTIVE, and that the Layer 2 Status state = MULTIPLE_FRAME_ESTABLISHED appears. This command also displays the number of active calls.
Troubleshoot
This section provides information you can use to troubleshoot your configuration.
Troubleshooting Commands
Certain show commands are supported by the Output Interpreter Tool (registered customers only) , which allows you to view an analysis of show command output.
Note: Before issuing debug commands, please see Important Information on Debug Commands.
debug isdn q931 - Shows call setup and tear down of the ISDN network connection (Layer 3).
debug isdn q921 - Shows data link layer messages (Layer 2) on the D channel between the router and the ISDN switch. Use this debug if the show isdn status command does not display Layer 1 and Layer 2 up.
debug dialer [events | packets] - Displays DDR debugging information about the packets received on a dialer interface.
debug ppp negotiation - Displays information on PPP traffic and exchanges while negotiating the PPP components including Link Control Protocol (LCP), authentication, and NCP. A successful PPP negotiation first opens the LCP state, then authenticates, and finally negotiates NCP.
debug ppp authentication - Displays the PPP authentication protocol messages, including Challenge Authentication Protocol (CHAP) packet exchanges and Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) exchanges.
debug ppp error - Displays protocol errors and error statistics associated with PPP connection negotiation and operation.

This configuration demonstrates how you can dynamically bind logical entities called dialer profiles to physical interfaces on a per call basis. By using dialer profiles, the network is able to connect to remote locations with greater flexibility. Additionally, you can use dialer profiles to better utilize available resources. You can therefore use dialer profiles to overcome many of the shortcomings of legacy DDR.
