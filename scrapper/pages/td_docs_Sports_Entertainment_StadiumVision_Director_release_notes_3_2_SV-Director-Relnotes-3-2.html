  The playlist is populated with existing content in Cisco StadiumVision Director, and you are alerted to any missing content in the playlist by a red box around the external playlist icon on the Content screen. The missing content item is identified with a question mark. Once you import any missing content, it is automatically linked to the external playlist.
Current proof of play reporting is fully supported for external playlist sources and PoP tags are automatically created for specified sponsor IDs. Any missing content is not included in the PoP report.
POS API
Beginning in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2, an API is introduced to support integration of Point of Sale (POS) vendor data for use in the External Content Integration feature. This method of POS data integration provides a more flexible way of creating and updating menu boards using the Widgets tool independent of the legacy DMB application.
The DMB application currently supports a more tightly-coupled integration with Micros and Quest POS vendors that allows for dynamic content updates along with support of in-suite ordering capabilities. The POS API does not support in-suite ordering, but would allow for more open integration of POS data from other POS vendors that can conform to the XML schema supported by Cisco StadiumVision Director.
User Control API
Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2 supports the in-suite API, which allows querying as well as sending control information to Cisco StadiumVision Director.
The API supports the following areas:
Album Control
Information Retrieval
Security
TV Control
Album Control
The API album control capabilities for SSC include:
Retrieve all albums available for play on a specific player.
Retrieve common albums available for play on a one or more players.

Content Feature Enhancements
Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2 provides additional content support in the following feature areas:
Basic HTML Pass-Through Support
External Content Integration
Multiple Tag Selection for Content
Basic HTML Pass-Through Support
Beginning in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2, you can render simple HTML browser content (with some restrictions) on the Cisco DMP by including an external URL in a playlist and scheduling it in a script.
The content is not actually stored in the Cisco StadiumVision Director content repository (CMS) and any changes to the content on the external site page are dynamically updated on the DMP when the script restarts.
Restrictions
Before you use the Basic HTML Pass-Through Support, consider the following restrictions:
The URL for the HTML content must be local to the Cisco StadiumVision network or otherwise reachable by the DMP.
To be supported on the DMP, the HTML content located at the external URL cannot contain:
– Video
– Adobe Shockwave Flash
– HTML5
Be aware that very large, complex web pages could consume too much memory on the DMP and be unable to be supported.
Depending on how the web page is written, it might not appropriately scale to the template region size that you are running it in.
As web page content refreshes for changes, there might be a delay on the DMP’s TV display.
To use this feature, go to the Control Panel Content screen and click the New External Content button to open a dialog box and specify a name and enter the URL after the http:// prompt.
External Content Integration
The enhancements to the External Content Integration feature in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2 includes support for the following updates:
Data Integration Enhancements
Widgets Tool Enhancements
For more information on External Content Integration, see the Cisco StadiumVision Director External Content Integration Guide, Release 3.2.
Data Integration Enhancements
Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2 supports the following updates for Data Integration:
Introduction of the following new data source types:
– Generic Data Source — Database source type
Supports automatic translation of MySQL and SQLServer database formats to XML data in Cisco StadiumVision Director.
– Generic PoS
Allows any external POS data source that meets the XML schema requirements of the Cisco StadiumVision Director POS API to be ingested for use in the External Content Integration feature.
– Internal Database PoS
Allows POS data from stores that have been configured in Cisco StadiumVision Director to be made available as a data source to be used and modified in the Widgets tool.
– Menu Theme
Allows the default menu theme data from the Cisco StadiumVision Director DMB application to be made available as a data source so that this DMB theme content can be used and modified in the Widgets tool.
For details about the default menu themes in the DMB application, see the “Appendix A: DMB Default Menu Theme Reference” module in the Cisco StadiumVision Director Dynamic Menu Board and Stores Configuration Guide, Release 3.0 and Later Releases.
Basic authentication through username and password properties.
HTTPS URL support (for sites using signed SSL certificates).
Widgets Tool Enhancements
Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2 supports the following updates in the Widgets tool:
Font selector
Only the Arial font is available by default.
Custom fonts are made available for selection in the Widgets tool by uploading additional fonts to Cisco StadiumVision Director using the Software Manager. TrueType (.ttf) and OpenType (.otf) fonts are supported. For more information about how to install custom fonts, see the Cisco StadiumVision Director Software Installation and Upgrade Guide, Release 3.2.
List component
The List component can be used to create tables by grouping individual list components side-by-side either vertically or horizontally. The default format for the List component is a horizontal row of two cells. By changing the orientation to a vertical layout, the component becomes a single column of cells. Each component can be rendered as text or graphics.
Data Pull component
The Data Pull component is a special component that is only needed in a widget for certain data sources larger than 16 KB and whose data does not need more immediate synchronization across large numbers of (100-200) DMPs (such as for menu board data).
The Data Pull component changes how the data source is processed by Cisco StadiumVision Director by pulling the data feed and sending it to the Flash template, which overcomes the 16 KB multicast packet size normally pushed to the DMP.
For more information on the Widgets tool enhancements in Release 3.2, see the Cisco StadiumVision Director External Content Integration Guide, Release 3.2.
Multiple Tag Selection for Content
Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2 allows you to filter content by selecting multiple tags in the Control Panel Content screen.
Internationalization and Localization
Note Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2 supports internationalization and localization for the Cisco DMP 4310G only and the Cisco Unified IP Phone 7975G and IP Phone 9971.
Internationalization (i18n)
Internationalization (known as i18n) support refers to the software infrastructure that is designed to accommodate multiple language translations (localization) without requiring additional engineering changes to that software.
The Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2 software supports i18n for the following general areas of the solution:
Control Panel in Cisco StadiumVision Director
Dynamic Menu Board application
Management Dashboard in Cisco StadiumVision Director
IP Phone user interface
Software Manager
TV user interface
Localization (L10n)
Localization (known as L10n) refers to the implementation of the specific regional language translation support within a software interface that has been designed for i18n.
In Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2.0-489 English is the default language for the Cisco StadiumVision solution.
Caution A Cisco StadiumVision Director system that is using language support from Release 3.1.0-797 (SP2), will lose that support if upgraded to Release 3.2.0-489. Support for other language translations must be installed separately as they become available as Language Packs using the new Software Manager from the Cisco StadiumVision Director main menu.
Note Certain locales are not supported in Release 3.2, such as right-to-left languages.
Language Packs for Localization
Beginning in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2, you now have increased flexibility to upload and install only the specific language(s) that you want to support through the independent installation of Language Packs as they become available for the release. The upload and installation of the language packs is performed using the new Software Manager from the Cisco StadiumVision Director main menu.
In prior Cisco StadiumVision Director releases, localization upgrades included automatic installation of all supported languages bundled as part of a service pack which no longer applies to language support in Release 3.2.
For more information about how to install language packs, see the Cisco StadiumVision Director Software Installation and Upgrade Guide, Release 3.2.
Translated User Documents
Available versions of translated end-user documents for Cisco StadiumVision Director can be found at:
http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/video/stadiumvision/tsd-products-support-translated-end-user-guides-list.html
Per-Script Multicast Optimization
In Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2, the original Multicast Optimization introduced in Release 3.1 is replaced by Per-Script Multicast Optimization (for up to 20 different scripts) to reduce the number of multicast messages that each DMP must process.
Per-Script Multicast Optimization is designed to reduce the load on DMPs when the following conditions are present in Cisco StadiumVision Director:
More than one event script is run simultaneously in a venue.
The scripts can be running across multiple venues, scripts running in a single venue, or running in systems without Cisco StadiumVision Director Remote servers.
The External Content Integration feature is used, which sends multiple messages to the DMPs in a script.
Table 14 provides a summary of the two different multicast optimization features supported in Cisco StadiumVision Director.

22.If you are running more than 20 scripts, then the first 20 scripts operate using per-script multicast channels, and the additional scripts are run over the global multicast host port.
To use Per-Script Multicast Optimization in your Cisco StadiumVision venue for systems upgraded from Release 3.1, you must enable it by setting the “transport.dynamic.enable” registry key to “true” in the Management Dashboard. You also must ensure that all of the multicast port ranges for the feature and in your Cisco StadiumVision network are compatible and non-conflicting.
For more information, see the “Configuring Multicast Ports for Cisco StadiumVision Director” section in the “Configuring the Cisco StadiumVision Director Server System Settings” module of the Cisco StadiumVision Director Server Administration Guide, Release 3.2.
Playlist Synchronization Enhancement
As a series of content items transition in a playlist (such as advertisements in Region 2 of a standard 3-region L-wrap template), there will be some variance in the appearance of each content item on the DMP displays where that content is presented. Each content item will generally appear on all corresponding DMP displays within about one second of each playlist item transition.
However, the amount of time that it takes for all displays in your venue to show the same content item within a playlist might exceed a one-second duration based on the following venue conditions: Network infrastructure, number of regions on the display, number of content items in the playlist, and the playlist duration.
In Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2, the mechanism supported for sourcing clocking on the DMPs has been replaced by use of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) to improve the synchronization of playlists across multiple DMPs. Therefore, NTP must be configured on the Cisco StadiumVision Director server and the DMPs. For more information, see the “Configuring NTP on Cisco StadiumVision Servers and DMPs” topic in the “Configuring the Cisco StadiumVision Director Server Settings” module of the Cisco StadiumVision Director Server Administration Guide, Release 3.2.
Note The playlist synchronization improvement is optimal for playlists consisting of only static images, and uniform duration of content items in the playlist. Some benefits for video playlists also can be seen if the video is not looping and the actual duration of the video is used.
Using NTP does not universally solve synchronization issues. The improvement in cross-DMP synchronization has the following limitations:
The DMP clock drifts, so setting the NTP sync interval too high can cause observable deterioration of synchronization over time. Playlist synchronization then improves when the DMP updates its clock.
This feature is optimal for synchronization of static images contained in a playlist.
To benefit from playlist synchronization when video is used, use the video’s actual duration versus letting the DMP play it to completion. To do this however, seamless video looping is sacrificed.
Although the duration of a static image (or other content type) is explicitly defined, the Flash template might choose to adjust the time it shows the playlist. This adjustment in display time involves either reducing or extending the render time, but is typically in the millisecond range (subject to the constraints of the sync interval setting).
RTP and UDP Multicast Channel Feed Support
Beginning in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2, you can configure the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) option for multicast feeds on the Channels screen in Control Panel Setup (Figure 2).
Figure 2 Protocol Option on Channels Screen
  Server Administration
The following enhancement has been made for Cisco StadiumVision Director server administration:
Software Manager
Software Manager
Beginning in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2, a new method of managing software is available from the Cisco StadiumVision Director and Cisco StadiumVision Director Remote main menu. After you download the necessary files to the computer where you run the Cisco StadiumVision Director software, you can use the Software Manager to run the following types of software activity on the Cisco StadiumVision Director and remote servers:
ISO upgrades
The legacy method of performing an ISO upgrade using the Text Utility Interface (TUI) remains available in Release 3.2.
Language pack installation (Cisco StadiumVision Director only)
Language support is no longer bundled with a service pack in Release 3.2. Individual language support can be installed independently.
Custom font installation (Cisco StadiumVision Director only)
Arial is the only default font made available in the Widgets tool for the External Content Integration feature. You can install additional fonts using the Software Manager. For more information about custom font support for screen layouts, see the “Widgets Tool Enhancements” section.
For more information about how to use the Software Manager, see the Cisco StadiumVision Director Software Installation and Upgrade Guide, Release 3.2.
TUI
In Cisco StadiumVision Director and Cisco StadiumVision Director Remote Release 3.2, the following TUI enhancements were made.
For general information about the TUI, see the “Cisco StadiumVision Director Text Utility Interface” module in the Cisco StadiumVision Director Server Administration Guide, Release 3.2.
Cisco StadiumVision Director TUI Updates in Release 3.2.0-489
In Cisco StadiumVision Director, the NTP sub-menu was added to the Troubleshooting menu, with the following options:
Local clock state
Show configured peers and clients
For more information about NTP configuration and troubleshooting, see the “Configuring the Cisco StadiumVision Director Server Settings” module in the Cisco StadiumVision Director Server Administration Guide, Release 3.2.
Cisco StadiumVision Director Remote TUI Updates in Release 3.2.0-82
The “Change admin password” option was added to the System Accounts menu.
For more information, see the “Configuring Cisco StadiumVision Director Remote Servers” module in the Cisco StadiumVision Director Server Administration Guide, Release 3.2.
User Interface
The following general areas of the Cisco StadiumVision Director user interface (UI) have been changed in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2:
Main Menu
The Manage Software option has been added.
Channel Setup Screen
Addition of UDP and RTP protocol options.
Content Screen
New External Content button added to specify the URL for a pass-through HTML content source.
Templates Screen
Template List
The template list has the following enhancements:
Templates are ordered by name.
When switching between templates, unsaved edits are no longer forced to be deleted. Unsaved templates are indicated by an *.
Deletion of a template that is being used by a script will cause a force dialog.
Template Canvas
There are alignment guides on the template canvas.
Region List
The Region list has the following enhancements:
Regions are ordered from bottom-to-top, where the top layer appears at the top of the list.
Layers are numbered, where the video region always appears at the bottom of the list (Region 1). (You can manually drag a video region to be on top of other regions; however, the rendering of the regions below the video region will not be predictable, and can be completely invisible.)
A separate button adds a video region. This button is disabled when a video region already exists.
A film icon indicates the video region.
Region Properties
Switching a non-video region to a video region might produce a warning if there is already an existing video region. The template editor will only support creation of one video region that is indicated by the film icon.
Saving an existing template with regions removed will produce a force dialog for confirmation if the regions are used by a script. Another dialog will appear after the template is saved to give a list of script(s) affected.
Note If you do not correct an affected script to use available template regions and try to edit/save the script while it still references a removed template region, you will receive the following “Error in server communication” warning dialog and the script cannot be saved.

http://www.cisco.com/cisco/software/navigator.html?mdfid=283479662&i=rm
Upgrade Process
Caution When upgrading from Release 3.1.0-797 (SP2) to Release 3.2.0-489, it is critical that all Cisco StadiumVision Director users clear their browser cache to prevent permanent database corruption and to be sure that you are running the latest version of Cisco StadiumVision Director. This defect (CSCuo71708) is fixed in Release 3.2.0-518, however after an upgrade to any Cisco StadiumVision Director version, it is always required that every user clears their browser cache.
Upgrades to Cisco StadiumVision Director and Cisco StadiumVision Director Remote software are made available using the new Software Manager once you have installed Release 3.2. For more information, see the “Software Manager” section. As an alternative, the legacy ISO upgrade utility is still available from the TUI.
For Cisco StadiumVision Director, there are two upgrade environments for Release 3.2, which have different upgrade requirements:
Upgrading an existing server from Release 3.1.0-797 Service Pack 2 to Release 3.2.
This requires you to upgrade DMP firmware and perform the ISO upgrade using the legacy ISO upgrade utility from the TUI.
Upgrading an existing server already running Release 3.2 to a more recent 3.2 release.
This environment generally requires that you only perform an ISO software upgrade. You can use the new Software Manager to perform the upgrade.
For more details about upgrading the Cisco StadiumVision Director software for your environment, see the Cisco StadiumVision Director Software Installation and Upgrade Guide, Release 3.2.
For more details about upgrading the Cisco StadiumVision Director Remote software for your environment, see the Cisco StadiumVision Director Remote Installation and Upgrade Guide, Release 3.2.
VLAN Compliance Check
A VLAN compliance check for DMPs is supported in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2. After you upgrade to release 3.2, you need to go to the Management Dashboard and change the Assigned VLAN property under Global DMP Settings for the 4310 v5.x.x settings according to your DMP VLAN configuration as follows:
If all of your DMPs are located on the same VLAN (recommended)—Type the number of the VLAN and save the configuration.
If all of your DMPs are not located on the same VLAN, or you want to bypass any VLAN compliance checking—Type “ $svd_ignore ” and save the configuration.
Note The default Assigned VLAN property value is $svd_ignore.
The value in the Assigned VLAN property in the Management Dashboard settings for the DMP 4310s is checked against the value being sent by the DMP, unless you have configured $svd_ignore.
Caution DMP auto-registration support requires that the VLAN value is correctly set or “$svd_ignore” is used.
Figure 3 shows how to configure the Assigned VLAN property under the 4310 v5.x.x Settings for DMPs that are not located on the same VLAN using the “$svd_ignore” string.
Figure 3 Assigned VLAN Property Configuration for DMPs
  Limitations and Restrictions
When using Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2, be aware of the following limitations and restrictions:
Caution Proof of play raw data repository in /var/sv/pofp/raw directory is not part of the backup process. In normal operation, a completed script with a green dot already has a copy of the raw data and is part of the backup data. No further action is needed aside from generating the PoP report. For completed scripts that do not have a green dot, it is very important to investigate or call for support within 60 days of the event, after which time the PoP messages in the raw directory will be deleted.
If you have previously accessed a different Cisco StadiumVision Director version on your computer, sometimes unexpected behavior or warnings arise, or you might access an older version of the interface. In this case, and especially after an upgrade, you must clear your browser cache.
The first release of Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2 implements the infrastructure only to support i18n and L10n to support the independent installation of other language packs with Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2 as they become available.
Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2 does not support internationalization for back-end messaging.
Non-English characters are not supported as a Cisco StadiumVision Director login credential.
Multi-user support in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2 is limited to script editing only. No other Control Panel functions for templates, zones, groups, and playlists support a multi-user environment, and these areas can be deleted by other users. However, users are notified about potential impact due to currently locked scripts and are prompted for confirmation of deletion and given an option to use instant messaging to coordinate with the script owner.
No more than 10 users can be supported at any one time in the Management Dashboard and Control Panel areas. The system does not prevent more than 10 sessions to be opened, so you need to be careful that you do not exceed this limit.
No more than 50 staging threads can be processing in Cisco StadiumVision Director at any one time. The default maximum is 10. The maximum is configured using the “stagingThreadNum” registry found under the Tools > Advanced > Registry section of the Management Dashboard.
Note If auto-registration is enabled and a new DMP is detected, then Cisco StadiumVision Director initiates staging and always uses 50 as the maximum value. In this case, the stagingThreadNum registry setting is ignored and remains unchanged.
Consider the following restrictions and expected behavior when configuring playlists:
– Single video loop—You can configure a playlist to loop continuously when you have a playlist with a single video content item set for a duration of zero, with the playlist duration also set to zero.
– Single non-video loop—You can configure a playlist to loop continuously when you have a playlist with a single non-video content item by setting the item duration to -1, and setting the playlist duration to a number greater than or equal to zero.
– All playlists will loop their content (for example, once the last item plays, the playlist restarts with the first item) unless a duration of zero is configured on the first playlist item.
– To run a playlist one time, you can specify a duration of zero for the last item in the playlist. There is different behavior if the last item is a non-video item versus a video. If the last item has zero duration, and once the rest of the playlist items run, then if the last item is a non-video item, it continuously plays for the duration of the state. If the last item is a video, the video plays one time followed by a black screen for the duration of the state.
– If a change is made to a playlist and the playlist is currently being displayed, it is possible that items in the playlist that are past an item in the playlist with a duration of zero, could get displayed and the playlist continues until the item with zero duration is reached again.
Important Notes
This section includes other important information about the Cisco StadiumVision solution that you should know for optimal operation.
DMP Maintenance Recommendations
To avoid unexpected behavior and maintain normal operation of your devices, it is highly recommended that you perform a soft reboot of all of the DMPs in your system each week. You can reboot DMPs manually or configure a periodic task to run automatically.
Note Before you perform a reboot, be sure that there are not any active scripts running.
For more information see the “ How to Configure the Reboot DMP System Task From the Management Dashboard ” task note.

CSCuo22947—Selection of region names is not possible until template is saved once.
Symptom User cannot select any of the regions on the list of regions until the template is saved at least once.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Log into Cisco StadiumVision Director and go to Control Panel > Setup > Templates.
2. Create a new template.
3. Add two or more regions.
4. Attempt to select the regions you created by clicking on the entries on the list of regions on the right.
Workaround Save the newly created template.
CSCuo21040—Database Integration PostgreSQL DB type unable to get data.
Symptom The PostgreSQL database is not retrieved.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Log into Cisco StadiumVision Director and go to Control Panel > Data Integration.
2. Create a PostgreSQL data source and save it.
3. Notice the schema is automatically picked up and displayed in the “mapping” tab.
4. Click and drag over some field mappings.
5. Deploy the data source and restart the application from the Management Dashboard.
Workaround There is no workaround.
CSCuo20599—Only a single database type can be deployed at the same time.
Symptom Two MySQL data sources stop getting data.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Log into Cisco StadiumVision Director and go to Control Panel > Data Integration.
2. Create two database data sources for MySQL databases.
3. Verify that the data sources are getting data.
4. Create a data source for SQLServer.
5. Restart the integration server.
Workaround There is no workaround.
CSCuo20587—In Database Integration when source table schema changes, the table name parameter in Cisco StadiumVision Director needs to change/saved in order for schema to update.
Symptom If the table schema changes in the source database Cisco StadiumVision Director will not automatically pick up the schema change.
Workaround For Cisco StadiumVision Director to pick up the schema change, the “Table Name” parameter for the data source has to be modified and saved. Change the table name to something else, save the change, change the table name back, then save.
CSCuo15028—Data Integration unable to retrieve data over unsigned SSL certificate.
Symptom If the HTTPS server uses an unsigned SSL certificate the data retrieval will fail.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Log into Cisco StadiumVision Director and go to Control Panel > Data Integration.
2. Create a data source for an HTTPS source.
Workaround The HTTPS server where data is being retrieved needs to have a signed SSL certificate.
CSCuo14464—Initial RS232 commands delayed by +/- 15 seconds during FlashTempl load.
Symptom The Flash template needs to be fully loaded before issuing RS-232 / RS-232 commands to a television screen attached to the DMP, or the commands may not be sent. The initial RS-232 command from Cisco StadiumVision Director to the DMP might be delayed by as much as +/- 15 seconds. Thus, if the customer creates a set of sequential states where state #1 is less than 20 seconds, the first command (i.e. "TV On") could be transmitted after the second command.
Workaround Create a blank state (120+ seconds) and set the initial RS-232 command to 20 seconds.
CSCun96085— Live content addition causes flickering effect of content on displays.
Symptom Sometimes live content addition/deletion/replacement (while a script is running) causes something like a flickering effect of the content on the displays for 30 seconds to a minute, and then it goes back to normal. The flickering effect can be described as the DMPs switching back and forth between two images in rapid succession on the display. This happens only from time to time and is not reproducible at will.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Make sure a script is running full screen non-video template that has static images as playlists, and a script state with that particular playlist is playing on the TV's.
2. Go into the playlist mentioned in Step 1 and start dragging and dropping new static images from Content tab. Select yes and Force options to the warnings so the new content is pushed while the script is running.
3. Observer the TV display to see if the flickering is happening.
Workaround There is no workaround.
CSCun79926—Channel guide can disappear (goes blank) if customer creates channel #zero.
Symptom When the customer adds a channel numbered zero, sometimes the channel guide will no longer display in Cisco StadiumVision Director Control Panel UI.
Workaround Do not create a channel with channel #0.
CSCun46754—DMB permission assignment breaks if a user with permission gets deleted.
Symptom If a non-admin user have permission to a DMB theme in liferay and that user gets deleted from the Cisco StadiumVision Director side, that particular DMB theme can never be assigned to any other users.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Log into Cisco StadiumVision Director as an administrator.
2. Click on the DMB button from the Main Menu to go to the liferay portal. Select a theme and click the manage user access button to assign the permission to a concessionaire user.
3. Sign out the as admin and login as the concessionaire user that you just assigned permission to.
4. Click on the DMB button once you login to Cisco StadiumVision Director. You can see that the concessionaire user can see and have access to the DMB from Step 2.
5. Logout and log back in as admin user.
6. Now delete the concessionaire user and create another concessionaire user.
7. Click on the DMB button to go into Liferay, still signed in as admin.
8. Assign permission of the same DMB theme to the newly created concessionaire user.
9. Repeat steps 3 & 4. You can see that this time the new concessionaire user does not have access to the DMB themes assigned to him in step 8.
In tomcat logs you will see a similar error to the following:
[Feb 27 17:25:55 -0800 2014] DEBUG admin com.cisco.service.MenuService - ownerAddOrDelete:XML from iapps: {<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?><response><success>false</success><message>No row with the given identifier exists: [com.cisco.x.orm.User#46]</message></response>}
  The deletion of user on Cisco StadiumVision Director side is not propagated to the liferay database thus making all the themes that user was associated with unassignable to any other users in the future.
Workaround Workaround is to duplicate the theme and assign permission to the duplicated theme.
CSCun34635—DMP no longer display info on screen when upgrading firmware.
Symptom For all 5.4+ firmware, the DMP no longer displays a progress bar on the screen during an upgrade. The screen is blank, making it difficult to tell if the upgrade is in process or there are possibly other DMP issues.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Using either the Management Dashboard or the DMP web UI select a different firmware than the one currently in use by the DMP.
2. Start the firmware upgrade process.
Workaround There is no workaround.
CSCun34199—DMP-4310 can be crashed by rapidly cycling through sequential states.
Symptom DMP-4310 can be crashed by rapidly cycling through states during an event. This is due to rapid-fire UI state changes, and this is not to be confused with CSCum25342 (DMP memory exhaustion in Flash template, after X number of state changes.)
The EDO will usually complain that a DMP rebooted, restarted flash, or showed a “black screen” and if this bug is responsible for it, the logs will reveal that customers experiencing this issue have been firing off a half dozen or more state changes against the same script ID anywhere from 1-15 seconds apart.
(It is OK to rapidly fire off a batch of state changes for multiple script IDs.)
This defect must not be presumed to be responsible for any support cases matching those symptoms unless there is 100% positive diagnosis from the Cisco StadiumVision Director logs as shown below.
/var/log/svd-control/sv_dev_debug.log will show multiple ChangeScriptStates occurring within 15 seconds of each other, and the scriptID (80 in this example) must match for this CDETS to apply.
  2014-02-23 17:02:22,032 [OutboundTriggerManager-ThreadPool] ccfd34db alexckho INFO com.cisco.sv.triggers.OutboundTriggerManager - Received event: triggerType=ChangeScriptState, scriptId=80, scriptName=WahHoi_poster_L_PartB, oldRunState=Running, newRunState=Running, oldScriptState=F123, newScriptState=FR2
  2014-02-23 17:02:26,608 [OutboundTriggerManager-ThreadPool] 568c1b14 alexckho INFO com.cisco.sv.triggers.OutboundTriggerManager - Received event: triggerType=ChangeScriptState, scriptId=80, scriptName=WahHoi_poster_L_PartB, oldRunState=Running, newRunState=Running, oldScriptState=FR2, newScriptState=FR1
  2014-02-23 17:02:28,915 [OutboundTriggerManager-ThreadPool] 2b2bfda8 alexckho INFO com.cisco.sv.triggers.OutboundTriggerManager - Received event: triggerType=ChangeScriptState, scriptId=80, scriptName=WahHoi_poster_L_PartB, oldRunState=Running, newRunState=Running, oldScriptState=FR1, newScriptState=R&D
Workaround Do not perform state changes in rapid succession. There should be a minimum of 60 seconds between state changes.
CSCun24272—Cisco StadiumVision username throws NPE if created with liferay service down.
Symptom Cisco StadiumVision Director username(s) created with liferay service down (or defunct) will not be able to log into the liferay service or DMB. An NPE (Null Pointer Exception) error occurs upon login because the user is created in Cisco StadiumVision Director but not in Liferay. The following error might be seen:
20:47:01,784 ERROR [UserImpl:109] com.liferay.portal.NoSuchContactException: No Contact exists with the primary key 10836
com.liferay.portal.NoSuchContactException: No Contact exists with the primary key 10836
  Attempts to recreate or reuse the username after encountering this are unsuccessful. For example, if you create a user named “myuser” and then delete the user named “myuser” in the Cisco StadiumVision Director Control Panel. The account (myuser) seems to remain in Liferay and you can find it in Control Panel > Roles > (ROLE_NAME) > Assign Members. If you recreate “myuser” in Cisco StadiumVision Director it will still be subject to NPE errors upon login to the DMB.
Workaround There is no workaround. You must create a new username.
CSCun24246—Cisco StadiumVision user with underscore in username cannot access liferay DMB.
Symptom Liferay prompts you to log in, but you cannot access anything in Liferay, you cannot log in with your Cisco StadiumVision Director username/password, and you are not prompted to agree to terms and conditions or set a security question.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Log into Cisco StadiumVision Director as an administrator.
2. Create a new user named “something_dmb” and assign the concessionaire role.
3. Log out, clear cache, and attempt to use DMB.
Note This defect also applies to admin users with underscores in the username and appears in Release 3.1.0-797 (SP2).
Workaround Do not define usernames with underscores “_” with a Dynamic Menu Board or for admin users.
CSCum70918—Accessing Cisco StadiumVision Director using a DNS name triggers double authentication.
Symptom The Cisco StadiumVision Director login page at /var/www/cgi-bin/login.cgi automatically redirects to http://$host (derived from $host = Sys::HostIP->ip;) upon login, which is a problem if the customer wants to use an internal DNS name to access Cisco StadiumVision Director.
The user is prompted to double authenticate. Once when arriving at http://, and then a second time when the login.cgi page performs a meta refresh to http://$host (IP address) after successfully logging in. In SR 628894557, the customer has requested for this redirect to be aware of the actual URL requested in the session.
Additionally this second login prompt can be circumvented by repasting http:// into the browser, and if this occurs, that instance of login.cgi and a child process " (curl -fb JSESSIONID=$JSESSIONID http://127.0.0.1:8080/StadiumVision/springmvc/getApplConfiguration.do 2> /dev/null | grep userRole | xargs echo) " never closes. If you bypass login.cgi several times in this fashion the Cisco StadiumVision Director login page will become unresponsive.
Workaround There is no workaround.
CSCud12361—SV: Multiple DMP's lock up (reboot needed) after packet loss.
Symptom Cisco DMP 4310s seem not to recover after DCM failover has been performed (sometimes 2-3 failovers are needed, causing some packet loss). The DMP keeps showing video issues (blocking/freezing) after the packet loss/bursty traffic, and it does not recover from it.
Workaround Go to Management Dashboard > SV Director Configuration > System Configuration > Global DMP Settings > 4310 v5.x.x Settings. Change the init.PacketLossContinuty property value from 0 to 1.
