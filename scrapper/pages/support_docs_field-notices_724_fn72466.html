Defect ID Headline
CSCvz97194 WMI Providers Not Working after Windows DCOM Server Hardening for CVE-2021-26414
Problem Description
Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) Passive Identity (Passive ID) services that use the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) provider will fail after Windows Server KB500442 or later is installed.
Background
The Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) Remote Protocol is a protocol that is used in communication between the ISE Primary Passive ID node and the Domain Controller that shares the authentication events with ISE. Hardening changes in DCOM through Windows Server KB500442 or later were required to address vulnerability CVE-2021-26414. After the vulnerability is fixed, ISE will lack permissions to fetch the specific Kerberos events that are necessary for Passive ID services when the WMI provider is used.
Problem Symptom
After any Windows Server update that contains the fix for CVE-2021-26414 is installed, Passive ID services that use the WMI provider will fail. The domain controller side will display an error message similar to this:
Next error: “The server-side authentication level policy does not allow the user DOMAIN\username SID (S-X-X-X-X-X-X-X) from address xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx to activate DCOM server. Please raise the activation authentication level at least to RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_INTEGRITY in client application”
Workaround/Solution
In order to resolve this issue, Cisco recommends to migrate Passive ID connections that use the WMI provider to EVT-based PIC Agent. EVT-based PIC Agent is available in ISE Release 3.0 and later.
For instructions on how to configure EVT-based PIC Agent, see Configure EVT-Based Identity Services Engine Passive ID Agent.
Additionally, PIC Agent for ISE 2.7 and earlier will continue to work if installed on a domain controller.
If EasyConnect is in use, ISE needs to be patched to support EasyConnect with PIC Agent. If not patched, ISE only supports EasyConnect with the WMI provider. Contact the Technical Assistance Center (TAC) for hot patches for these releases:
ISE 3.0 Patch 7
ISE 3.1 Patch 5
ISE 3.2 Patch 1
For these releases, EasyConnect with PIC Agent will be supported without the need for hot patches and to contact TAC:
ISE 3.0 Patch 8
ISE 3.1 Patch 6
ISE 3.2 Patch 2
ISE 3.3
In order to detect EasyConnect use cases, choose Policy > Policy Sets and inspect each authorization policy in each policy set for these conditions:
