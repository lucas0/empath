Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCwb15715 MPP/Enterprise Phones and ATA: Shipping with MIC certificate issued by new Cisco Manufacturing CA
Problem Description
Multiplatform Phones (MPPs), Analog Telephone Adapters (ATAs), and Enterprise Phones will fail to operate if a new Certificate Authority (CA) is not added in the server trust list. Newly manufactured MPPs, ATAs, and Enterprise Phones will ship with a Cisco Manufacturing CA III or Cisco Manufacturing HA SUDI CA issued device certificate. If the new CA is not added in the server trust list, secure network deployment will fail to operate.
Background
If the new CA is not added in the server trust list, secure network deployment will fail to operate. An administrator must install the new CA in order to ensure secure device communication and operation.
This field notice lists the base Product IDs (PIDs), but pertains to all PIDs of the same model. See the Products Affected section for further details.
Problem Symptom
Secure network deployment will fail to operate on affected MPP and Enterprise devices.
Workaround/Solution
An administrator must install the new CA information in order to ensure secure device communication and operation.
For the affected MPP, ATA, and Enterprise Phone, service providers and administrators need to add the necessary files, based on the device type, to the trusted root certificate bundle they use to validate the phones' device certificate against.
MPP and ATA
The certificate (CER) and Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) file links are included here:
Cisco Manufacturing CA III (cmca3) - CER / Cisco Manufacturing CA III (cmca3) - PEM
Cisco Basic Assurance Root CA 2099 (cbarc2099) - CER / Cisco Basic Assurance Root CA 2099 (cbarc2099) - PEM
Cisco Manufacturing HA SUDI CA - CER / Cisco Manufacturing HA SUDI CA - PEM
Cisco Root CA 2099 (crca2099) - CER / Cisco Root CA 2099 (crca2099) - PEM
Enterprise Phone
The CER and PEM file links are included here:
Cisco Manufacturing CA III (cmca3) - CER / Cisco Manufacturing CA III (cmca3) - PEM 
Cisco Basic Assurance Root CA 2099 (cbarc2099) - CER / Cisco Basic Assurance Root CA 2099 (cbarc2099) - PEM
For the Cisco Unified Communictions Manager (UCM) version equal to or later than 11.5 SU9, 12.5 SU4, and 14, the new CA is natively installed, therefore it will not be affected. For the process of CA installation on Cisco UCM and Identity Services Engine (ISE), refer to:
Administration Guide for Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Release 12.5(1) - Upload the Certificate or Certificate Chain
Import and Export Certificates in ISE - Import the Certificate in ISE
