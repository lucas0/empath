Next-generation double-data-rate 4 (DDR4) memory, 12-Gbps SAS throughput, and NVMe PCIe SSD support
Innovative Cisco UCS virtual interface card (VIC) support in PCIe or modular LAN-on-motherboard (mLOM) form factor
Graphics-rich experiences to more virtual users with support for the latest NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPUs)
The UCS C240 M4 server also offers maximum reliability, availability, and serviceability (RAS) features, including:
Tool-free CPU insertion
Easy-to-use latching lid
Hot-swappable and hot-pluggable components
Redundant Cisco Flexible Flash SD cards
The Cisco UCS C240 M4 server can be deployed standalone or as part of the Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS). Cisco UCS unifies computing, networking, management, virtualization, and storage access into a single integrated architecture that can enable end-to-end server visibility, management, and control in both bare-metal and virtualized environments. With Cisco UCS-managed deployment, UCS C240 M4 takes advantage of our standards-based unified computing innovations to significantly reduce customers’ TCO and increase business agility.
