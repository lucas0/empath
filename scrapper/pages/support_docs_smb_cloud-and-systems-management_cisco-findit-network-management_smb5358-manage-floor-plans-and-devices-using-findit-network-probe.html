Objective
The Floor Plan view on the FindIT Network Probe allows you to keep track of the physical locations of your network devices. You can upload a plan for each floor in the building or buildings, and position each of the network devices on the plan. This helps you easily locate devices if maintenance is required.
The Floor Plan is similar in operation to the Topology Map, and devices placed on the Floor Plan can be operated in the same way as devices in the Topology Map.
This article provides instructions on how to manage Floor Plans on your FindIT Network Probe and place network devices according to their locations.
