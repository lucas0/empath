Introduction
The article describes a process of converting a fulfilled product activation key (PAK) to a Smart License for Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM).
Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure that:
You have the following data at your disposal:
Active Cisco.com account
Administrator or User access to a Smart Account (To request Administrator or User access to a Smart account, refer to How to Request Access to an Existing Smart Account.)
Your PAK is assigned to your Smart Account.
Your CUCM is covered by the Software Support Service (SWSS) contract that is associated with your Cisco.com account.
Note: If you have a contract with Cisco but do not know your company's service contract number or Partner contract agreement number, please contact your Service Contract Sales representative, Point of Sale (Partner), or email web-help@cisco.com.
The product ID (PID) is not BE6K.
Converting a Fulfilled PAK to a Smart License for CUCM
Step 1: 
Go to Cisco Software Central and log in with your Cisco.com account.
Step 2:
In the Traditional Licenses section, click Access LRP.
Step 3:
In the Show Smart Account and Virtual Account drop-down lists, confirm that the correct respective accounts are selected.
Note: If the system displays the Welcome To The License Registration Portal alert dialog box, you can select Do not show this message again to prevent it from being displayed again.
(Optional) Step 4:
Note: If you already have the UUID of your device at your disposal, you can skip to step 6.
On the PAKs or Tokens tab, select a product activation key (PAK) with the Fulfilled status that you want to convert to a Smart license. Click the blue circled chevron icon and select Get PAK or Token information.
Note: Notice that when you click the blue circled chevron icon, the Convert to Smart Licensing option is not available from here.
(Optional) Step 5:
In the PAK/Token dialog box, click the Devices tab, and then copy the UUID sequence. Close the dialog box.
Note: If the product activation key (PAK) has the Fulfilled Status and the Devices tab does not display any device information, you need to open a case in Support Case Manager (SCM) to have the product activation key (PAK) converted to a Smart License.
Step 6:
Click the Devices tab, press Ctrl+F, paste the UUID sequence in the find box, and then press Enter. The system highlights the UUID sequence of the device to which the license from the fulfilled product activation key (PAK) is assigned to.
Step 7:
Select the check box next to the device, click the blue circled chevron icon, and then select Convert Licenses to Smart Licensing.
Step 8:
In the Convert to Smart Entitlements dialog box, select your Virtual Account from the drop-down list, select the check box next to the stock keeping unit (SKU), enter the quantity of the licenses in the Quantity to Convert field, and then click Submit.
Note: If more than one product activation keys (PAKs) are associated with the device, then you can select some or all licenses to be converted in the Convert to Smart Entitlements dialog box.
Step 9:
When the system displays the License Request Status dialog box with the message about successful conversion, note down the Transaction ID, and then click Close
Note: Once you convert the fulfilled product activation key (PAK) to a Smart License, the device that the traditional license was assigned to disappears from the list of devices.
Note: If you experience any issue with converting to Smart License, refer to the Troubleshooting section of this article.
