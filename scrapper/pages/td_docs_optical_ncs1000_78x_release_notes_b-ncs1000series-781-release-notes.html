Network Convergence System 1000 Series
What's New in Cisco NCS 1000 Series, IOS XR Release 7.8.1
NCS 1004
Feature Description
System Setup and Software Installation
Pre and Post-Upgrade Install Health Checks using Profile
This feature allows you to create profiles that define the actions performed during pre and post-upgrade installation checks. You can configure the default actions for:
Pre-upgrade check failure
Upgrade failure
Revert after post-installation check failure
Configuration
Automatic Protection Switching (APS) on OTN XP Card
APS provides protection mechanism against optical fiber faults or signal failure. In case a failure is detected, live traffic is automatically moved from the working path to the protection path to prevent any data loss.
You can enable this feature using the protected keyword of the hw-module command.
Configuration Alarms for Loopback
A configuration alarm is now triggered whenever there is a change in the loopback configuration. This alarm helps in improving loopback status monitoring.
You can now view the alarm details such as, the configuration time and date, description, severity, and location using the show alarms brief system active command.
Digital-to-Analog (DAC) support for NCS1K4-QXP-K9 card
DAC support is now enabled on NCS1K4-QXP-K9 card for 2x100G,3x100G, 4x100G and 400G operating modes. DAC helps in the optimization of digital-to-analog signal conversion.
Encryption Support on OTN-XP Card
AES 256-GCM authenticated OTNSec encryption is supported on the OTN-XP card. The encryption is enabled on the ODUC4 controller.
This encryption secures the data across different datapaths of the OTN-XP card.
Forward Error Correction (FEC) support on QXP card for Ethernet controllers
FEC is now supported by the 100GE Ethernet controller on the NCS1K4-QXP-K9 card. FEC is supported for all pluggables except QSFP-100G-LR4-S and ONS-QSFP28-LR4.
Idle insertion on NCS1K4-QXP-K9 card
Idle insertion refers to the idles that are inserted in the traffic stream from the trunk port to the client port for the duration of the configured holdoff-time. Whenever a fault occurs on the trunk port, you can hold the propagation of local faults using idle insertion. Idle insertion is now enabled on 100GE or 400GE controllers for the NCS1K4-QXP-K9 card.
Laser Squelching
Laser Squelching is now triggered using a new interrupt mechanism to detect faults in the client or trunk connections. Compared to the earlier poll-based triggers, the new interrupt-based mechanism makes the protection switching considerably faster.
This feature is supported on the following line cards with 100GE client rate with the ONS-QSFP28-LR4 pluggable:
NCS1K4-1.2T-K9
NCS1K4-1.2TL-K9
NCS1K4-OTN-XP
NCS1K4-2-QDD-C-K9
NCS1K4-OTN-XP Line Card Interoperability
This feature allows the NCS1K4-OTN-XP card with CFP2-DCO 200G pluggable to interoperate with the NCS2K-400G-XP and NCS4K-4H-OPW-QC2 cards.
Using the new 2x100GE-TXP-MXP mode for the OTN-XP card, you can configure 1x100GE or 2x100GE payloads over 100G or 200G DWDM on the line side, respectively. The interoperation improves customer networks' efficiency, performance, and flexibility, allowing 100GE-TXP traffic over 100G DWDM or 2x100GE-MXP traffic over 200G DWDM wavelengths on each slice.
NCS1K4-QXP-K9 card support for 2x100GE and 3x100GE operating mode configurations
Support is enabled for 2x100GE and 3x100GE operating mode configurations through Open Config and CLI on NCS1K4-QXP-K9 card.
Smart Licensing for OTN-XP Card in Regen Mode
Now the OTN-XP Line Card supports the smart licensing feature in Regen mode. Regen is a signal regenerator and it sits between two nodes to regenerate the signal. it enables you to automate the time-consuming manual licensing tasks and allows you to easily track the status of your license and software usage trends.
Supported modes:
200G
400G
Sub-sea Enhancement
A new NLEQ mode is introduced to enhance the Sub-sea performance.
Telemetry
Event Driven Telemetry Support for Online Insertion and Removal (OIR) of Pluggables
A new sensor path in the OpenConfig model type is introduced to support EDT in NCS 1004 during OIR of the pluggables. It triggers telemetry data such as form factor, SONET-SDH compliance code, FEC corrected bits during removal, and state, channel data during insertion of the NCS 1004 chassis. This telemetry data helps you to track the pluggables present in the NCS 1004 chassis.
NCS 1001
Feature Description
System Setup and Software Installation
Console Swap for NCS 1001
Console swap feature provides a quicker and simpler way to toggle between the following console sessions using a keyboard shortcut:
from XR to Admin console
from Admin to Host console
from Host to XR console
FPD Upgrade Enhancement
FPD upgrade is made easy with a new command upgrade hw-module location all fpd all. It performs the end-to-end upgrade of all FPD modules with a single execution. As a result, the need to make progressive upgrades is eliminated.
Configuration
Troubleshooting User Data Channel (UDC) Port Configurations
The hw-module and show hw-module commands have been enhanced with additional keywords to improve the troubleshooting of issues on UDC ports. Apart from viewing the UDC port state, VLAN list, and port statistics, you can clear UDC port configurations and enable or disable configurations on each UDC port.
YANG Data Models Introduced and Enhanced
We have launched the tool as an easy reference to view the Data Models (Native, Unified, OpenConfig) supported in IOS XR platforms and releases. You can explore the data model definitions, locate a specific model, and view the containers and their respective lists, leaves, leaf lists, Xpaths, and much more.
As we continue to enhance the tool, we would love to hear your feedback. You are welcome to drop us a note here.

Bug Search Tool
Cisco Bug Search Tool (BST) is a web-based tool that acts as a gateway to the Cisco bug tracking system that maintains a comprehensive list of defects and vulnerabilities in Cisco products and software. BST provides you with detailed defect information about your products and software.
Using Bug Search Tool
You can use the Cisco Bug Search Tool to search for a specific bug or to search for all bugs in a release.
Procedure
Step 1
Go to the http://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch.
Step 2
Log in using your registered Cisco.com username and password.
The Bug Search page opens.
Step 3
Use any of these options to search for bugs, and then press Enter (Return) to initiate the search:
To search for a specific bug, enter the bug ID in the Search For field.
To search for bugs based on specific criteria, enter search criteria, such as a problem description, a feature, or a product name, in the Search For field.
To search for bugs based on products, enter or select a product from the Product list. For example, if you enter “WAE,” you get several options from which to choose.
To search for bugs based on releases, in the Releases list select whether to search for bugs affecting a specific release, bugs that were fixed in a specific release, or both. Then enter one or more release numbers in the Releases field.
Step 4
When the search results are displayed, use the filter tools to narrow the results. You can filter the bugs by status, severity, and so on.
To export the results to a spreadsheet, click Export Results to Excel.
