Product overview
Today, data governs all aspects of business decision making, helping to improve efficiencies across the organization. But the impact of the pandemic is driving organizations to look to the Internet of Things (IoT) not just for efficiencies but also for resiliency. To adapt and thrive in the new normal, organizations need data and visibility into their operations even when no one is on the ground.
Monitoring assets and facilities using sensors helps businesses become better, safer, and more resilient. Data such as temperature, humidity, and ingress/egress all impact the status of a facility or an asset, whether it is a motor, a refrigeration unit, or even the networking gear itself. Remote monitoring helps to:
●      Improve employee safety and efficiency by preventing unnecessary site visits and reducing employee movement throughout facilities
●      Reduce expenses by avoiding premature equipment failure
●      Improve customer satisfaction by reducing unplanned network outages and operational downtime
Cisco® Industrial Asset Vision helps to improve safety, business resiliency, and operational efficiencies by monitoring assets and facilities using sensors. It is a simple all-in-one, cloud-managed solution. Industrial Asset Vision has everything you need, from sensors to the gateways to the cloud-managed operations dashboard — integrated, secure, and ready to go.
The solution deploys in minutes using a simple QR or bar code, and scaling is designed to grow with your business. Users gain holistic and actionable insights in one easy-to-use cloud-native dashboard. The dashboard has been optimized to require minimal network expertise, thus reducing the burden on IT or the need for expensive service contracts. The dashboard provides a single view of the asset or facility health across all its associated sensors. It includes the ability to monitor health across related assets and facilities, even down to the gateway itself.

All-in-one simple solution
Other solutions lack integration between network, sensors, and management dashboards, causing long deployment cycles, complexity at scale, and missed insights. In contrast, Cisco Industrial Asset Vision has everything you need, including the sensors, gateways, and management capability, secure, integrated, and ready to deploy.
Cloud-based data operations and management dashboard
Gain holistic and actionable insights in one easy-to-use, cloud-based dashboard. The centralized management dashboard takes the guesswork out of which sensors and gateways monitor and connect to hundreds of locations and thousands of pieces of equipment. It offers a single view of the asset or facility health across all its associated sensors. And it includes the ability to monitor and troubleshoot the gateway itself.
Drill-down menus for assets, sensors, alerts, and networks help both OT and IT staff to quickly see the status and resolve issues through a comprehensive troubleshooting capability. They can set alerts or generate reports to take notification action and to better service their facilities and equipment.
Using REST APIs and the defacto standard MQTT connectivity protocol, Industrial Asset Vision can share data with enterprise systems such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), service management, inventory control, and analytics. User can also integrate with Azure IoT Hub.
Cisco sensors
Cisco Industrial Asset Vision includes a family of industrial sensors that provide telemetry and location information for assets and facilities. They are preintegrated with the Cisco Wireless Gateway for LoRaWAN (IXM) and management dashboard. Most have IP65 and IP67 ratings, allowing them to be deployed in outdoor and industrial indoor environments. Deploy one or many to monitor a wide variety of conditions, including, humidity, leak detection, room temperature, machine temperature, product temperature, ingress and egress, lighting, occupancy, vibration and asset location. All sensors which support battery powering come with batteries and are easy to install.
Cyber security
Backed by Cisco security, investment, and industry expertise, our solutions run on Cisco’s trusted networks so that your data is protected, available, and safe for you to use.
Easy sensor and gateway provisioning
Provisioning and installing Cisco Industrial Asset Vision’s sensors and gateways requires minimal technical expertise. Using a mobile app and a QR code or bar code, the devices are provisioned in seconds and immediately generate either environmental, asset, or geolocation data. This dramatically improves the time to value and the ROI for these IoT projects. Scaling to thousands of sensors becomes a breeze.
Cisco Wireless Gateway for LoRaWAN (IXM gateway)
Industrial Asset Vision includes support for the Cisco IXM gateway. This gateway supports LoRaWAN for wireless connectivity and, like the sensors, is designed for outdoor and industrial indoor spaces. It is ideal for use cases that require long-range wireless connectivity and extended sensor battery life. Its cost-effective ruggedized form factor makes it ideal to deploy in a variety of places. It also provides a high sensor-to-gateway ratio, making deployments very cost-effective. Asset Vision includes an RF Performance tool to help determine the coverage area at customer sites.
Subscription/SaaS model
IoT solutions need implementation models that can grow and scale with enterprise business demands. After a one-time fee for the sensors and gateway hardware, customers pay a low monthly subscription fee based on the number of connected sensors.
Prominent features
Cisco Industrial Asset Vision is simple, scalable, and secure
Sensors provide insights into the status of an asset or a facility, giving you the control you need to improve your operations and your business resilience without being onsite. But today, only a small portion of assets and facilities are connected with sensors. And these sensors are unreliable, unsecure, and difficult to use and scale. They lack the integration between the network, the sensors, and management, causing long deployment cycles, complexity, and missed insights. Cisco Industrial Asset Vision overcomes these challenges. It offers:
●    Accelerated time to value: Sensors and networks from different vendors can lead to long testing cycles and unreliable interoperability between sensors and gateways. Cisco Industrial Asset Vision uses Cisco sensors and Cisco LoRaWAN gateways that are fully validated, resulting in simple, quick, and reliable installation and provisioning.
●      Enterprise scale: Installing and triaging multivendor solutions across sensors, the network, and dashboard applications is challenging — especially at scale. Most current sensor solutions use unmanaged networks with little to no ability to make network updates remotely and securely. These limitations can heavily burden IT or require expensive service contracts to operate at scale. However, Cisco Industrial Asset Vision brings the ability to make changes and updates remotely. For organizations with geographically dispersed assets and facilities, having this capability enables scaling to any size of sensor solution deployment anywhere.
●      Ability to make better and timelier decisions: Without timely and relevant insights, there is a greater risk that problems will go undetected and opportunities to improve efficiencies will be missed. The network is typically non-integrated with the rest of the solution. If there is a problem with the network, it often manifests as a problem with the asset or the sensor environment itself. With Cisco Industrial Asset Vision’s dashboard, customers need only one solution to correlate data and identify business-impacting trends.
●      Cyber Security: Every sensor solution runs the risk of incurring various forms of data loss, intrusion, and malware. Since Cisco Industrial Asset Vision is built on the features and benefits of Cisco security, OT customers can be assured that their solution is running on Cisco’s trusted and managed network. The integrated solution helps reduce complexity and minimize vulnerabilities.

●      To conserve battery, IR detection is not running constantly.
●      IR detection is done within a window called IR Disable Time.
●      IR sensor is asleep during first 70% of IR Disable Time window. Sensor is awake for the last 30%.
●      Once sensor is triggered, sensor continues to evaluate for occupancy according to IR Disable Time window.
●      If motion is detected during the awake window, sensor proceeds to the next IR asleep window and IR Detection Time counter is reset.
●      Once motion has been undetected for the IR Detection Time window, a data report indicating “not occupied” is sent.

Turning AV251 On/Off
To turn the sensor on, press firmly in the center of the power button and release. If the LED blinks for 10 seconds, this means it has entered a waiting state and will not attempt to join the network for 5 minutes. This waiting state can be avoided by turning off (press/release the power button) the sensor for 20 seconds and then turning the sensor back on.
Otherwise, the LED should illuminate for 3 seconds. During this time, the sensor will attempt to register with the Industrial Asset Vision cloud service. When this has succeeded, the LED will again illuminate for 3 seconds. If the sensor is unable to register, the LED will quickly blink for about 10 seconds (this will only happen if multiple attempts over the course of several minutes are unsuccessful). In this case, the sensor should be turned off, the connectivity issue should be resolved, and then the sensor should be turned on, again.
Assuming the batteries are installed and are at a suitable level, if the LED never illuminates or blinks, it means the sensor was already on and now has been turned off.
Mounting Accessories and Methods AV251

Turning AV400 On/Off and Button/LED Behavior
To turn on the AV400, apply power to it; conversely, removing power turns it off.
When the device turns on, it will enter a 5-minute waiting period before attempting to register with the IAV cloud service. This is indicated by a fast blinking of the LED. To avoid the 5-minute waiting period, quickly press/release the button. Note that the registration process will be successful only if the device has first been onboarded with the IAV mobile application.
Once the device starts attempting to register, the LED behavior is shown in the following table.
Table 89.     Startup LED Behavior
LED Behavior
Description
Illuminates solid for 3 seconds (first time)
Registration attempts have started.
Illuminates solid for 3 seconds (second time)
Registration has been successful.
Flashes quickly for 10 seconds
Indicates that repeated registration attempts have been unsuccessful.
This occurs after each failed registration sequence. For the -US and -AU PIDs, a registration sequence is defined as one attempt at a low LoRaWAN spreading factor (suitable for closer range) and one attempt at a higher spreading factor (needed for longer range). For the -EU PID, a registration sequence is defined as one attempt at each spreading factor from SF7 to SF12.
Note: The device will continue trying to register; the LED flashing is just an indication that the device is having problems registering.
Once in normal operation, press/release the button quickly to initiate an immediate sampling of data and associated data report to the cloud. The LED behavior in this scenario is described in the following table.
Table 90.     Manually triggered report LED Behavior
LED Behavior
Description
Single fast blink
Manually triggered data report has been initiated and will be sent within a few seconds.
Several blinks for 10 seconds
Note: This behavior only applies to regions which require duty cycle compliance (the -EU PID of the AV400).
Desire to send a manually triggered data report has been received, but device is not allowed to send it immediately due to regional duty cycle constraints. Message will be sent as soon as possible. Expected time to wait is between ~10 seconds and ~2.5 minutes. In this waiting time, do not continuously press the button.
To reset the unit, press/hold the pushbutton for 5 seconds before releasing. The AV400 will reload back to the initial state of attempting to register with the cloud service.
Installation/Mounting
Wall mounting
1.     Locate the area to install and mark the four screw locations. If needed, drill pilot holes. If installing in concrete, it is recommended to use wall sinks.
2.     Align the device to the holes (or markings) and secure with screws of less than 5mm in diameter.
Figure 38.         
AV400 Wall mounting
Routing data cables
1.     Loosen the four front cover screws and remove front cover.
2.     Insert the sensor cables through the channel on the device. The two cables are physically and electrically identical. It can be helpful to place a piece of tape (or similar) on the ends of one cable so that you can differentiate between the two cables in later steps.
Note:      Position the cable connector for each cable so that it can be connected to the circuit board.
Figure 39.         
AV400 Routing data cables
3.     Connect the sensor cables to the connectors on the device.
Figure 40.         
AV400 Connecting data cables
4.     Align the top cover with the base and install while gently pulling the data cable slack. If there is resistance when pulling, do not pull the cable further to avoid damaging the connector.
5.     Secure the top cover with the screws.
