Chapter Contents
A Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device can act as a transparent bridge, switching traffic between LANs that are part of a Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) at the site of local router. To implement bridging, each VLAN acts as a separate broadcast domain, and each has its own Ethernet switching table (or MAC table) to use for switching traffic within the broadcast domain. Multiple VLANs can coexist in a single Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device.
To allow hosts associated with different VLANs to communicate with each other, Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices support Switch Virtual Interface (SVI). SVIs provide Layer 3 routing services to allow traffic exchange between various VLANs. Each VLAN can have a single SVI.

VLANs
What is a VLAN
A VLAN is a switched network that is logically segmented by function, project team, or application, without regard to the physical locations of the users. VLANs provide the means to divide LAN into smaller broadcast domains. VLANs have the same attributes as physical LANs, but you can group end stations even if they are not physically located on the same LAN segment. Any device port can belong to a VLAN, and unicast, broadcast, and multicast packets are forwarded and flooded only to end stations in the VLAN. Each VLAN is considered a logical network, and packets destined for stations that do not belong to the VLAN must be forwarded through a router or a device supporting fallback bridging. In a device stack, VLANs can be formed with ports across the stack. Because a VLAN is considered a separate logical network, it contains its own bridge Management Information Base (MIB) information and can support its own implementation of spanning tree.
VLANs are often associated with IP subnetworks. For example, all the end stations in a particular IP subnet belong to the same VLAN. Interface VLAN membership on the device is assigned manually on an interface-by-interface basis. When you assign device interfaces to VLANs by using this method, it is known as interface-based, or static, VLAN membership. Traffic between VLANs must be routed. The device can route traffic between VLANs by using device virtual interfaces (SVIs). An SVI must be explicitly configured and assigned an IP address to route traffic between VLANs.
Ports that connect to WAN segments are associated with VLANs. In the Cisco SD-WAN overlay network, these ports are the physical Gigabit Ethernet interfaces on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. Specifically, they are the base interfaces, for example, Gi0/1/0.
There is a one-to-one association between an SVI and a VLAN. An SVI can be associated only with one VLAN, and the other way around.
Native VLANs
Native VLAN is used primarily on trunk ports. VLAN provides backwards compatibility for devices that do not support VLAN tagging. For example, native VLAN allows trunk ports to accept all traffic regardless of what devices are connected to the port. Without native VLAN, the trunk ports would accept traffic only from devices that support VLAN tagging.
SVI
VLANS divide a LAN into smaller broadcast domains. Each VLAN is a separate broadcast domain, and switching within that domain directs traffic to destinations within the VLAN. The result is that hosts within a single bridge domain can communicate among themselves, but cannot communicate with hosts in other VLANs.
The only way for the traffic to cross Layer 2 VLAN boundaries to allow communication between VLANs is through Layer 3 routing. Switch Virtual Interfaces (SVI) on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices is designed to provide basic Layer 3 functions for the Layer 2 switch ports that belong to a specific VLAN. SVI is a logical interface that inherits all the properties of a regular interface, but is not associated with a port or with a physical interface.
The switch ports on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices do not natively support Layer 3 addresses. They must be assigned to an SVI and use a VLAN interface to enable Layer 3 features.
To configure IP routing, you need to assign IP addresses to Layer 3 network interfaces, in this case SVI. This enables communication with the hosts on those interfaces that use IP. IP routing is disabled by default, and no IP addresses are assigned to Switch Virtual Interfaces (SVIs).
VRF
Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) associates a VRF instance with an SVI to map VLANs to different logical or physical VPN WAN connections. VRF allows a single physical router to have multiple route tables to enable multiple routing instances. In a single network component, multiple VRF resources create the isolation between virtual networks.

Configure VRRP
To have an interface run the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), which allows multiple routers to share a common virtual IP address for default gateway redundancy, choose VRRP. Then click Add New VRRP and configure the following parameters:
Table 8.
Parameter Name
Description
Group ID
Enter the virtual router ID, which is a numeric identifier of the virtual router. You can configure a maximum of 24 groups. Range: 1 through 255
Priority
Enter the priority level of the router. There router with the highest priority is elected as the primary router. If two Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices have the same priority, the one with the higher IP address is elected as the primary one. Range: 1 through 254 Default: 100
Timer
Specify how often the primary VRRP router sends VRRP advertisement messages. If the subordinate routers miss three consecutive VRRP advertisements, they elect a new primary router. Range: 1 through 3600 seconds Default: 1 second
Track OMP Track Prefix List
By default, VRRP uses of the state of the service (LAN) interface on which it is running to determine which Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device is the primary virtual router. if a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device loses all its WAN control connections, the LAN interface still indicates that it is up even though the router is functionally unable to participate in VRRP. To take WAN side connectivity into account for VRRP, configure one of the following:
Track OMP—Click On for VRRP to track the Overlay Management Protocol (OMP) session running on the WAN connection. If the primary VRRP router loses all its OMP sessions, VRRP elects a new default gateway from those that have at least one active OMP session.
Track Prefix List—Track both the OMP session and a list of remote prefixes, which is defined in a prefix list configured on the local router. If the primary VRRP router loses all its OMP sessions, VRRP failover occurs as described for the Track OMP option. In addition, if reachability to all of the prefixes in the list is lost, VRRP failover occurs immediately, without waiting for the OMP hold timer to expire, thus minimizing the amount of overlay traffic is dropped while the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device determines the primary VRRP router.
IP Address
Enter the IP address of the virtual router. This address must be different from the configured interface IP addresses of both the local Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device and the peer running VRRP.
Add ARP Table Entries
To configure static Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) table entries on the interface, choose ARP. Then click Add New ARP and configure the following parameters:
Table 9.
Parameter Name
Description
IP Address
Enter the IP address for the ARP entry in dotted decimal notation or as a fully qualified host name.
MAC Address
