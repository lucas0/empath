Cisco ISE Authentication Policies
Authentication policies define the protocols that Cisco ISE uses to communicate with the network devices, and the identity sources that it uses for authentication. A policy is a set of conditions and a result. A policy condition consists of an operand (attribute), an operator (equal to, not equal to, greater than, and so on), and a value. Compound conditions are made up of one or more simple conditions that are connected by the AND or OR operator. At runtime, Cisco ISE evaluates a policy condition and then applies the result that you have defined based on whether the policy evaluation returns a true or a false value.
An authentication policy consists of the following:
Network Access Service—This service can be one of the following:
An allowed protocols service to choose the protocols to handle the initial request and protocol negotiation.
A proxy service that will proxy requests to an external RADIUS server for processing.
Identity Source—An identity source or an identity source sequence to be used for authentication.
After installation, a default identity authentication policy is available in Cisco ISE that is used for authentications. Any updates to the authentication policy will override the default settings.

Policy Condition Evaluation
During policy condition evaluation, Cisco ISE compares an attribute with a value. It is possible to run into a situation where the attribute specified in the policy condition may not have a value assigned in the request. In such cases, if the operator that is used for comparison is “not equal to,” then the condition will evaluate to true. In all other cases, the condition will evaluate to false.
For example, for a condition Radius.Calling_Station_ID Not Equal to 1.1.1.1, if the Calling Station ID is not present in the RADIUS request, then this condition will evaluate to true. This evaluation is not unique to the RADIUS dictionary and occurs because of the usage of the “Not Equal to” operator.
Supported Authentication Protocols
The following is a list of protocols that you can choose while defining your authentication policy:
Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)
Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP)
Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol Version 2 (MS-CHAPv2)
Extensible Authentication Protocol-Message Digest 5 (EAP-MD5)
Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS)
Extensible Authentication Protocol-Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling (EAP-FAST)
Extensible Authentication Protocol-Tunneled Transport Layer Security (EAP-TTLS)
Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security (PEAP-TLS)

Supported Authentication Types and Database
Authentication Policy Terminology
Supported Authentication Types and Database
The authentication type is based on the protocols that are chosen. The authentication type is password based, where the authentication is performed against a database with the username and password that is presented in the request.
The identity method, which is the result of the authentication policy, can be any one of the following:
Deny access—Access to the user is denied and no authentication is performed.
Identity database—A single identity database that can be any one of the following:
Internal users
Guest users
Internal endpoints
Active Directory
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) database
RADIUS token server (RSA or SafeWord server)
Certificate authentication profile
Identity source sequences—A sequence of identity databases that is used for authentication.
By default, the identity source that Cisco ISE will look up for user information is the internal users database.
Types of Authentication Failures—Failovers
If you choose the identity method as deny access, a reject message is sent as a response to the request. If you choose an identity database or an identity source sequence and the authentication succeeds, the processing continues to the authorization policy. Some of the authentications fail and these are classified as follows:
Authentication failed—Received explicit response that authentication has failed such as bad credentials, disabled user, and so on. The default course of action is reject.
User not found—No such user was found in any of the identity databases. The default course of action is reject.
Process failed—Unable to access the identity database or databases. The default course of action is drop.
Cisco ISE allows you to configure any one of the following courses of action for authentication failures:
Reject—A reject response is sent.
Drop—No response is sent.
Continue—Cisco ISE continues with the authorization policy.
Even when you choose the Continue option, there might be instances where Cisco ISE cannot continue processing the request due to restrictions on the protocol that is being used. For authentications using PEAP, LEAP, EAP-FAST, EAP-TLS, or RADIUS MSCHAP, it is not possible to continue processing the request when authentication fails or user is not found.
When authentication fails, it is possible to continue to process the authorization policy for PAP/ASCII and MAC authentication bypass (MAB or host lookup). For all other authentication protocols, when authentication fails, the following happens:
Authentication failed—A reject response is sent.
User or host not found—A reject response is sent.
Process failure—No response is sent and the request is dropped.
Authentication Policy Terminology
The following are some of the commonly used terms in the authentication policy pages:
Allowed Protocols—Allowed protocols define the set of protocols that Cisco ISE can use to communicate with the device that requests access to the network resources.
Identity Source—Identity source defines which database Cisco ISE should use for user information. The database could be an internal database or an external identity source, such as Active Directory or LDAP. You can add a sequence of databases to an identity source sequence and list this sequence as the identity source in your policy. Cisco ISE will search for the credentials in the order in which the databases are listed in this sequence.
Failover Options—You can define what course of action Cisco ISE should take if the authentication fails, the user is not found, or if the process fails.
Simple Authentication Policies
A simple authentication policy allows you to statically define the allowed protocols and the identity source or identity source sequence that Cisco ISE should use for communication. You cannot define any condition for simple policies. Cisco ISE assumes that all conditions are met and uses the following definitions to determine the result:
You can create simple policies in situations where you can statically define the allowed protocols and the identity source that must be used always, and no condition needs to be checked.
You can also create proxy service-based simple policies. Cisco ISE proxies the request to a policy server to determine which identity source should be used for user authentication. If the request is proxied to a different policy server, the protocol negotiation does not happen. The policy server evaluates which identity source should be used for authentication and returns the response to Cisco ISE.

Figure 1. Simple Authentication Policy Flow
The result of a simple policy can be any one of the following:
Authentication passed
Authentication failed
An authentication can fail happens due to any of the following reasons:
Bad credentials or disabled user.
User not found.
Authentication process fails.
Guidelines for Configuring Simple Authentication Policies
Follow these guidelines when configuring simple authentication policies:
If you wish to use the RADIUS server sequence, then you must define this access service before you define the policy.
If your users are defined in external identity sources, ensure that you have configured these identity sources in Cisco ISE before you define the policy.
If you want to use an identity source sequence for authenticating users, ensure that you have created the identity source sequence before you define the policy.
When you switch between simple and rule-based authentication policies, you will lose the policy that you configured earlier. For example, if you configured a simple authentication policy and you want to move to a rule-based authentication policy, you will lose the simple authentication policy. Also, when you move from a rule-based authentication policy to a simple authentication policy, you will lose the rule-based authentication policy.
Host authentication is performed with the MAC address only (MAB).

Rule-Based Authentication Policies
Rule-based authentication policies consist of attribute-based conditions that determine the allowed protocols and the identity source or identity source sequence to be used for processing the requests. In a simple authentication policy, you can define the allowed protocols and identity source statically. In a rule-based policy, you can define conditions that allows Cisco ISE to dynamically choose the allowed protocols and identity sources. You can define one or more conditions using any of the attributes from the Cisco ISE dictionary.
Cisco ISE allows you to create conditions as individual, reusable policy elements that can be referred from other rule-based policies. You can also create conditions from within the policy creation page. The two types of conditions are:
Simple condition
Compound condition

Rule-Based Authentication Policy Flow
In rule-based policies, you can define multiple rules. The identity database is selected based on the first rule that matches the criteria.
You can also define an identity source sequence consisting of different databases. You can define the order in which you want Cisco ISE to look up these databases. Cisco ISE will access these databases in sequence until the authentication succeeds. If there are multiple instances of the same user in an external database, the authentication fails. There can only be one user record in an identity source.
We recommend that you use only three, or at most four databases in an identity source sequence.

Protocol Settings for Authentication
You must define global protocol settings in Cisco ISE before you can use these protocols to create, save and implement a policy set to process an authentication request. You can use the Protocol Settings page to define global options for the Extensible Authentication Protocol-Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling (EAP-FAST), Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS), and Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP) protocols, which communicate with the other devices in your network.

Guidelines for Using EAP-FAST as Authentication Protocol
Guidelines for Using EAP-FAST as Authentication Protocol
Follow these guidelines when using EAP-FAST as an authentication protocol:
It is highly recommended to enable EAP-TLS inner method when the EAP-FAST accept client certificate is enabled on authenticated provisioning. EAP-FAST accept client certificate on authenticated provisioning is not a separate authentication method but a shorter form of client certificate authentication that uses the same certificate credentials type to authenticate a user but does not require to run an inner method.
Accept client certificate on authenticated provisioning works with PAC-less full handshake and authenticated PAC provisioning. It does not work for PAC-less session resume, anonymous PAC provisioning, and PAC-based authentication.
EAP attributes are displayed per identity (so in EAP chaining displayed twice) are shown in authentication details in monitoring tool in order user then machine even if authentication happens in different order.
When EAP-FAST authorization PAC is used then EAP authentication method shown in live logs is equal to the authentication method used for full authentication (as in PEAP) and not as Lookup.
In EAP chaining mode when tunnel PAC is expired then ISE falls back to provisioning and AC requests User and Machine authorization PACs - Machine Authorization PAC cannot be provisioned. It will be provisioned in the subsequent PAC-based authentication conversation when AC requests it.
When Cisco ISE is configured for chaining and AC for single mode then AC response with IdentityType TLV to ISE. However, the second identity authentication fails. You can see from this conversation that client is suitable to perform chaining but currently is configured for single mode.
Cisco ISE supports retrieval attributes and groups for both machine and user in EAP-FAST chaining only for AD. For LDAP and Internal DB ISE uses only the last identity attributes.

Note
“EAP-FAST cryptobinding verification failed” message might be seen if EAP-FAST authentication protocol is used for High Sierra, Mojave, or Catalina MAC OSX devices. We recommend that you configure the Preferred EAP Protocol field in the Allowed Protocols page to use PEAP or EAP-TLS instead of EAP-FAST for these MAC OSX devices.

Using EAP-TTLS as Authentication Protocol
EAP-TTLS is a two-phase protocol that extends the functionality of EAP-TLS protocol. Phase 1 builds the secure tunnel and derives the session keys used in Phase 2 to securely tunnel attributes and inner method data between the server and the client. You can use the attributes tunneled during Phase 2 to perform additional authentications using a number of different mechanisms.
Cisco ISE can process authentications from a variety of TTLS supplicants including:
AnyConnect Network Access Manager (NAM) on Windows
Windows 8.1 native supplicant
Secure W2 (also called as JoinNow on MultiOS)
MAC OS X native supplicant
IOS native supplicant
Android based native supplicant

Define Allowed Protocols for Network Access
Allowed protocols define the set of protocols that Cisco ISE can use to communicate with the device that requests access to the network resources. An allowed protocols access service is an independent entity that you should create before you configure authentication policies. Allowed protocols access service is an object that contains your chosen protocols for a particular use case.
The Allowed Protocols Services page lists all the allowed protocols services that you create. There is a default network access service that is predefined in the Cisco ISE.
Before you begin
Before you begin this procedure, you should have a basic understanding of the protocol services that are used for authentication.
Review the Cisco ISE Authentication Policies section in this chapter to understand authentication type and the protocols that are supported by various databases.
Review the PAC Options to understand the functions and options for each protocol service, so you can make the selections that are appropriate for your network.
Ensure that you have defined the global protocol settings.
To perform the following task, you must be a Super Admin or System Admin.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Policy > Policy Elements > Results > Authentication > Allowed Protocols.
If Cisco ISE is set to operate in FIPS mode, some protocols are disabled by default and cannot be configured.
Step 2
Click Add.
Step 3
Enter the required information.
Step 4
Select the appropriate authentication protocols and options for your network.
Step 5
If you choose to use PACs, make the appropriate selections.
To enable Anonymous PAC Provisioning, you must choose both the inner methods, EAP-MSCHAPv2 and Extensible Authentication Protocol-Generic Token Card (EAP-GTC). Also, be aware that Cisco ISE only supports Active Directory as an external identity source for machine authentication.
Step 6
Click Submit to save the allowed protocols service.
The allowed protocols service appears as an independent object in the simple and rule-based authentication policy pages. You can use this object in different rules.
You can now create a simple or rule-based authentication policy.
If you disable EAP-MSCHAP as inner method and enable EAP-GTC and EAP-TLS inner methods for PEAP or EAP-FAST, ISE starts EAP-GTC inner method during inner method negotiation. Before the first EAP-GTC message is sent to the client, ISE executes identity selection policy to obtain GTC password from the identity store. During the execution of this policy, EAP authentication is equal to EAP-GTC. If EAP-GTC inner method is rejected by the client and EAP-TLS is negotiated, identity store policy is not executed again. In case identity store policy is based on EAP authentication attribute, it might have unexpected results since the real EAP authentication is EAP-TLS but was set after identity policy evaluation.

In the Host Lookup (MAB) section, do the following:
Process Host Lookup—Check this check box to define the protocols for host lookup used by the network device profile.
Network devices from different vendors perform MAB authentication differently. Depending on the device type, check the Check Password check box and/or Check Calling-Station-Id equals MAC Address check box, for the protocol you are using.
Via PAP/ASCII—Check this check box to configure Cisco ISE to detect a PAP request from the network device profile as a Host Lookup request.
Via CHAP—Check this check box to configure Cisco ISE to detect this type of request from the network devices as a Host Lookup request.
Via EAP-MD5—Check this check box to enable EAP-based MD5 hashed authentication for the network device profile.
Enter the required details in the Permissions, Change of Authorization (CoA), and Redirect sections, and then click Submit.
For information on how to create custom NAD profiles, see Network Access Device Profiles with Cisco Identity Services Engine.
Step 3

Step 4
Select the device for which you want to enable MAB, and then click Edit.
Step 5
In the Network Device page, select the network device profile that you created in step 2 from the Device Profile drop-down list.
Step 6
Click Save.

Note
For Cisco NADs, the Service-Type values used for MAB and web/user authentication are different. This allows ISE to differentiate MAB from web authentication when Cisco NADs are used. Some non-Cisco NADs use the same value for the Service-Type attribute for both MAB and web/user authentication; this may lead to security issues in your access policies. If you are using MAB with non-Cisco devices, we recommend that you configure additional authorization policy rules to ensure that your network security is not compromised. For example, if a printer is using MAB, you could configure an authorization policy rule to restrict it to printer protocol ports in the ACL.

Cisco ISE Acting as a RADIUS Proxy Server
Cisco ISE can function both as a RADIUS server and as a RADIUS proxy server. When it acts as a proxy server, Cisco ISE receives authentication and accounting requests from the network access server (NAS) and forwards them to the external RADIUS server. Cisco ISE accepts the results of the requests and returns them to the NAS.
Cisco ISE can simultaneously act as a proxy server to multiple external RADIUS servers. You can use the external RADIUS servers that you configure here in RADIUS server sequences. The External RADIUS Server page lists all the external RADIUS servers that you have defined in Cisco ISE. You can use the filter option to search for specific RADIUS servers based on the name or description, or both. In both simple and rule-based authentication policies, you can use the RADIUS server sequences to proxy the requests to a RADIUS server.
The RADIUS server sequence strips the domain name from the RADIUS-Username attribute for RADIUS authentications. This domain stripping is not applicable for EAP authentications, which use the EAP-Identity attribute. The RADIUS proxy server obtains the username from the RADIUS-Username attribute and strips it from the character that you specify when you configure the RADIUS server sequence. For EAP authentications, the RADIUS proxy server obtains the username from the EAP-Identity attribute. EAP authentications that use the RADIUS server sequence will succeed only if the EAP-Identity and RADIUS-Username values are the same.

Location Based Authorization
Cisco ISE integrates with Cisco Mobility Services Engine (MSE) to introduce physical location-based authorization. Cisco ISE uses information from MSE to provide differentiated network access based on the actual location of the user, as reported by MSE.
With this feature, you can use the endpoint location information to provide network access when a user is in an appropriate zone. You can also add the endpoint location as an additional attribute for policies to define more granulated policy authorization sets based on device location. You can configure conditions within authorization rules that use location-based attributes, for example:
MSE.Location Equals LND_Campus1:Building1:Floor2:SecureZone
You can define the location hierarchy (campus/building/floor structure) and configure the secure and non-secure zones using the Cisco Prime Infrastructure application. After defining the location hierarchy, you must synchronize the location hierarchy data with the MSE servers. For more information on Cisco Prime Infrastructure, see: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/cloud-systems-management/prime-infrastructure/products-user-guide-list.html.
You can add one or multiple MSE instances to integrate MSE-based location data to the authorization process. You can retrieve the location hierarchy data from these MSEs and configure location-based authorization rules using this data.
To track the endpoint movement, check the Track Movement check box while creating an authorization profile. Cisco ISE will query the relevant MSE for the endpoint location every 5 minutes to verify if the location was changed.
Add an MSE server
Location Tree
Add an MSE server
Before you begin
To perform the following task, you must be a Super Admin or System Admin.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Administration > Network Resources > Location Services > Location Servers.
Step 2
Click Add.
Step 3
Enter the MSE server details, such as server name, hostname/IP address, password, and so on.
Step 4
Click Test to test MSE connectivity using the server details that you have provided.
Step 5
(Optional) Enter the MAC address of an endpoint in the Find Location field and click Find to check whether the endpoint is currently connected to this MSE.
If the endpoint location is found, it is displayed in the following format: Campus:Building:Floor:Zone. Sometimes, more than one entry can be displayed depending on the location hierarchy and zone settings. For example, if all the floors of a building (building1) in a campus named Campus1 are defined as non-secure zones, and the Lab Area in the first floor is defined as a secure zone, the following entries will be displayed when the endpoint is located in the Lab Area:
Found in:
Campus1#building1#floor1#LabArea
Campus1#building1#floor1#NonSecureZone
Step 6
Click Submit.
After a new MSE is added, go to the Location Tree page and click Get Update to retrieve its location hierarchy and add it to the Location Tree. If there are filters defined on this tree, these filters are applied on the new MSE entries as well.
Location Tree
The Location Tree is created by using the location data retrieved from the MSE instances. To view the Location Tree, choose Administration > Network Resources > Location Services > Location Tree.
If one building has multiple MSEs, Cisco ISE will collate the location details from all the MSEs and present them as a single tree.
You can select the location entries that are exposed to the authorization policy by using the Location Tree. You can also hide specific locations based on your requirements. It is recommended to update the Location Tree before hiding locations. Hidden locations will remain hidden even when the tree is updated.
If the location entries related to an authorization rule are modified or removed, you must disable the affected rules and set these locations as Unknown or select a replacement location for each affected rule. You must verify the new tree structure before applying the change or canceling the update.
Click Get Update to get the latest location hierarchy structure from all MSEs. After verifying the new tree structure, click Save to apply your changes.
Policy Modes
Cisco ISE provides two types of policy modes, the Simple mode and the Policy Set mode. You can select either one of these to configure authentication and authorization policies. When you change the policy mode, you are prompted to login again to the Cisco ISE interface. If you switch from the Policy Set mode to the Simple mode, all the policy set data is deleted except the default policy. The Policy menu options change based on the policy mode selection.
Simple Mode—If you select Simple mode, you can define authentication and authorization policies separately in the Policy menu.
Figure 3. Simple Mode Policy Menu
Policy Set Mode—If you select Policy Set mode, you can create policy sets and logically group authentication and authorization within the same group. You can have several groups based on what you need.

Configure a Simple Authentication Policy
The procedure for configuring a simple authentication policy includes defining an allowed protocols service and configuring a simple authentication policy.
Before you begin
To configure a simple authentication policy using the RADIUS server sequence, you should have a basic understanding of the Cisco ISE authentication policies and proxy service to understand authentication types and the protocols that are supported by various databases.
You should have defined an allowed protocol access service or RADIUS server sequence.
To perform the following task, you must be a Super Admin or System Admin.
You can also use this process to configure a simple policy using RADIUS server sequence.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Policy > Authentication.
Step 2
Click OK on the message that appears.
Step 3
Enter the values as required.
Step 4
Click Save to save your simple authentication policy.

Cisco ISE Authentication Policies
Configure a Rule-Based Authentication Policy
In a rule-based policy, you can define conditions that allows Cisco ISE to dynamically choose the allowed protocols and identity sources. You can define one or more conditions using any of the attributes from the Cisco ISE dictionary.

Tip
We recommend that you create the allowed protocol access services, conditions, and identity source sequences before you create the rule-based authentication policy. If you want to use the RADIUS server sequence, you can define the RADIUS server sequence before you create the policy.
Before you begin
You should have a basic understanding of the rule-based authentication policies, defined allowed protocols for network access, created identity source sequence, and RADIUS server sequence (if you want to use the RADIUS server sequence in place of the allowed protocol access service).
Cisco ISE comes with predefined rule-based authentication policies for the Wired 802.1X, Wireless 802.1X, and Wired MAB use cases.
To perform the following task, you must be a Super Admin or System Admin.
If your users are defined in external identity sources, ensure that you have configured these identity sources in Cisco ISE.

Note
When you switch between a simple and a rule-based authentication policy, you will lose the policy that you configured earlier. For example, if you have a simple authentication policy configured and you want to move to a rule-based authentication policy, you will lose the simple authentication policy. Also, when you move from a rule-based authentication policy to a simple authentication policy, you will lose the rule-based authentication policy.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Policy > Authentication.
Step 2
Click the Rule-Based radio button.
Step 3
Click OK on the message that appears.
Step 4
Click the action icon and click Insert new row above or Insert new row below based on where you want the new policy to appear in this list. The policies will be evaluated sequentially.
Each row in this rule-based policy page is equivalent to the simple authentication policy. Each row contains a set of conditions that determine the allowed protocols and identity sources.
Step 5
Enter the values as required to create a new authentication policy.
Step 6
Click Save to save your rule-based authentication policies.
You cannot specify the “UserName” attribute when configuring an authentication policy when the EAP-FAST client certificate is sent in the outer TLS negotiation. Cisco recommends using certificate fields like “CN” and “SAN,” for example.
ISE does not restrict a user or machine EAP-TLS authentication against Active Directory when the account in Active Directory is set to deny the user or machine using logon hours, locked-out, or workstations attributes. You should not use these attributes to restrict a user or machine for EAP-TLS authentications.

Default Authentication Policy
The last row in the authentications policy page is the default policy that will be applied if none of the rules match the request. You can edit the allowed protocols and identity source selection for the default policy.
It is a good practice to choose Deny Access as the identity source in the default policy if the request does not match any of the other policies that you have defined.
Policy Sets
Policy sets enable you to logically group authentication and authorization policies within the same set. You can have several policy sets based on an area, such as policy sets based on location, access type and similar parameters.
Policy sets are first-match policies. Each policy has a condition that can be a simple or a compound condition, and have the following supported dictionaries:
Airspace
Cisco
Cisco-BBSM
Cisco-VPN3000
Device, Microsoft
NetworkAccess
RADIUS
Once the policy set is matched and selected, its authentication and authorization policies are evaluated. In addition, a global authorization exception policy is available as part of the policy set model.
There is always one policy set defined, which is the default policy set.

Policy Set Evaluation Flow
Figure 5. Policy Set Authentication and Authorization Evaluation Flow
The sequence of policy set and the authentication and authorization evaluation flow is as follows:
Evaluate policy set (by evaluating the policy set condition). As a result, one policy set is selected.
Evaluate allowed protocols rules of the selected policy set.
Evaluate ID store rules of the selected policy set.
Evaluate authorization rules of the selected policy set, based on the following paradigm:
Evaluate the local exception policy in case it is defined
If no match is found in Step 1 above, evaluate global exception policy if defined
If no match is found in Step 2 above, evaluate authorization rules
If none of the policy set matches, the default policy set will be selected.
Guidelines for Creating Policy Sets
Following are the guidelines for creating policy sets:
Rules are configured with names, conditions, and results. You must define authentication and authorization rules in order to implement a policy set. The default pre-configured policy set that is installed automatically with ISE, as well as any new policy sets that you create, are automatically created with the existing default authentication and authorization policy rules which you can then edit or supplement.
You can duplicate rules that are of the same rule type (either authentication or authorization) and only within the same policy set.
Rules cannot be shared by different policy sets; each policy set has its own rule, however conditions can be shared in case you use the condition library.
Global Authorization Exception Policy
The global authorization exception policy allows you to define rules that apply to all policy sets. The global authorization exception policy is added to each authorization policy of all the policy set. Global authorization exception policy can be updated by selecting the Global Exceptions option from the policy set list.
Each authorization policy can have local exception rule, global exception rule, and regular rules. Once you configure the local authorization exception rule, (for some authorization policies) the global exception authorization rules are displayed in read-only mode in conjunction to the local authorization exception rule. The local authorization exception rule can overwrite the global exception rule. The authorization rules are processed in the following order: first the local exception rule, then the global exception rule, and finally, the regular rule of the authorization policy.
Configure Policy Sets
You can use this page to configure Policy sets.
Before you begin
You should have selected the policy mode as Policy Set to be able to configure Policy sets. To do this, go to Administration > System > Settings > Policy Sets.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Policy > Policy Sets.
Step 2
Click the Default policy. The default policy is displayed in the right.
Step 3
Click the plus (+) sign on top and choose Create Above.
Step 4
Enter the name, description and a condition for this group policy.
Step 5
Define the authentication policy.
Step 6
Define the authorization policy.
Step 7
Click Submit. After you configure a policy set, Cisco ISE logs you out. You must log in again to access the Admin portal.
