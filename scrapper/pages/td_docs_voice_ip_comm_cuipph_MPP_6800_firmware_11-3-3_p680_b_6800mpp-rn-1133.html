DNS SRV Support for XMPP
You can use Domain Name System Service (DNS SRV) records to establish connection between the BroadSoft XMPP server and the phone. The phone looks for the IP address of the XMPP server, it first sends DNS SRV query on the given domain name. If there is no A record in the DNS SRV response, then it tires A record lookup for the same domain.
To enable this feature, you can use the Port field under the Broadsoft XMPP section from Voice > Phone. The port number must be set to 0.

Precondition signaling defers incoming call notifications until the phone receives the message that preconditions are satisfied to establish the call.
To enable this feature, you can use the Precondition Support field under the SIP Settings section from Voice > Ext (n).

Synchronization of Call Waiting and Anonymous Call Rejection
You can enable synchronization of the Call Waiting and Anonymous Call Rejection functions between a specific line and a BroadSoft server. When enabled, the line gets the latest status of the functions from the BroadSoft server, and the line can put the setting of the functions to the BroadSoft server. For example, if the functions are disabled on the BroadSoft server, the functions don't work on the line. If the user enables or disables the functions on the line, the setting modifies the status of the functions on the BroadSoft server.
The setting of the synchronization is only available for specific lines. The priority of the synchronized functions is higher than the local call waiting (CW Setting) and anonymous call blocking (Block ANC Setting) functions. The settings of the local functions are under the Supplementary Services section from Voice > User of the phone administration web page.
To enable synchronization of Call Waiting between a line and an XSI service, use the Call Waiting Enable field under the XSI Line Service section from Voice > Ext (n) of the phone administration web page.
To enable synchronization of Anonymous Call Rejection between a line and an XSI service, use the Block Anonymous Call Enable field under the XSI Line Service section from Voice > Ext (n) of the phone administration web page.

Unavailable Text Box of Agent Status Control
This feature enables you to control the availability of the Unavailable menu text box of the agent status on the phone. To control the display of this text box for each line, use the Unavailable Reason Code Enable parameter on the Voice > Ext(n) tab of the phone administration web page. Set the parameter to No to hide the Unavailable menu text box.
