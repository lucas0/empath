Section 2 - Non-entitlement to Cisco warranty and service support of destroyed, stolen, or scrapped Cisco products
Introduction
The integrity of a customer’s network is of paramount importance. Cisco’s ability to properly support customer networks is premised on the basis that the Cisco products and related software in such networks comprise genuine products or software that have not been destroyed, stolen or otherwise constitute scrapped materials. The following policy is intended to capture this key premise. This policy is subject to change at any time and without notice.
A. Objective:
This policy sets forth the invalidity of warranty and service support for any Destroyed, Stolen, or Scrapped Product. This policy is intended to support and be consistent with other relevant Cisco policies, such as those regarding Cisco trademarks and copyright materials, Software Licensing, Non-Genuine Products, programs that permit Cisco’s authorized resellers and distributors to sell legitimate and genuine Cisco products and services, and any other Cisco policies referenced in this policy.
B. Scope:
This policy applies globally.
C. Definitions:
1.     “Destroyed Product(s)” means Cisco products that have been determined to have been “destroyed” under any circumstances whatsoever, and declared as such, including, but not limited to, accident or natural causes (such as earthquake, hurricane, fire, flood, or other exposure to adverse environmental conditions) or due to any negligent or willful or unlawful act or omission to act (including acts of terrorism and/or or exposure to harmful substances, conditions or materials).
2.     “Destroyed Product(s) can also mean those products that have been identified as “destroyed” by a customer, authorized Cisco reseller, distributor or other third party (i.e. insurance carrier for customer) who legally takes possession or title to the “destroyed” products, on a Certificate of Destruction (“COD”) that is provided to Cisco.
3.     “Stolen Product” means any Cisco product that a customer has reported to the appropriate legal authorities as stolen and has likewise notified Cisco, through customer’s designated representative(s). Cisco may seek verifying information from customers or law enforcement authorities as to the status of the subject product.
4.     “Scrapped Product” means any Cisco product that has reached the end of its useful life or which, for quality control or other reasons, Cisco determines should become waste and is designated for, or actually is, disposed of by Cisco or designated Cisco authorized repair partners.
D. Policy:
1.     Warranties. Cisco does not offer any kind of warranty support whatsoever for Destroyed, Stolen, or Scrapped Products. None of Cisco’s written warranties (as set forth at https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/warranty-listing.html or elsewhere) applies to any Destroyed, Stolen, or Scrapped Products.
2.     Services. Cisco does not offer for sale or otherwise any services whatsoever for Destroyed, Stolen, or Scrapped Products. None of Cisco’s service offerings (as set forth on any of Cisco’s price lists) applies to any Destroyed, Stolen, or Scrapped Products.
3.     Any and all service contracts and/or hardware or software warranty obligations pertaining to Destroyed, Stolen, or Scrapped Products are void. Upon Cisco’s discovery and verification of products as Destroyed, Stolen, or Scrapped Products, Cisco shall immediate terminate any and all associated services and/or warranty support for such Destroyed, Stolen, or Scrapped Products, and may take other available actions. No refund shall apply for terminating any and all associated services support for Destroyed, Stolen, or Scrapped Products.
4.     Refurbished Equipment. Cisco does not offer services, or authorize or endorse any third party, to refurbish any Destroyed, Stolen, or Scrapped Products. Cisco’s Authorized Refurbished Equipment Program (found at https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/buy/cisco-capital-finance/refresh/overview.html) and related software licensing (found at https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/hw-sw-relicensing-program.html#~policy#~using) do not apply to any Destroyed, Stolen, or Scrapped Products. Hence, sections D (1) and (2) above are equally applicable to Destroyed, Stolen, or Scrapped Products that have been subjected to any type of refurbishment efforts.
5.     Inspections. Cisco does not offer, authorize or endorse any kind of used equipment inspection or recertification for Destroyed, Stolen, or Scrapped Products.
6.     Return Material Authorizations. Cisco does not accept Destroyed, Stolen, or Scrapped Products as a part of Cisco’s Return Material Authorization (“RMA”) process for Advanced Replacements. Destroyed, Stolen, or Scrapped Products sent to Cisco either directly or via a Cisco-authorized reseller shall not qualify as meeting Cisco’s RMA requirements.
E. Policy implications:
1.     Any Cisco product that has been identified as a Destroyed, Stolen, or Scrapped Product (per serial number) shall be appropriately identified in Cisco’s databases as ineligible for any kind of warranty or service support.
2.     Any otherwise valid warranty support or services for a Cisco product that becomes subject to destruction, reported theft, or scrapping shall immediately become void and terminate upon such destruction.
3.     Cisco shall assume no obligation or liability for Destroyed, Stolen, or Scrapped Products.
4.     If, per Cisco’s Advanced Replacement services and warranty support, a customer receives a replacement product from Cisco and then improperly returns to Cisco a Destroyed, Stolen, or Scrapped Product (instead of the actual defective Cisco product for which the advanced replacement product was provided), Cisco retains the right to invoice the customer for the then-current list price for a genuine Cisco replacement product, and may take other actions, including, termination of the customer’s support contract and/or pursue other available actions.
5.     Cisco encourages the removal of any and all Destroyed, Stolen, or Scrapped Products from customer networks in order to eliminate or reduce risks associated with keeping such Destroyed, Stolen, or Scrapped Products in the networks.

6.     “End User Customer” means the business entity identified by the party placing the applicable purchase order with Cisco as the initial end user of the Cisco Product in question.
C. Policy
1.     Services and Warranty. Illegally Imported Products and Unauthorized Products do not benefit from Cisco warranties. Illegally Imported Products are ineligible for support services. Unauthorized products may only become eligible for support services following a successful physical inspection and appropriate proof to Cisco showing that any applicable appropriate software license fees have been paid for the said Unauthorized Products (or that payment is made for such licenses if no prior payment has been made) by or on behalf of the end user who will be using the Unauthorized Products in question. Other fees, such as those for reinstatement of services, may also apply.
2.     Refurbished Equipment. Cisco does not authorize or endorse any third party to refurbish Unauthorized Products. However, Cisco does offer refurbished products for sale through the Cisco Authorized Refurbished Equipment Program. Information about the program is available at: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/buy/cisco-capital-finance/refresh/overview.html. Information about Cisco’s software transfer and re-licensing policy is available at: https://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/cisco_software_transfer_relicensing_policy.html
3.     Inspection Fees. Contact your local Cisco service account representative for more information about Cisco’s inspection fees and process.
4.     Software Support. Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco EULA. In most cases the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.
D. Policy implications
1.     Any Illegally Imported Product is ineligible for any kind of Cisco warranty, service, or software support. Any Unauthorized Product is ineligible for any kind of Cisco warranty.

3.     Cisco may (a) invoice the customer for the then-current list price for the genuine Cisco replacement product; and (b) pursue other available actions, up to, and including, termination of the customer’s support contract when:
(i)     a customer receives a replacement product from Cisco and
(ii)  returns to Cisco an ineligible Unauthorized Product (one that has not been inspected or correctly licensed) instead of the actual defective Cisco product for which the advanced replacement product was provided.
4.     Cisco encourages customers to check the source and quality of the products they purchase, in order to reduce risks of purchasing and using Illegally Imported Products and Unauthorized Products in their networks (that is, unknown origin may mean unknown quality and hence unknown risks). In addition, Cisco encourages customers to check eligibility of Unauthorized Products for Cisco support and the validity of the applicable software licenses for those products

Section 5 - Third party repair sources: Cisco warranty and service support implications
Introduction
Cisco Systems® holds ISO 9000 and ISO 14000 certifications and strives to ensure the highest levels of product quality and customer satisfaction. To maintain its ISO certifications and provide high customer satisfaction, Cisco® contracts with qualified service repair companies worldwide. These companies (as subcontractors to Cisco) provide support in connection with Cisco warranty and service contract obligations.
Cisco employs the authorized repair companies to evaluate, repair, or replace parts or products, including field replaceable units (FRUs). An FRU is any component or subassembly of an item, or unit of a product manufactured by Cisco that can be replaced in the field. Examples would be chassis, pluggable modules, power supplies, and product-specific printed circuit board assemblies such as line cards.
Cisco authorized service repair partners receive specialized, ongoing training to competently provide product evaluation, refurbishment, and testing support. Cisco grants these partners access to certified replacement parts, and to the following:
Engineering Change Order (ECO) processes for latest updates
Test plans and procedures developed by Cisco engineers
Dynamic burn-in chambers and profiles
Fully integrated, automated, and operational test stations in support of the test plan, including all commercial test systems required
Auto test scripts, which control the testing process and data gathering
Test methodologies such as those specific to a product family and defined by Cisco, which would include tests for structural integrity, functionality, optical parametrics, and live traffic.
A quality assurance program that verifies product functions and reliability without compromising customers’ needs.
Third-party repair sources
Cisco authorized service repair partners (as previously described) should be distinguished from third-party repair businesses who offer their own brand of repair or other services for Cisco products. The third-party repair businesses referenced here should also be distinguished from Cisco authorized channel partners and resellers per Cisco Channel Partner Program.
Cisco does not “certify,” “authorize,” “endorse,” or “recommend” any third-party service repair businesses and cannot validate or otherwise comment upon their competencies, capabilities, or qualifications.
Cisco does not offer or provide any replacement or spare parts to such third-party service repair businesses.
Cisco does not offer or provide any warranty for products that are repaired by such third-party service repair businesses. Customers who elect to use such third-party repair sources do so at their own risk.
All Cisco software license grants are to end-user purchasers and are non-transferable. See Cisco Software End User License Agreement terms (EULA) at https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html, including the "General Limitations" provisions that prohibit the transfer, assignment, or sublicense of the license to any other person, or to use the Software on unauthorized or secondhand Cisco equipment.
When a customer reports a product fault or defect and Cisco determines that the fault or defect can be traced to the use of a third-party repair business, Cisco retains the right to withhold support under warranty or a Cisco support program, such as SMARTnet® services.
Additionally, Cisco reserves the right to charge the customer for services provided to the customer when Cisco determines, after having provided such services, that the root cause of the defective product was due to a third party vendor or a third-party-vendor-supplied product. If Cisco concludes that the fault or defect is not attributable to the use of a third party repair company, Cisco will continue to provide support for the affected product under warranty or covered by a Cisco support program.
Customers who choose to install or use third-party components including, but not limited to, memory, cables, or pluggable modules, do so at their own risk. For more information about Cisco’s Third-Party Component policy, see https://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/prod_warranties_item09186a00800b5594.html.
For more information about Cisco’s Limited Warranty, see https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/warranty-listing.html.
Section 6 – Third party components
Cisco Guideline:
Third party components support
The Cisco guideline for support and warranty services for the use of third-party memory, cables, gigabit interface controllers (GBICs), filters, or other non-Cisco components is as follows:
When a customer reports a product fault or defect and Cisco believes the fault or defect can be traced to the use of third-party memory products, cables, GBIC's, filters, or other non-Cisco components by a customer or reseller, then, at Cisco's discretion, Cisco may withhold support under warranty or a Cisco support program such as SMART Net Total care™ service.
When a product fault or defect occurs in the network, and Cisco concludes that the fault or defect is not attributable to the use of third-party memory, cables, GBICs, filters, or other non-Cisco components installed by a customer or reseller, Cisco will continue to provide support for the affected product under warranty or covered by a Cisco support program.
The nature of the defect or error is the key to determining Cisco support obligations.
Cisco also reserves the right to charge the customer for services provided to the customer when Cisco determines, after having provided such services, that the root cause of the defective product was caused by a third-party vendor supplied product.
    This Policy Document follows Cisco Internal Policy as detailed in EDCS# 12001054.
