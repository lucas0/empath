Overview of AppNav-XE
The AppNav-XE feature facilitates intelligent distribution of traffic flows to WAAS devices. WAAS devices are used for WAN optimization.
AppNav-XE reduces dependency on the intercepting router by distributing traffic among WAAS devices for optimization using a class and policy mechanism. You can use WAAS nodes (WNs) to optimize traffic based on sites and/or applications. The AppNav-XE solution can scale up to available capacity by taking into account WAAS device utilization as it distributes traffic among nodes. The solution provides high availability of optimization capacity by monitoring node overload; and by providing configurable failure and overload policies.

Note
The AppNav-XE feature was already available on Cisco IOS XE platforms before it was introduced to Cisco SD-WAN in Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2. For more information, see Configuration Guide for AppNav-XE on the Cisco CSR 1000V Series and Cisco ASR 1000 Series.
Topology Example

The image above shows an example of Cisco SD-WAN deployment with AppNav-XE. The Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices at the data center and branches are enabled with the AppNav-XE feature and form an AppNav cluster with WAAS nodes.
Benefits of AppNav-XE
Enables enterprises to expand services efficiently and cost-effectively
Supports the use of flexible policy definitions
Integrated with Cisco SD-WAN network services, which eliminates the need for any additional hardware
Intelligently redirects new flows based on the load on each service node. This also includes the load on individual L7 application accelerators
For flows that don't require any optimization, service nodes can inform the AppNav Controller to directly pass-through the packets, thus minimizing the latency and resource utilization
Has minimal impact to traffic when adding or removing service nodes
Supports VRFs, so that the VRF information is preserved when traffic returns from a service node
Supports optimization of asymmetric flows through AppNav controller groups

Note
An asymmetric flow is when the traffic in one direction goes through one AppNav Controller and the return traffic goes through a different AppNav Controller; but both AppNav Controllers redirect the traffic to the same service node.
Provides inter-router high availability to keep traffic flows uninterrupted, where if one router goes down, the traffic can be re-routed to a different router within the AppNav Controller group.
Components of AppNav-XE
AppNav Cluster: A group of all AppNav controllers and WAAS nodes at a site. Typically, each enterprise site, such as branch and data center, has an AppNav cluster.
AppNav Controller: A device that intercepts network traffic and, based on an AppNav policy, distributes that traffic to one or more WAAS nodes (WNs) for optimization. The device in this context is a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device running AppNav-XE.
WAAS Nodes: Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) nodes or service nodes are WAAS optimization engines or vWAAS instances that optimize and accelerate traffic based on the optimization policies configured on the device.

Note
WAAS service nodes are outside the scope of this document.
WAAS Central Manager (WCM): WCM devices host WCM, a Web-based interface that allows you to configure, manage, and monitor AppNav controllers and WAAS nodes in your network. In AppNav-XE for Cisco SD-WAN, WCM communicates with Cisco vManage, which is the NMS used to configure Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. Cisco vManage then pushes the AppNav-XE configuration to the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. However, WAAS nodes in an AppNav cluster still receive their configuration through WCM. Monitoring of WAAS nodes and AppNav-XE on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices is done directly through WCM.
Cisco vManage: This is the primary management system in Cisco SD-WAN. Therefore, WCM sends the AppNav-XE configuration to Cisco vManage, which in turn pushes it to the AppNav-XE controllers.
Supported Platforms
The following platforms support AppNav-XE for Cisco SD-WAN.
Cisco 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers
Cisco 4000 Series Integrated Services Routers
Cisco Cloud Services Router 1000V Series
C8500-12X4QC and C8500-12X Series Aggregation Services Routers
C8300 Series Integrated Services Routers
Managing AppNav-XE in Cisco SD-WAN
The AppNav-XE feature was already supported on IOS XE platforms. However, starting from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2, the feature is extended to Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN platforms. Note that for this feature to work, Cisco vManage should be running Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.1.1 or later.
AppNav-XE in SD-WAN versus non-SD-WAN Environments
How AppNav-XE is configured in SD-WAN is different from how it’s configured in non-SD-WAN environments. The major difference is the involvement of Cisco vManage, which acts as an intermediary between WCM and AppNav-XE controllers, to push the AppNav policy configuration to Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices act as AppNav-XE controllers.
The following image shows the differences in the deployment of AppNav-XE in SD-WAN and non-SD-WAN environments.
Figure 2. Comparison: AppNav-XE in SD-WAN versus non SD-WAN Environments
AppNav-XE in IOS XE: The WCM GUI directly communicates with the AppNav Controller (ANC) and the WAAS Nodes (WN) in the AppNav cluster to push the configuration.
AppNav-XE in IOS XE SD-WAN: The major difference is in terms of how the AppNav policy configuration is pushed to the AppNav Controllers (ANC). Here, the feature is configured through both WCM GUI and Cisco vManage. You continue to configure the AppNav-XE feature in WCM. WCM then sends the configuration to Cisco vManage, which in turn pushes the configuration to AppNav controllers. The communication between WCM and Cisco vManage is achieved through registering WCM as a third-party controller with Cisco vManage. WCM still directly sends the configuration to the WAAS nodes.
