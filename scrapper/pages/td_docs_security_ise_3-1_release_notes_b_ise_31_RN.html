Communications, Services, and Additional Information
Introduction to Cisco Identity Services Engine
Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) is a security policy management platform that provides secure access to network resources. Cisco ISE allows enterprises to gather real-time contextual information from networks, users, and devices. An administrator can then use this information to make proactive governance decisions by creating access control policies for the various network elements, including access switches, wireless controllers, Virtual Private Network (VPN) gateways, 5GaaS networks, and data center switches. Cisco ISE acts as the policy manager in the Cisco TrustSec solution and supports TrustSec software-defined segmentation.
Cisco ISE is available on secure network server appliances with different performance characterizations, and also as software that can be run on a virtual machines (VMs). Note that you can add more appliances to a deployment for better performance.
Cisco ISE has a scalable architecture that supports standalone and distributed deployments, but with centralized configuration and management. It also enables the configuration and management of distinct personas and services, thereby giving you the ability to create and apply services, where needed, in a network, but operate the Cisco ISE deployment as a complete and coordinated system.
For detailed Cisco ISE ordering and licensing information, see the Cisco Identity Services Engine Ordering Guide.
For information on monitoring and troubleshooting the system, see the "Monitoring and Troubleshooting Cisco ISE" section in the Cisco Identity Services Engine Administrator Guide.
What is New in Cisco ISE, Release 3.1?
This section lists the new and changed features in Cisco ISE 3.1.

Note
Cisco ISE 3.1 OVA, ISO, and upgrade bundle files have been replaced on the Software Download site. For more information, see Cisco ISE 3.1 Files Replaced on Software Download Site.
Android Settings for Native Supplicant Profile
Android settings are added for native supplicant profile. You can select one of the following options for Certificate Enrollment Protocol:
Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST)
Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP)
If you choose the EST protocol, Cisco ISE will ask for additional password inputs from Android users while issuing certificates.
For more information, see "Native Supplicant Profile Settings" in the Chapter "Compliance" in the Cisco ISE Administrator Guide, Release 3.1.
Enhancements in Audit Logs
The following audit logs have been enhanced to include more details about relevant events:
Posture audit logs now include information regarding:
Creation and deletion of posture policies.
Changes made to existing posture policies, such as changes in fields such as Conditions, Rule Name, and so on.
Addition, deletion, or modification in posture configurations such as Conditions, Remediation Actions, Requirements, and so on.
RBAC audit logs now include information regarding creation and deletion of existing menu access and data access content.
Network Access and Admin Users audit logs now include information regarding creation, edition, and deletion of Network Access and Admin Users.
Posture State Synchronization
You can configure AnyConnect to probe Cisco ISE at specified intervals when the posture status is not compliant. This helps prevent a client from being stuck in pending state.
The posture state synchronization is supported for Windows, Linux, and MacOS clients.
For more information, see "Posture State Synchronization" in the Chapter "Compliance" in the Cisco ISE Administrator Guide, Release 3.1.
Obtain Configuration Backup Using Cisco Support Diagnostics Connector
You can use Cisco Support Diagnostics Connector to trigger configuration backup and upload the backup files to the Cisco Support Diagnostics folder. After uploading the backup files to the Cisco Support Diagnostics folder, you can delete the backup files from the Cisco ISE local disk. To use this feature, you must enable smart licensing and Cisco Support Diagnostics in Cisco ISE.
For more information, see "Obtain Configuration Backup Using Cisco Support Diagnostics Connector" in the Chapter "Troubleshoot" in the Cisco ISE Administrator Guide, Release 3.1.
Configuration of Authorization Result Alarm
You can configure alarms based on the results of authorization policies. This allows you to monitor the impact of any networking, infrastructure, or application changes on endpoint authorizations. You can define the scope of your alarms by choosing specific Network Device Groups (NDGs). For each NDG you choose, a new Authorization Result alarm is created.
You can filter the authorization logs to be monitored for an alarm by choosing specific authorization profiles and Security Group Tags (SGTs). Only endpoints that have met authorization policy sets with the specified authorization profiles and SGTs are monitored by the alarm.
For more information, see "Configure Authorization Result Alarm" in the Chapter "Troubleshoot" in the Cisco ISE Administrator Guide, Release 3.1.
Configuration of Preferred Domain Controllers
You can specify the domain controllers that you want to use in case of domain failover. If a domain fails, Cisco ISE compares the priority scores of the domain controllers that are added to the preferred list and selects the one with the highest priority score. If that domain controller is offline or is not reachable because of an issue, the next one in the preferred list with the highest priority score is used. If all the domain controllers in the preferred list are down, a domain controller outside the list is selected based on the priority score. When the domain controller that was used before the failover is restored, Cisco ISE switches back to that domain controller.
For more information, see "Configure Preferred Domain Controllers" in the Chapter "Asset Visibility" in the Cisco ISE Administrator Guide, Release 3.1.
Context Visibility Enhancements
In the Export Endpoints dialog box, you can now check the Importable Only check box if you want to export only the attributes that can be imported to Cisco ISE without any modification to the CSV file. Using this option prevents the need to modify the columns or metadata in the exported CSV file before importing it to Cisco ISE.
While using the Quick Filter or Advanced Filter option, you can use the Export Filtered option to export only the filtered endpoints.
For more information, see "Export Endpoints Using CSV File" in the Chapter "Asset Visibility" in the Cisco ISE Administrator Guide, Release 3.1.
Full Upgrade and Split Upgrade Options Added to Cisco ISE GUI
In the Administration > System > Upgrade> Upgrade Selection window, you can choose one of the following options based on your requirements:
Full Upgrade: Full upgrade is a multistep process that enables a complete upgrade of your Cisco ISE deployment sequentially. This upgrades all the nodes in parallel and in lesser time compared to the split upgrade process. Because all the nodes are upgraded parallelly, services will be down during the upgrade process.
Split Upgrade: Split upgrade is a multistep process that enables the upgrade of your Cisco ISE deployment while allowing services to remain available during the upgrade process for users. With the split upgrade option, you will be able to choose the nodes to be upgraded.
For more information, see "Upgrade a Cisco ISE Deployment from the GUI" in the Chapter "Upgrade Method" in Cisco Identity Services Engine Upgrade Journey, Release 3.1.
Cisco ISE on Amazon Web Services
You can launch a Cisco ISE instance on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform using a Cloud Formation Template (CFT) or an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
For more information, see the Chapter "Install Cisco ISE with AmazonWeb Services" in Cisco ISE Installation Guide, Release 3.1.
Virtual Appliance Licenses
Cisco ISE Release 3.1 and later supports the ISE VM license, which replaces the VM Small, VM Medium, and VM Large licenses that were supported in releases prior to Release 3.1. The new ISE VM license covers the Cisco ISE VM nodes in both on-premises and cloud deployments.
For more information, see "Cisco ISE Licenses" in the Chapter "Licensing" in the Cisco ISE Administrator Guide, Release 3.1.
Download or Upload Files from Local Disk
You can easily add, download, or delete the files that are used for local disk management.
For more information, see "Download and Upload Files from Local Disk" in the Chapter "Maintain and Monitor" in the Cisco ISE Administrator Guide, Release 3.1.
MacOS Versions in Posture Policy Configurations
In Cisco ISE 3.0 and earlier, you could configure posture policies and requirements with minor MacOS versions such as MacOS 11.1, MacOS 11.2, and so on. In Cisco ISE 3.1, you can only choose major MacOS versions such as MacOS 11 (All) to configure posture policies and requirements.
When you upgrade to Cisco ISE 3.1, any posture condition that includes a minor MacOS version is automatically updated to the corresponding major MacOS version. For example, a posture condition that was configured for MacOS 11.1 will be updated to MacOS 11 (All).
OpenAPI Service
OpenAPIs are REST APIs based on HTTPS operating over port 443. From Cisco ISE 3.1 onwards, newer APIs are available in the OpenAPI format. For more information on Cisco ISE OpenAPIs, see https://<ise-ip>/api/swagger-ui/index.html.
The following OpenAPIs have been introduced in Cisco ISE 3.1:
Repository Management
Configuration Data Backup and Restore
Certificate Management
Policy Management
RADIUS Policy
TACACS+ Policy
For more information, see "Enable API Service" in the Chapter "Basic Setup" in Cisco ISE Administrator Guide, Release 3.1.

For more information, see the Chapter "Compliance" in Cisco ISE Administrator Guide, Release 3.1.
ERS Service Auto Enabled on VMware Cloud Environment
The External RESTful Services (ERS) API service is enabled by default when the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) version of Cisco ISE is deployed on a VMware Cloud environment. This helps in easy integration of Cisco ISE with other Cisco products and third-party applications, without the need to enable the ERS service from the Cisco ISE GUI.
For more information, see "Enable API Service" in the Chapter "Basic Setup" in the Cisco ISE Administrator Guide, Release 3.1.
pxGrid Client Auto Approval API
pxGrid can be used to share context-sensitive information from the Cisco ISE session directory with other network systems such as Cisco ISE ecosystem partner systems and other Cisco platforms. The pxGrid Client Auto Approval API can be used to:
Enable automatic approval of certificate-based connection requests from new pxGrid clients. Enable this option only when you trust all the clients in your environment.
Enable username or password-based authentication for the pxGrid clients. When this option is enabled, pxGrid clients cannot be automatically approved. A pxGrid client can register itself with the pxGrid controller by sending the username through a REST API. The pxGrid controller generates a password for the pxGrid client during client registration. An administrator can approve or deny the connection request.
For more information about the PxGrid Client Auto Approval API, see the “pxGrid Settings” section in the ERS SDK. You can access the ERS SDK with the following URL:
https://<ISE-Admin-Node>:9060/ers/sdk

Note
Only users with ERS Admin role can access the ERS SDK.
Configuration of Maximum Password Attempts for Active Directory Account
You can configure the badPwdCount attribute to prevent Active Directory account lockout due to too many bad password attempts. Before authenticating the user, Cisco ISE compares the maximum bad password attempts configured in Cisco ISE with the current value of the badPwdCount attribute on Active Directory. When the maximum bad password attempts configured in Cisco ISE is equal to the value of the badPwdCount attribute, the authentication is dropped and not sent to Active Directory.
For more information, see "Configure Maximum Password Attempts for AD Account" in the Chapter "Asset Visibility" in the Cisco ISE Administrator Guide, Release 3.1.
Handle Random and Changing MAC Addresses with Mobile Device Management Servers
As a privacy measure, mobile devices and some desktop operating systems increasingly use random and changing MAC addresses for each SSID that they connect to. In Cisco ISE, you can now work around this problem by configuring Cisco ISE to use a unique device identifier called GUID instead of MAC addresses. When an endpoint enrolls with a Mobile Device Management (MDM) server, the MDM server sends a certificate with a GUID value to the endpoint. The endpoint uses this certificate for authentication with Cisco ISE. Cisco ISE receives the GUID for the endpoint from the certificate. All communications between Cisco ISE and the MDM server now use the GUID to identify the endpoint, ensuring accuracy and consistency between the two systems.
For more information, see "Handle Random and Changing MAC Addresses With Mobile Device Management Servers" in the Chapter "Secure Wired Access" in Cisco ISE Administrator Guide, Release 3.1
MAC Randomization for BYOD
Android and iOS devices increasingly use random and changing MAC addresses for each SSID that they connect to. Cisco ISE and MDM systems see different MAC addresses for the same device depending on which SSID they use to connect to the service. Therefore, a unique identifier is generated by the Cisco ISE Provisioning service to identify these endpoints.
For more information, see "MAC Randomization for BYOD" in the Chapter "Basic Setup" in Cisco ISE Administrator Guide, Release 3.1.
Endpoint API Enhancement
The logicalProfileName filter can be used to get endpoints that belong to a specific Logical Profile. The supported operator for logicalProfileNamefilter is EQ (equal to). The syntax to invoke the API with this filter is:
/ers/config/endpoint?filter={filter name}.{operator}.{logical profile name}
For more information, see Cisco ISE API Reference Guide.
Posture Script Remediation
You can create and upload posture remediation scripts to Cisco ISE to resolve non-compliance issues in endpoints.
For more information, see "Add a Script Remediation" in the Chapter "Compliance" in Cisco ISE Administrator Guide, Release 3.1.
RHEL 8.2 Support
Cisco ISE runs on the Cisco Application Deployment Engine Operating System (ADEOS), which is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). For Cisco ISE 3.1, ADEOS is based on RHEL 8.2.
RHEL 8.2 supports the following VMware ESXi versions:
VMware ESXi 6.5
VMware ESXi 6.5 U1
VMware ESXi 6.5 U2
VMware ESXi 6.5 U3
VMware ESXi 6.7
VMware ESXi 6.7 U1
VMware ESXi 6.7 U2
VMware ESXi 6.7 U3
VMware ESXi 7.0
VMware ESXi 7.0 U1
VMware ESXi 7.0 U2
For more information, see the Chapter "Overview" in Cisco Identity Services Engine Upgrade Journey, Release 3.1.
SAML-Based Admin Login
SAML-based admin login adds a single sign on capability to Cisco ISE using the SAML 2.0 standard. You can use an external Identity Provider such as Okta or any Identity Provider that implements SAML 2.0.
For more information, see "SAML-based Admin Login" in the Chapter "‘Asset Visibility" in Cisco ISE Administrator Guide, Release 3.1.
Specific License Reservation
Specific License Reservation is a smart licensing method that helps you manage your smart licensing when your organization's security requirements do not allow a persistent connection between Cisco ISE and the Cisco Smart Software Manager (CSSM). Specific License Reservation allows you to reserve specific license entitlements on a Cisco ISE node.
You can create a Specific License Reservation by defining the type and number of licenses you need to reserve, and then activate the reservation on a Cisco ISE node. The Cisco ISE node on which you register and enable the reservation then tracks license usage and enforces license consumption compliance.
For more information, see "Specific License Reservation" in the Chapter "Licensing" in Cisco ISE Administrator Guide, Release 3.1.
Upgrade to pxGrid 2.0
From Cisco ISE Release 3.1, all pxGrid connections must be based on pxGrid 2.0. pxGrid 1.0-based (XMPP-based) integrations will cease to work on Cisco ISE from Release 3.1 onwards.
pxGrid Version 2.0, which is based on WebSockets, was introduced in Cisco ISE Release 2.4. We recommend that you plan and upgrade your other systems to pxGrid 2.0-compliant versions in order to prevent potential disruptions, if any, to integrations.
For more information, see the Chapter "pxGrid" in Cisco ISE Administrator Guide, Release 3.1.

Note
The output of show application status ise command reflects only the status of pxGrid 1.0 services.
Zero Touch Provisioning
Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) refers to the uninterrupted provisioning mechanism that helps to automate Cisco ISE installation, infrastructure service enablement, patching, and hot patching without manual intervention.
For more information, see "Zero Touch Provisioning" in the Chapter "Additional Installation Information" in Cisco ISE Installation Guide, Release 3.1.
Cisco Secure Access Control System-to-Cisco ISE Migration Tool
The Cisco Secure Access Control System-to-Cisco ISE Migration Tool is not supported for Cisco ISE 3.1 and later. End-of-Life dates have been announced for Cisco Secure Access Control System. For more information, see End-of-Life Notice.

Known Limitations and Workarounds
This section provides information about the various known limitations and the corresponding workarounds.
Incorrect Smart Licensing Consumption Reports
After you upgrade to Cisco ISE Release 3.1 Patches 5 or 6, if your smart licensing configuration uses the connection methods Direct HTTPS or HTTPS Proxy, you may witness incorrect compliance statuses being reported. Incorrect license consumption counts may be reported due to a communication error between Cisco ISE and CSSM.
To troubleshoot the communication error, in the Licensing window of the Cisco ISE administration portal, deregister and then reregister your smart licensing.
CSCwc74531 Hot Patch Affects Cisco ISE Application Server
Installing the CSCwc74531 hot patch affects the Cisco ISE application server if all the following conditions are met:
You installed Cisco ISE Release 3.1 using the ise-3.1.0.518.SPA.x86_64.iso file
You are running Cisco ISE Release 3.1 Patch 3 or earlier
You have applied Log4j hot patch
In this scenario, reach out to Cisco TAC for node recovery.
We recommend that you upgrade to Patch 5 or later versions instead of applying the Log4j or CSCwc74531 hot patches while using Cisco ISE Release 3.1 Patch 3 or earlier.
If you have installed Cisco ISE Release 3.1 using the ise-3.1.0.518b.SPA.x86_64.iso file, this limitation does not affect your Cisco ISE.
Antimalware Condition for ClamWin Products
You might see the following error message while trying to add an antimalware condition for ClamWin Pty Ltd vendor:
class com.cisco.cpm.posture.exceptions.PostureException:Check am_linux_def_v4_ClamWinPtyLtd is not found
When multiple ClamWin products with 0.x version are listed in the Baseline Condition tab, if you select any of those products and configure an antimalware condition, the above error message might be displayed.
In such a scenario, you must run the posture feed update one or more times to remove the multiple entries for 0.x version.
As a workaround, you can select a product from the Advanced Condition tab and configure an antimalware condition for ClamWin Pty Ltd vendor.
Authentication Might Fail for SNMP Users After Upgrade due to Wrong Hash Value
If you are upgrading from Cisco ISE 2.7 or earlier release to Cisco ISE 3.1, you must reconfigure the settings for SNMP users after the upgrade. Otherwise, authentication might fail for SNMP users because of wrong hash value.
Use the following commands to reconfigure the settings for SNMPv3 users:
no snmp-server user <snmp user> <snmp version> <auth password> <priv password>
snmp-server user <snmp user> <snmp version> <auth password> <priv password>

Upgrade Information
Upgrading to Release 3.1
You can directly upgrade to Release 3.1 from the following Cisco ISE releases:
2.6
2.7
3.0
If you are on a version earlier than Cisco ISE, Release 2.6, you must first upgrade to one of the releases listed above, and then upgrade to Release 3.1.
We recommend that you upgrade to the latest patch in the existing version before starting the upgrade.
Cisco ISE 3.1 has parity with 2.6 Patch 9, 2.7 Patch 4, and 3.0 Patch 2.
Upgrade Packages
For information about the upgrade packages and the supported platforms, see Cisco ISE Software Download.
Upgrade Procedure Prerequisites
Run the Upgrade Readiness Tool (URT) before the upgrade to check whether the configured data can be upgraded to the required Cisco ISE version. Most upgrade failures occur because of data upgrade issues. The URT validates the data before the actual upgrade and reports the issues, if any. The URT can be downloaded from the Cisco ISE Download Software Center.
We recommend that you install all the relevant patches before beginning the upgrade.
For more information, see the Cisco Identity Services Engine Upgrade Guide.
Telemetry
After installation, when you log in to the Admin portal for the first time, the Cisco ISE Telemetry banner is displayed. Using this feature, Cisco ISE securely collects nonsensitive information about your deployment, network access devices, profiler, and other services that you are using. This data will be used to provide better services and more features in the forthcoming releases. By default, telemetry is enabled. To disable or modify the account information, choose Administration > Settings > Network Settings Diagnostics > Telemetry. The account is unique for each deployment. Each admin user need not provide it separately.
It may take up to 24 hours after the Telemetry feature is disabled for Cisco ISE to stop sharing telemetry data.
Types of data collected include Product Usage Telemetry and Cisco Support Diagnostics.
Cisco Support Diagnostics
The Cisco Support Diagnostics Connector enables Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) and Cisco support engineers to obtain support information on the deployment through the primary administration node. By default, this feature is disabled. See the Cisco Identity Services Engine Administrator Guide for instructions on how to enable this feature.
Cisco ISE Live Update Portals
Cisco ISE Live Update portals help you to automatically download the Supplicant Provisioning wizard, AV/AS support (Compliance Module), and agent installer packages that support client provisioning and posture policy services. These live update portals are configured in Cisco ISE during the initial deployment to retrieve the latest client provisioning and posture software directly from Cisco.com to the corresponding device using Cisco ISE.
If the default Update portal URL is not reachable and your network requires a proxy server, configure the proxy settings. In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > System > Settings > Proxy before you access the Live Update portals. If proxy settings allow access to the profiler, posture, and client-provisioning feeds, access to a Mobile Device Management (MDM) server is blocked because Cisco ISE cannot bypass the proxy services for MDM communication. To resolve this, you can configure the proxy services to allow communication to the MDM servers. For more information on proxy settings, see the "Specify Proxy Settings in Cisco ISE" section in the Cisco Identity Services Engine Administrator Guide.
Client Provisioning and Posture Live Update Portals
You can download Client Provisioning resources from:
In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Work Centers > Posture > Settings > Software Updates > Client Provisioning.

Cisco AI Endpoint Analytics
Cisco AI Endpoint Analytics is a solution on Cisco DNA Center that improves endpoint profiling fidelity. It provides fine-grained endpoint identification and assigns labels to various endpoints. Information gathered through deep-packet inspection, and probes from sources such as Cisco ISE, Cisco SD-AVC, and network devices, is analyzed for endpoint profiling.
Cisco AI Endpoint Analytics also uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning capabilities to intuitively group endpoints with similar attributes. IT administrators can review such groups and assign labels to them. These endpoint labels are then available in Cisco ISE if your Cisco ISE account is connected to on-premises Cisco DNA Center.
These endpoint labels from Cisco AI Endpoint Analytics can be used by Cisco ISE administrators to create custom authorization policies. You can provide the right set of access privileges to endpoints or endpoint groups through such authorization policies.
Install a New Patch
For instructions on how to apply the patch to your system, see the "Cisco ISE Software Patches" section in the Cisco Identity Services Engine Upgrade Journey.
For instructions on how to install a patch using CLI, see the "Patch Install" section in the Cisco Identity Services Engine CLI Reference Guide.

Note
If you have installed a hot patch on Cisco ISE 3.1, you must roll back the hot patch before installing a patch. Otherwise, the services might not be started due to integrity check security issue.
Caveats
The Caveats section includes the bug ID and a short description of the bug. For details on the symptoms, conditions, and workaround for a specific caveat, use the Cisco Bug Search Tool (BST). The bug IDs are sorted alphanumerically.

Note
The Open Caveats sections lists the open caveats that apply to the current release and might apply to releases earlier than Cisco ISE 3.1. A caveat that is open for an earlier release and is still unresolved applies to all future releases until it is resolved.
The BST, which is the online successor to the Bug Toolkit, is designed to improve the effectiveness of network risk management and device troubleshooting. You can search for bugs based on product, release, or keyword, and aggregate key data such as bug details, product, and version. For more details on the tool, see the Help page located at http://www.cisco.com/web/applicat/cbsshelp/help.html.

New Features in Cisco ISE, Release 3.1 - Cumulative Patch 3
Support for Cisco pxGrid Cloud
Cisco ISE 3.1 patch 3 supports Cisco pxGrid Cloud. Cisco pxGrid Cloud is a new Cisco cloud offer that extends pxGrid, ERS and OpenAPI access to cloud-based applications. To allow connectivity between a Cisco ISE deployment and Cisco pxGrid Cloud, pxGrid Cloud service must be enabled on one or more pxGrid nodes in the Cisco ISE deployment. For more information on Cisco pxGrid Cloud, see Cisco pxGrid Cloud Solution Guide.
Automatic Renewal of OSCP Certificates
From Cisco ISE Release 3.1 Cumulative Patch 2 onwards, the following rules are applicable for the renewal of OCSP certificates:
For a multi-node Cisco ISE deployment, OCSP certificates are renewed automatically if you install the patch through the Cisco ISE GUI. If you install the patch through the Cisco ISE CLI, we recommend you to renew the OCSP certificate manually.
For a standalone Cisco ISE deployment, OCSP certificates are renewed automatically irrespective of whether you install the patch through the Cisco ISE GUI or the Cisco ISE CLI.
If you uninstall Patch 2, you have to renew the OCSP certificate manually.
Microsoft Intune Integration Changes Due to Microsoft Graph Updates
Microsoft is deprecating Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Graph and will not support Azure AD Graph-enabled integrations after June 30, 2022. You must migrate any integrations that use Azure AD Graph to Microsoft Graph. Cisco ISE typically uses the Azure AD Graph for integration with the endpoint management solution Microsoft Intune.
For more information on the migration from Azure AD Graph to Microsoft Graph, see the following resources:
Migrate Azure AD Graph apps to Microsoft Graph
Azure AD Graph to Microsoft Graph migration FAQ
Update your applications to use Microsoft Authentication Library and Microsoft Graph API
Cisco ISE Release 3.1 Patch 3 supports Microsoft Intune integrations that use Microsoft Graph. To avoid any disruption in the integration between Cisco ISE and Microsoft Intune, update your Cisco ISE to Cisco ISE Release 3.1 Patch 3. Then, update your Cisco ISE integration in Microsoft Azure to use Microsoft Graph instead of Azure AD Graph, before June 30, 2022. In Cisco ISE, you must update your Microsoft Intune integrations to update the Auto Discovery URL field—Replace https://graph.windows.net<Directory (tenant) ID> with https://graph.microsoft.com.
See Connect Microsoft Intune to Cisco ISE as a Mobile Device Management Server for more information on the configuration steps.
Opening TAC Support Cases in Cisco ISE
You can now open TAC Support Cases for Cisco ISE and other Cisco products from the Cisco ISE GUI.
For more information, see "Open TAC Support Cases in Cisco ISE" in the Chapter "Troubleshoot" in Cisco ISE Administrator Guide, Release 3.1.
SHA1 Ciphers Disabled by Default
From Cisco ISE Relase 3.1 Patch 2, SHA1 ciphers on port 443 are disabled by default.

Open Caveats in Cisco ISE Release 3.1 - Cumulative Patch 1
Caveat ID Number
Description
CSCwa09113
Single Byod Flow with Internal CA failing "12557 User Auth failed because OCSP status is unknown"
Cisco ISE 3.1 Files Replaced on Software Download Site
Cisco ISE 3.1 OVA, ISO, and upgrade bundle files have been replaced on the Cisco ISE Software Download site.
What Changes are Made?
The following bugs are resolved in this build:
CSCwa04370: ISE 3.1 shows incorrect outgoing interface for the default interface if two interfaces are configured with IP addresses and the default gateway references the subnet on eth1
CSCwa82553: ISE 3.1 default route is on the incorrect interface if bonding is configured
Option to skip ICMP, DNS, and NTP checks in the ZTP tool. For more information, see "Zero Touch Provisioning" in the Chapter "Additional Installation Information" in Cisco ISE Installation Guide, Release 3.1.

Note
The filenames of the new files will have "b" appended to the build number (for example, ise-3.1.0.518b.SPA.x86_64.iso).
If you want to import the SNS 3695 OVA template to the VMware vCenter content library, you can use the ISE-3.x.x.xxx-virtual-SNS3695-1800.ova template. This OVA template is similar to the ISE-3.x.x.xxx-virtual-SNS3695-2400.ova template, except for the reserved disk size, which has been reduced from 2400 GB to 1800 GB to workaround a limitation in the Vmware vCenter content library that prevents import of OVAs with disk size larger than 2 TB.
You will see the following ISE version in the output of show tech-support command:
ZTPBUNDLE
Existing Cisco ISE 3.1 patches will work fine with this build.
