Introduction
This sample configuration demonstrates how to set up a Layer 3 (L3) EtherChannel, without VLAN trunking, between a Cisco router and a Cisco Catalyst 6500 switch running Cisco IOS® System Software. EtherChannel can be called Fast EtherChannel (FEC) or Gigabit EtherChannel (GEC); the term depends on the speed of the interfaces or ports you use to form the EtherChannel. In this example, two Fast Ethernet ports from a Cisco router and a Catalyst 6500 switch have been bundled into a FEC. Throughout this document, the terms FEC, GEC, port channel, channel, and port group all refer to EtherChannel.
This document includes only the configuration files from the switch and router, and the output from the related sample show commands.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Before you attempt this configuration, ensure that you meet these requirements:
Catalyst 6500/6000 and 4500/4000 series switches running Cisco IOS Software:
Catalyst 6500/6000 and 4500/4000 series switches running Cisco IOS Software support both Layer 2 (L2) and L3 EtherChannel, with up to eight compatibly configured Ethernet interfaces on any module. All interfaces in each EtherChannel must be the same speed. All must be configured as either L2 or L3 interfaces.
EtherChannel load balancing can use either MAC addresses, IP addresses, or the TCP port numbers.
Note: The selected mode applies to all EtherChannels configured on the switch.
Catalyst 6500/6000 Cisco IOS Software Release 12.1E or later and Catalyst 4500/4000 Cisco IOS Software Release 12.1(8a)EW or later.
Cisco routers:
IP traffic distributes over the port channel interface while traffic from other routing protocols sends over a single link. Bridged traffic distributes on the basis of the L3 information in the packet. If the L3 information does not exist in the packet, the traffic sends over the first link.
A wide variety of Cisco routers support EtherChannel. To find a platform or version of code that supports EtherChannel on a Cisco router, use the Cisco Feature Navigator II (registered customers only) . A list of routers and Cisco IOS Software releases that support EtherChannel is found under the FEC feature.
For hardware and software requirements for EtherChannel on other Cisco products, refer to System Requirements to Implement EtherChannel on Catalyst Switches.
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
Catalyst 6500 switch running Cisco IOS Software Release 12.1(8b)E10
Cisco 7500 router running Cisco IOS Software Release 12.1(21)
The switch configuration in this document applies to any Catalyst 6500/6000 and any Catalyst 4500/4000 series switch running Cisco IOS Software.
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Note: Use of the write erase command cleared the configurations on all devices to ensure that they had a default configuration. Make sure to reload the devices after you issue the write erase command to flush all the nondefault configurations.
Conventions
Refer to Cisco Technical Tips Conventions for more information on document conventions.
Important Notes
If you initially issue the channel-group command under the physical interface, it automatically creates the port-channel interface. If you configured the port-channel interface before you channeled physical interfaces, remove the port-channel interface first. This is only relevant on Catalyst switches. The order of configuration changes on the 7500 router. You must configure the port-channel interface before you configure the channel group under the physical interface.
The order of configuration of a port channel in Catalyst 6500/6000 and 4500/4000 Cisco IOS Software is important. It is best to issue any switchport command before you issue the channel-group command in a physical interface.
When you issue the channel-group command prior to the switchport command on a physical interface (interface Gigabit Ethernet 1/1), the port-channel interface is created automatically and becomes a L3 interface. If you then issue the switchport command under the physical interface, the physical interface becomes a L2 interface. Also, the port-channel interface that you created earlier has no physical interface associated with it. Notice that the channel-group command is absent from under the physical interface. In this case, you must first issue the switchport command under the newly configured port-channel interface. Then, the physical port accepts the channel-group command again. In this case, the port channel has changed from a L3 interface to a L2 interface.
Consider, in contrast, if you issue the switchport command first on a physical interface and then add the channel-group command. In this case, the port-channel interface is automatically created and inherits all the configured switchport commands.
On a Catalyst 6500/6000 switch running Cisco IOS Software, all ports are L3 ports by default. On a Catalyst 4500/4000 switch running Cisco IOS Software, all ports are L2 ports by default.
