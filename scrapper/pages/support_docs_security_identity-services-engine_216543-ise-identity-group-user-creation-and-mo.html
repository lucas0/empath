Introduction
This document describes how to create and modify identity groups and users using Rest API which can be used for identity management automation. The procedure described in this chapter is based on sample standalone ISE deployment and Rest API Firefox Client (RESTED) in JSON format.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:
Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE)
REST API
JSON
Components Used
This document is not restricted to specific software and hardware versions and is only a sample configuration guide through REST API.
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Configure
These are the sample steps for operations through API which can be used as a reference to build your own calls.
1. Identity Group Creation 
Create an Identity Group with the help of the POST method.

URL for API Call:
https://<ISE IP>:9060/ers/config/identitygroup
The header for API Call:
HTTP 'Content-Type' Header:
application/json
HTTP 'Accept' Header:
application/json
JSON code for Identity Group Creation
{

      "IdentityGroup": {

            "name": "<Identity Group Name>",

            "description": "<Indentity Group Description>",

            "parent": "NAC Group:NAC:IdentityGroups:User Identity Groups"

      }

}
Example:
2. Identity Group Details Retrieval
Fetch the Identity Group details with the help ofGET method.
URL for API Call:
https://<ISE IP>:9060/ers/config/identitygroup?filter=name.CONTAINS.<Identity Group Name >
The header for API Call:
HTTP 'Content-Type' Header:
application/json
HTTP 'Accept' Header:
application/json
Example:
Note: ID (received in Identity Group details) is required to create users in this Identity Group.
3. User Creation
Create a User with the help ofPOST Method.
URL for API Call:
https://<ISE IP>:9060/ers/config/internaluser/
The header for API Call:
HTTP Content-Type Header:
application/json
HTTP Accept Header:
application/json
JSON code for User Creation:
{

  "InternalUser": {

    "name": "<username>",

    "email": "<emailid of user>",

    "enabled": true,

    "password": "<password>",

    "firstName": "<first name of user>",

    "lastName": "<Last name of user>",

    "changePassword": false,

    "identityGroups": "<ID of Identity Group, which user will be part of and can be received as described in step 2>",

    "expiryDateEnabled": false,

    "enablePassword": "<Enable Password>"

   

    }

}
Example:
4. User Details Retrieval
Fetch User details with the help of GET Method.
URL for API Call:
https://<ISE IP>:9060/ers/config/internaluser
Note: This URL Can be used to filter Users. User can be filtered using firstName, lastName, identityGroup, name, description, email, enabled.
This is recommended to filter user details with email ID as email id is unique for each user.
https://<ISE IP>:9060/ers/config/internaluser?filter=<name of the field used for filtering>.CONTAINS.<Value of the field for filtering>
The header for API Call:
HTTP Content-Type Header:
application/json
HTTP Accept Header:
application/json
Example:
Note:IDandNamereceived here is required to update the password or other information for a user.hrefURL will be used to update user information.
5. User Details Modification
Modify user password with the help ofPUT Method.
URL for API Call:
https://<ISE IP>:9060/ers/config/internaluser/<User ID received using  process described in step 4>
Above is href URL received using the process described in Step 4.
The header for API Call:
HTTP Content-Type Header:
application/json
HTTP Accept Header:
application/json
JSON code for User credential Modification:
{

  "InternalUser": {

    "id": "<ID of user which needs password change>",

    "name": " <user name which needs password change>",

  

    "password": "<New Password>",

    "enablePassword": "<New Enable Password>"

   

    }

}
Example:
Verify
To Verify identity groups navigate toAdministration > Identity Management > Groups > Identity Groups > User Identity Groupsin ISE GUI.
To Verify users navigate toAdministration > Identity Management > Identities > Usersin ISE GUI.
