Installing the Cisco ONS 15216 DWDM and CWDM Passive Optical Modules
Introduction
This document explains how to install and operate the Cisco ONS 15216 Dense Wave Division Multiplexing (DWDM) and Coarse wavelength division multiplexing (CWDM) passive optical modules.
The Cisco ONS 15216 DWDM and CWDM passive optical modules are used to build the optical network system.
The Cisco ONS 15216 DWDM and CWDM passive optical modules are 1 rack unit (RU) high and can be installed on:
19-inch (482.6 mm) or 23-inch (584.2 mm) EIA standard racks
19-inch (482.6 mm) IEC rack
600 mm x 600 mm or 600 mm x 300 mm ETSI rack.
The Cisco ONS 15216 DWDM and CWDM passive unit comprises of:
Rack Mounting Bracket
Cisco ONS 15216 4-Channel 100-GHz Add/Drop Module
Cisco ONS 15216 8-Channel CWDM Mux/Demux Module
Cisco ONS 15216 OSC Combiner/Splitter Module
Cisco ONS 15216 Optical Isolator Module
The non-volatile flash memory of the optical modules store inventory and insertion loss (IL) data of the optical paths. The stored data can be retrieved through the USB port of the optical module by connecting it to the transport node controller card (TNC) of the Cisco ONS 15454 M2 and Cisco ONS 15454 M6 shelf assembly.
Safety Information
Before you install, operate, or service the Cisco ONS 15216 DWDM and CWDM passive optical modules, you must read the Regulatory Compliance and Safety Information for Cisco Optical Transport Products document for important safety information and warning translations.
The Cisco ONS 15216 DWDM and CWDM passive optical modules are compliant with the GR 1089, UL60950 /CSA 22.2 No. 60950-00, and IEC 60950 standards.
Laser Radiation Emission Restrictions
The Class 1M Laser safety and warning label affixed to the Cisco ONS 15216 DWDM and CWDM passive optical modules indicate that the product should never be used or installed in an optical network with emissions higher than Class 1M.
Warning Class 1M laser radiation when open. Do not view directly with optical instruments. Statement 281
Laser Safety During Operation
Warning Invisible laser radiation may be emitted from disconnected fibers or connectors. Do not stare into beams or view directly with optical instruments. Statement 1051
Electrical Safety
The Cisco ONS 15216 DWDM and CWDM passive optical modules are optically and electrically passive and require no electrical connections. No electrostatic discharge (ESD) or other electrical safety considerations apply.
Rack Mounting Bracket
The optical modules are installed in the rack mounting bracket (15216-HD-EXT-PNL=). The rack mounting bracket is 19 inches (482.6-mm) wide and can be mounted on a 19-inch (482.6-mm) ANSI or an IEC equipment rack. However, by using a pair of external brackets (either straight or Z-shaped) it can also be mounted on a 23-inch (584.2-mm) ANSI, a 600 x 600 mm (23.6 x 23.6-inch), or a 600 x 300 mm (23.6 x 11.8-inch) equipment rack.
The rack mounting bracket has two slots. In each of these slots, either two single-slot units (4-Channel DWDM Add/Drop module, OSC Combiner/Splitter module, or 2-way Optical Isolator module) or one double-slot unit (8-Channel CWDM Mux/Demux module or 9-way Optical Isolator module) can be inserted. If the slots are empty, they can be covered by a blank-slot filler panel.
Diagram 1 in Figure 1 indicates the rack mounting bracket installed on a 19-inch ANSI or IEC equipment rack.
Diagram 2 in Figure 1 indicates the rack mounting bracket installed on a 23-inch ANSI equipment rack.
Diagram 3 in Figure 1 indicates the rack mounting bracket installed on an ETSI equipment rack.

  Ground Description
The unpainted surface between the rack mounting bracket and optical modules, and screws ensure proper grounding of the Cisco ONS 15216 DWDM and CWDM passive unit (see Figure 22). The rack mounting bracket, the straight external brackets, and the Z-shaped external brackets are unpainted and treated with conductive finishing.
Figure 22 Grounding of the Cisco ONS 15216 DWDM and CWDM Passive Optical Unit
    Fiber-Optic Connector Cleaning and Maintenance
Connector cleaning is required to maintain the performance of fiber-optic circuits. It is important that both the LC/UPC connector at the end of the fiber-optic cable and the mating bulkhead adapter on the front panel of the optical modules are clean before the connection is made.
Warning Invisible laser radiation may be emitted from disconnected fibers or connectors. Do not stare into beams or view directly with optical instruments. Statement 1051
The following warning applies to disposal of chemicals and other materials used to clean connectors and adapters:
Warning Ultimate disposal of this product should be handled according to all national laws and regulations. Statement 1040
Before installing the fiber-optic cable, always perform the cleaning procedure for cable connectors described in the following section. Whenever possible, inspect each connector before connecting it to the mating bulkhead adapter on the front panel.
The LC bulkhead adapters on the optical modules are less likely to get dirty if they are capped when not in use. Because the procedure for a thorough cleaning of these adapters is complicated, we recommend that you use a commercially available cleaning kit and closely follow the instructions included with the kit.
Customer Supplied Cleaning Materials
The Type A fiber-optic connector cleaners (for example, CLETOP reel) are recommended to clean the cable connectors, but are not supplied with the Cisco ONS 15216 DWDM and CWDM passive optical modules.
When cleaning a paired cable connector (bulkhead mating adapter), always clean the mating adapter first.
If properly maintained (only used with clean, defect-free fiber connectors and capped when not in use), the mating adapter would not require cleaning. However, if you suspect the adapter is dirty, clean it by using the CLETOP stick swab.
Note For multi-fiber cable assemblies, use specific cleaning tools or materials designed for the assembly type.
Clean the Bulkhead Mating Adapters
This procedure explains how to clean the bulkhead mating adapters.
Step 1 Read the manufacturer (cleaning cartridge) instructions to insert the cartridge cleaning tip into the mating adapter.
Step 2 Slide the lever on the cartridge to swipe the mating surface.
Note Always keep unused adapter ports and fiber connectors capped with a clean dust cap.
  Clean Fiber-Optic Cable Connectors
The tools required to clean fiber-optic cable connectors are:
Inspection microscope
Type A fiber-optic connector cleaner (CLETOP reel)
Optical swab
Optical receiver cleaning stick
Step 1 Using an inspection microscope, inspect each fiber connector for dirt, cracks, or scratches.
Step 2 Replace any damaged fiber connectors.
Note Replace all dust caps whenever the equipment is unused for 30 minutes or more.
Note Do not reuse optical swabs. Keep unused swabs away from work surfaces.
Step 3 Clean the fiber connectors with CLETOP reel:
a. Remove the dust cap from the fiber connector.
b. Press the lever down to open the shutter door. Each time you press the lever, you expose a clean wiping surface.
c. Insert the connector into the CLETOP cleaning cassette slot, rotate one quarter turn, and gently swipe downwards.
d. Use an inspection microscope to inspect each fiber connector for dirt, cracks, or scratches. If the connector is not clean, repeat Steps a to b .
e. Insert the fiber connector into the applicable adapter or attach a dust cap to the fiber connector.
Note If you must replace a dust cap on a connector, first verify that the dust cap is clean. To clean the dust cap, wipe the outside of the cap using a dry lint-free wipe and the inside of it using a CLETOP stick swab (14100400).
  Install and Route Fiber-Optic Cables
Warning Invisible laser radiation may be emitted from disconnected fibers or connectors. Do not stare into beams or view directly with optical instruments. Statement 1051
Caution When connecting an optical fiber patch cord between the optical module and the optical card ports in the Cisco ONS 15454, use the electrostatic discharge wristband supplied with the Cisco ONS 15454. Plug the wristband into the ESD jack on the lower right front side of the Cisco ONS 15454.
Note Always clean all fiber connectors thoroughly before making the connection with the mating adapter. Very small particles can permanently damage the end of the mating fiber inside the optical module, which makes regular cleaning imperative. For cleaning instructions see “Fiber-Optic Connector Cleaning and Maintenance” section.
Note The optical modules feature LC/UPC bulkhead adapters. Always use fiber-optic cables equipped with the corresponding (LC/UPC) connector type. Using any other type of connector results in damage to the connector or adapter, or both.
This procedure explains how to install and route fiber-optic cables.
Step 1 Place the LC/UPC cable connector in front of the corresponding bulkhead adapter on the front panel of the optical modules.
Step 2 Align the keyed ridge of the cable connector with the slot in the receiving adapter.
Step 3 Gently push the cable connector into the adapter until you hear a click, which indicates that the latching system is engaged.
Step 4 Route the fiber cables through the left or right side.
  Performance Monitoring
The optical modules use Optical Test Access Port (TAP) devices to enable monitoring in the fiber-optic network. The optical monitor ports (MON-TX and MON-RX) split a part of the optical signal from the main output ports of the optical module for monitoring purpose. An OSA (Optical Spectrum Analyzer (OSA) or PM (Power Meter) can be used for optical power monitoring and optical analysis.
Table 13 shows the manufacturer-specified TAP split ratios for the TAP coupler optical power in the optical module. The split ratio denotes the ratio of the TAP input signal to the output signal.
