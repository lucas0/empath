exec-timeout
To set the interval that the EXEC command interpreter waits until user input is detected, use the exec-timeout command in line configuration mode. To remove the timeout definition, use the no form of this command.
exec-timeout minutes [seconds]
no exec-timeout
Syntax Description
minutes
Integer that specifies the number of minutes. The default is 10 minutes.
seconds
(Optional) Additional time intervals in seconds.
Command Default
10 minutes
Command Modes
Line configuration (config-line)
Command History
Release
Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10.1a
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
If no input is detected during the interval, the EXEC facility resumes the current connection. If no connections exist, the EXEC facility returns the terminal to the idle state and disconnects the incoming session.
To specify no timeout, enter the no form of this command.
The following example shows how to set a time interval of 2 minutes, 30 seconds:
Device(config)# line console 0
Device(config-line)# exec-timeout 2 30
The following example shows how to set a time interval of 10 seconds:
Device(config)# line aux 0
Device(config-line)# exec-timeout 0 10
line
To identify a specific line for configuration and enter line configuration collection mode, use the line command in global configuration mode. To remove configuration from a specific line, use the no form of this command.
line { auto-consolidation | aux | con 0 | range | vty line-number }
no line { auto-consolidation aux | con 0 | range | vty line-number }
auto-consolidation
Enable or disable auto-consolidation of terminal lines.
aux
(Optional) Auxiliary EIA/TIA-232 DTE port. Must be addressed as relative line 0. The auxiliary port can be used for modem support and asynchronous connections.
con 0
Console 0 terminal line. The console port is DCE.
vty
Virtual terminal line for remote console access.
range
Range of lines with first line number and last line number.
line-number
Relative number of the virtual terminal line (or the first line in a contiguous group) that you want to configure when the line type is specified. Numbering begins with zero.
You can either configure a single line or a range.
Command Default
There is no default line.
Command Modes

The following example configuration shows how to disable auto-consolidation:
line auto-consolidation
To configure line parameters for the auxiliary port, enter the following:
line aux 0
The following example starts configuration for a range of lines:
line range 1 5
line con transport
To set transport output parameters for line console 0, use the transport command in line console 0 configuration mode. To remove transport parameters for line console 0, use the no form of this command.
transport { output [ aceron | all | lapb-ta | lat | mop | nasi | none | pad | rlogin | ssh | telnet | udptn | v120 ] }
