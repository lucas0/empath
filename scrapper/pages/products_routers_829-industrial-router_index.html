Features and capabilities
829 Industrial Integrated Services Routers are compact, ruggedized, Cisco IOS Software routers with support for integrated 4G LTE wireless WAN and wireless LAN capabilities.
They are:
Easily and rapidly deployable
Highly available, highly secure, and reliable
Designed for mobile vehicle communication in harsh environmental conditions
Designed to withstand hostile environments including shock, vibration, dust, humidity, and water sprayed from all directions
Designed to tolerate a wide temperature range
829 routers deliver enterprise-class features, including highly secure data, voice, and video communications to stationary and mobile network nodes across wired and wireless links. They can deliver enterprise-grade, wireline-like functionality such as:
Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN)
Quality of service (QoS) for cellular
Multi-VRF for cellular
Voice over LTE (VoLTE)
The 829 Industrial Integrated Services Router concurrently supports both 4G LTE for wireless WAN backhaul and Cisco dual-radio WLAN on the same platform. With the advantage of dual WLAN radio, the integrated access point can serve both as an access point and as a client to a wireless mesh network. This provides another source for WAN diversity, along with Gigabit Ethernet, serial, and cellular. The dual LTE model of the 829 further enhances WAN redundancy by providing concurrent connections to two LTE networks for mission critical services.
The router also supports Cisco IOx Software, providing an open, extensible environment for hosting additional operating systems and applications directly at the network edge. It can enhance other Cisco IoT System products across multiple industries, including transportation, manufacturing, electrical utilities, and others.
Secure, reliable connectivity for first responders and critical public infrastructure
Cisco’s FirstNet certified industrial routers are bringing greater situational awareness to public safety and improving the speed and efficiency of emergency response.
