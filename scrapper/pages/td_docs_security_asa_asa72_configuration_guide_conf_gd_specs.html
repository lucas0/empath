•Security Services Module Support
•VPN Specifications
Supported Platforms and Feature Licenses
This software version supports the following platforms; see the associated tables for the feature support for each model:
•ASA 5505, Table A-1
•ASA 5510, Table A-2
•ASA 5520, Table A-3
•ASA 5540, Table A-4
•ASA 5550, Table A-5
•PIX 515/515E, Table A-6
•PIX 525, Table A-7
•PIX 535, Table A-8
Note Items that are in italics are separate, optional licenses that you can replace the base license. You can mix and match licenses, for example, the 10 security context license plus the Strong Encryption license; or the 500 WebVPN license plus the GTP/GPRS license; or all four licenses together.

1 In routed mode, hosts on the inside (Business and Home VLANs) count towards the limit when they communicate with the outside (Internet VLAN), including when the inside initiates a connection to the outside as well as when the outside initiates a connection to the inside. Note that even when the outside initiates a connection to the inside, outside hosts are not counted towards the limit; only the inside hosts count. Hosts that initiate traffic between Business and Home are also not counted towards the limit. The interface associated with the default route is considered to be the outside Internet interface. If there is no default route, hosts on all interfaces are counted toward the limit. In transparent mode, the interface with the lowest number of hosts is counted towards the host limit. See the show local-host command to view host limits.
2 Although the maximum IPSec and WebVPN sessions add up to more than the maximum VPN sessions, the combined sessions should not exceed the VPN session limit. If you exceed the maximum VPN sessions, you can overload the security appliance, so be sure to size your network appropriately.
3 The concurrent firewall connections are based on a traffic mix of 80% TCP and 20% UDP, with one host and one dynamic translation for every four connections.

1 The CSC SSM licenses support up to 1000 users while the Cisco ASA 5540 Series appliance can support significantly more users. If you deploy CSC SSM with an ASA 5540 adaptive security appliance, be sure to configure the security appliance to send the CSC SSM only the traffic that should be scanned. For more information, see the "Determining What Traffic to Scan" section on page 22-9 for more information.
