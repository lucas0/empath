An online Video and Audio Conferencing platform for everyone...
What do you like best about the product?
The Webex has so many features: * It's very reliable and stable and also its audio and video call quality is more stable than other conferencing apps. * It allows us to easily share the screen and collaborate easily. * It has very good security and privacy features that are privileged to the host of the meeting he can decide who should enter the meeting and who should not.

One of the best alternatives for collaborative and meeting software
What do you like best about the product?
The best thing I like about WebEx app is its default dark theme user interface. The WebEx app has messaging services along with meeting services. In WebEx app we can easily share files and message our clients securely which saves lot of our time instead of emailing everytime. There is very low lag or latency in the meetings with Webex which is quite good. One more best thing I can change my device in mid meetings which is quite useful during internet connectivity issues.
