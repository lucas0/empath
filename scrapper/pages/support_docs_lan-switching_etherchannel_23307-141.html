Introduction
This document provides sample configurations for Fast EtherChannel (FEC), Inter-Switch Link (ISL), and 802.1Q trunking between a Catalyst 6500 switch that runs CatalystOS (CatOS) and a Cisco 7500 router. The results of each command are displayed as they are executed. Although a Catalyst 6000 switch is used in this configuration, you could substitute a Catalyst 4000 or Catalyst 5000 family switch that runs CatOS.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Ensure that you meet these requirements before you attempt this configuration:
Catalyst 6000 Series Switches
CatOS Release 5.1(1) CSX or later is required to support EtherChannel
Cisco 7000 or 7500 Series Routers
Cisco 7000 series routers with 7000 series Route Switch Processor (RSP7000) or Chassis Interface (RSP7000CI), or Cisco 7500 series routers with Fast Ethernet Interface Processors (FEIP) or Versatile Interface Processor (VIP2) port adapters
If you are using the PA-2FEISL port adapter, you must have hardware revision 1.2 or later.
Refer to Field Notice: *Expired* FN - 8791_11301999 - PA-2FEISL 2-Port Fast Ethernet ISL Replacement Recommendation for more information.
The encapsulation dot1Q native command was introduced in Cisco IOS® Software Release 12.1(3) T. This command changes the configuration.
See the Cisco 7500 802.1Q Configuration for Cisco IOS Software Releases Earlier than 12.1(3)T section of this document for more information.
Cisco Express Forwarding is enabled by default on Cisco 7500 series routers. However, Cisco Express Forwarding support for IP routing between IEEE 802.1Q VLANs was not available until Cisco IOS Software Release 12.2 and 12.2T. It is still possible to configure 802.1Q encapsulation in previous releases, but you must first issue the global no ip cef command to disable Cisco Express Forwarding.
When a 7500 series router is configured for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and FEC, support is currently unavailable for routing (MPLS » IP) packets that flow from the MPLS interface to the FEC interface. Therefore, it is not recommended that an MPLS and an FEC configuration coexist on a single router.
Cisco IOS Software Release 11.1(14)CA or later is required to support EtherChannel.
Cisco IOS Software Release 11.3(1)T (any plus feature set) or later is required to support ISL trunking.
Cisco IOS Software Release 12.0(1)T (any plus feature set) or later is required to support IEEE 802.1Q trunking.
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
Catalyst 6500 running CatOS version 5.5.14
Cisco 7500 running Cisco IOS Software Release 12.2.7b
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Important Notes
Keep in mind that Catalyst 4000 series switches do not support ISL trunking. In addition, some switching modules on Catalyst 5000 series switches are not EtherChannel capable. Issue the show port capabilities module command to determine whether a particular module is EtherChannel capable and what trunking encapsulation it supports.
There are certain guidelines for the configuration of EtherChannel and trunking. Always refer to the software documentation of your switch.
For example, if you were running software release 5.5.x on a Catalyst 5000, you would refer to the Software Configuration Guide (5.5) and carefully examine any configuration guidelines and restrictions in the Configuring Fast EtherChannel and Gigabit EtherChannel section.
EtherChannel
The FEC or Gigabit EtherChannel (GEC) feature allows multiple point-to-point links to be bundled into one logical link. The Catalyst 6000 supports a maximum of eight ports in full-duplex mode, which offers 1600 Mbps or 1.6 Gbps throughput for FEC and 16 Gbps for GEC. The Cisco 7500 series supports a maximum of four ports per FEC, for 800 Mbps. EtherChannel capability and performance is different, depending on the switch or router. Refer to System Requirements to Implement EtherChannel on Catalyst Switches for more information.
EtherChannel distributes traffic across all of the links and provides redundancy if one or more links fail. Refer to Understanding EtherChannel Load Balancing and Redundancy on Catalyst Switches for more information and sample configurations related to EtherChannel.
Refer to the EtherChannel page of Cisco Technical Support & Documentation for more information.
Trunking
Trunking is a way to carry traffic from multiple VLANs over a point-to-point link or an EtherChannel bundle between two devices. These are two ways in which Ethernet trunking can be implemented:
ISL (Cisco proprietary trunk encapsulation)
802.1Q (IEEE standard trunk encapsulation)
Refer to the VLAN Trunking Protocols page of Cisco Technical Support & Documentation for more information.
Conventions
Refer to Cisco Technical Tips Conventions for more information on document conventions.
Configure
In this section, you are presented with the information to configure the features described in this document.
Note: Use the Command Lookup Tool (registered customers only) to find more information on the commands used in this document.
These sample configurations show you how to do these things:
Configure two access ports for Workstation 1 in VLAN 1 and for Workstation 2 in VLAN 2 on the Catalyst 6500.
Configure the default gateway for Workstation 1 to be 10.10.10.1 /24 and for Workstation 2 to be 10.10.11.1/24 on the Cisco 7500.
Configure ISL and 802.1Q trunks over a two-port FEC between a Catalyst 6500 switch and the Cisco 7500 router.
Configure two port-channel subinterfaces with IP addresses for InterVLAN routing.

!--- Set the port speed to 100 and duplex to full. One of the requirements for EtherChannel !--- to work is for speed and duplex to be the same on both sides. To guarantee this, hard !--- code both speed and duplex on ports 3/1 and 3/2.

Catalyst6500> (enable) set port speed 3/1-2 100

Ports 3/1-2 transmission speed set to 100Mbps.

Catalyst6500> (enable) set port duplex 3/1-2 full

Ports 3/1-2 set to full-duplex.

!--- Enable FEC on ports 3/1 and 3/2. Because routers do not understand Port Aggregation !--- Protocol (PAgP), set the channel mode to one which causes ports to channel but which !--- does not generate PAgP frames.

Catalyst6500> (enable) set port channel 3/1-2 on

Port(s) 3/1-2 are assigned to admin group 105.
Port(s) 3/1-2 channel mode set to on.

!--- Enable trunking on ports 3/1 and 3/2. Because routers do not understand Dynamic !--- Trunking Protocol (DTP), set the trunking mode to nonegotiate, which causes ports to !--- trunk but which does not generate DTP frames. !--- Note: Because EtherChannel is configured first, any trunk settings that are applied !--- now to one port automatically apply to all other ports in the channel. !--- Enter the trunking encapsulation as either ISL…

Catalyst6500> (enable) set trunk 3/1 nonegotiate isl

Port(s) 3/1-2 trunk mode set to nonegotiate.
Port(s) 3/1-2 trunk type set to isl.

!--- …or as dot1q. !--- Ensure that the native VLAN (default is VLAN 1) matches across the link. For more !--- information about the native VLAN and 802.1Q trunking, refer to Trunking Between !--- Catalyst 4500/4000, 5500/5000, and 6500/6000 Series Switches Using 802.1Q !--- Encapsulation with Cisco CatOS System Software.

Cisco 7500 802.1Q Configuration for Cisco IOS Software Releases Earlier than 12.1(3)T
In Cisco IOS versions earlier than 12.1(3)T, the encapsulation dot1Q 1 native command under the subinterface was not available. However, it is still necessary to match the native VLAN across the link as described previously. To configure 802.1Q trunking in software versions earlier than 12.1(3)T, configure the IP address for VLAN 1 on the main port-channel 1 interface, not a port-channel subinterface.

Cisco 7500 Router show Commands
show interface port-channel channel number —Gives the member status for physical interfaces. In this example, a 2-port FEC is configured between ports 3/1 and 3/2 on the Catalyst 6000 and between interface FastEthernet 5/1/0 and 5/1/1 on the 7500. Port-channel 1 shows as up/up.
It has an IP address configured, which in this case means that it is the native VLAN IP address for 802.1Q trunking. See the Cisco 7500 802.1Q Configuration for Cisco IOS Software Releases Earlier than 12.1(3)T section of this document for more information. Output is also shown for the VLAN 2 802.1Q subinterface, from the show interface port channel 1.2 command.
