Introduction
This document describes how the Cisco IOSÂ® Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) operations of auto-enrollment and auto-rollover work and how the respective PKI timers are calculated for these operations.
Certificates have fixed lifetimes and expire at some point. If the certificates are used for authentication purposes for a VPN solution (for example), the expiry of these certificates leads to possible authentication failures that result in loss of VPN connectivity between the endpoints. In order to avoid this issue, these two mechanisms are available for automatic certificate renewal:
Auto-Enrollment for the client/spoke routers
Auto-Rollover for the Certification Authority (CA) server router
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:
PKI and the concept of trust
Basic configuration of CA on routers
Components Used
This document is not restricted to specific software and hardware versions.
The information in this document was created from devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Terminology
auto-enrollment
When a certificate on an end device is about to expire, auto-enrollment obtains a new certificate without disruption. When auto-enrollment is configured, the client/spoke router can request a new certificate at some time before its own certificate (known as its identity or ID certificate) expires.
auto-rollover
This parameter decides when the Certificate Server (CS) generates its rollover (shadow) certificate; if the command is entered under the CS configuration without any argument, the default time is 30 days.
Note: For the examples in this document, the value of this parameter is 10 minutes.
When a certificate on the CA server is about to expire, auto-rollover enables the CA to obtain a new certificate without disruption. When auto-rollover is configured, the CA router can generate a new certificate at some time before its own certificate expires. The new certificate, which is called the shadow or rollover certificate, becomes active at the precise moment that the current CA certificate expires.
With the use of the two features that are mentioned in the Introduction section of this document, the PKI deployment becomes automated and allows the spoke or client device to get a shadow/rollover identity certificate and shadow/rollover CA certificate prior to the current CA certificate expiry. This way, it can transition without interruption to the new ID and CA certificates when its current ID and CA certificates expire.
lifetime ca-certificate
This parameter specifies the lifetime of the CA certificate. The value of this parameter can be specified in days/hours/minutes.
Note: For the examples in this document, the value of this parameter is 30 minutes.
lifetime certificate
This parameter specifies the lifetime of the identity certificate that is issued by the CA router. The value of this parameter can be specified in days/hours/minutes.
Note: For the examples in this document, the value of this parameter is 20 minutes
Configure
Note: Smaller PKI timer values for lifetime, auto-rollover, and auto-enroll are used in this document in order to illustrate key auto-enroll and auto-rollover concepts. In a live network environment, Cisco recommends that you use the default lifetimes for these parameters. 
Tip: All of the PKI timer-based events, such as rollover and reenrollment, can be affected if there is no authoritative time source. For this reason, Cisco recommends that you configure Network Time Protocol (NTP) on all of the routers that peform PKI.
Cisco IOS CA Server Configuration
This section provides an example configuratinon for the Cisco IOS CA server.
RootCA#show ip interface brief
Interface               IP-Address     OK? Method Status         Protocol
Ethernet0/0             10.1.1.1       YES manual up             up

 lifetime ca-certificate 0 0 30
 cdp-url http://10.1.1.1/cgi-bin/pkiclient.exe?operation=GetCRL
 auto-rollover 0 0 10
 database url flash: 
Note: The value that is specified with the auto-rollover command is the number of days/hours/minutes before the end date of the current CA certificatethat the rollover certificate is generated. Therefore, if a CA certificate is valid from 12:00 to 12:30, then auto-rollover 0 0 10 implies that the rollover CA certificate is generated around 12:20.
Enter the show crypto pki certificate command in order to verify the configuration on the Cisco IOS CA server:
RootCA#show crypto pki certificate
CA Certificate

    end   date: 09:46:05 IST Nov 25 2012
  Associated Trustpoints: ios-ca 
Based on this output, the router includes a CA certificate that is valid from 9:16 to 9:46 IST Nov 25, 2012. Since auto-rollover is configured for 10 minutes, the shadow/rollover certificate is expected to be generated by 9.36 IST Nov 25, 2012.
In order to confirm, enter the show crypto pki timer command:
RootCA#show crypto pki timer
Load for five secs: 0%/0%; one minute: 0%; five minutes: 0%
Time source is NTP, 09:19:22.283 IST Sun Nov 25 2012

  |       26:43.558  CS CRL UPDATE
Based on this output, the show crypto pki timer command was issued at 9.19 IST, and the shadow/rollover certificate is expected to be generated within 16.43 minutes:
[09:19:22 + 00:16:43] = 09:36:05, which is the [end-date_of_current_CA_cert - auto_rollover_timer]; that is, [09:46:05 - 00:10:00] = 09:36:05.
   Client/Spoke Router Configuration
This section provides an example configuration for the client/spoke router.
Client-1#show ip interface brief
Interface            IP-Address      OK? Method Status      Protocol
Ethernet0/0          172.16.1.1      YES manual up          up 
crypto pki trustpoint client1
 enrollment url http://10.1.1.1:80
 subject-name CN=Client-1,OU=TAC,c=IN
 revocation-check crl
 auto-enroll 70 regenerate
Note: The auto-enroll command enables the auto-enrollment feature on the router. The command syntax is: auto-enroll [val%] [regenerate]. 
In the previous output, the auto-enroll feature is specified as 70%; that is, at 70% of the [lifetime of current_ID_cert], the router automatically reenrolls with the CA. 
Tip: Cisco recommends that you set the auto-enroll value to 60% or more in order to ensure that the PKI timers work properly.
The regenerate option leads to the creation of a new Rivest-Shamir-Addleman (RSA) key for certificate reenrollment/renewal purposes. If this option is not specified, the current RSA key is used.
Auto-Enrollment In Action
Complete these steps in order to verify the auto-enrollment feature:
Enter the crypto pki authenticate command in order to manually authenticate the trustpoint on the client router:

Client-1(config)#crypto pki authenticate client1 

Note: For more information on this command, refer to the Cisco IOS Security Command Reference.

Once you enter the command, an output similar to this should appear:

Certificate has the following attributes:
      Fingerprint MD5: 006B2E44 37FBC3F1 AA14F32B CDC4462E
      Fingerprint SHA1: 2999CC53 8BF65247 C0D704E9 FDC73002 A33910D4

% Do you accept this certificate? [yes/no]:
Type yes in order to accept the CA certificate on the client router. Then, a RENEW timer begins on the router:

Client-1#show crypto pki timer
PKI Timers
  |           0.086
  |           0.086  RENEW cvo-pki
  |        9:51.366  SESSION CLEANUP
Once the RENEW timer reaches zero, the client router automatically enrolls itself with the CA in order to obtain its identity certificate. Once the certificate is received, enter the show crypto pki certificate command in order to view it:

Client-1#show crypto pki certificate

The renew date is 09:30:08 and is calculated as shown here:

start-time + (%renewal of ID_cert_lifetime)

Or

09:16:57 + (70% * 20 minutes) = 09:30:08

The PKI timers reflect the same:

Client-1#show crypto pki timer

Once the RENEW timer expires, the router reenrolls with the CA in order to obtain a new ID certificate. After a certificate renewal has occurred, enter the show crypto pki cert command in order to view the new ID certificate:

Client-1#show crypto pki cert

    end   date: 09:46:05 IST Nov 25 2012
  Associated Trustpoints: client1

Notice that there is no longer a renew date; instead, a SHADOW timer begins:

Client-1#show crypto pki timer
Load for five secs: 0%/0%; one minute: 0%; five minutes: 0%
Time source is NTP, 09:34:57.922IST Sun Nov 25 2012
PKI Timers
  |          25.582  
  |          25.582  SESSION CLEANUP 
  |        6:20.618  SHADOW client1
Here is the process logic:

If the end-date of the ID certificate is not equal to the end-date of the CA certificate, then calculate a renew-date based on the auto-enroll percentage and start the RENEW timer.

If the end-date of the ID certificate is equal to the end-date of the CA certificate, then no renewal process is necessary since the current ID certificate is valid only as long as the current CA certificate is valid. Instead, a SHADOW timer is started.
This timer is also calculated based on the percentage mentioned in the auto-enroll command. For example, consider the validity dates of the renewed ID certificate that are shown in the previous example:
Validity Date of current ID cert: 
start date: 09:30:09 IST Nov 25 2012
end   date: 09:46:05 IST Nov 25 2012
The lifetime of this certificate is 16 minutes. Therefore, the rollover timer (that is, the SHADOW timer) is 70% of 16 minutes, which equals approximately 11 minutes. This calculation implies that the router begins requests for its shadow/rollover certificates at [09:30:09 + 00:11:00] = 09:41:09, which corresponds to the PKI SHADOW timer shown previously in this document:
Client-1#show crypto pki timer
Load for five secs: 0%/0%; one minute: 0%; five minutes: 0%
Time source is NTP, 09:34:57.922 IST Sun Nov 25 2012

Auto-Rollover In Action
This section describes the auto-rollover feature in action.

When the SHADOW timer expires, the rollover certificate appears on the CA router:

At the Client Router
As described previously in this document, the auto-enrollment feature began a SHADOW timer on the client router. When the SHADOW timer expires, the auto-enrollment feature enables the router to request the CA server for the rollover/shadow CA certificate. Once received, it queries for its rollover/shadow ID certificate as well. As a result, the router has two pairs of certificates: one pair that is current and the other pair that contains the rollover/shadow certificates:
Client-1#show crypto pki certificate

Notice the validity of the rollover ID certificate:
Validity Date: 
start date: 09:46:05 IST Nov 25 2012
end   date: 09:50:09 IST Nov 25 2012
The certificate lifetime is just four minutes (instead of the expected 20 minutes, as configured on the Cisco IOS CA server). Per the Cisco IOS CA server, the absolute ID certificate lifetime should be 20 minutes (which means, for a given client router, the sum of the lifetimes of the ID certificates (current + shadow) issued to it must not be greater than 20 minutes).
This process is further described here:
Here is the validity of the current ID certificate on the router:

start date: 09:30:09 IST Nov 25 2012
end   date: 09:46:05 IST Nov 25 2012

Therefore, the current_id_cert_lifetime is 16 minutes.
Here is the validity of the rollover ID certificate:

start date: 09:46:05 IST Nov 25 2012
end   date: 09:50:09 IST Nov 25 2012

Therefore, the rollover_id_cert_lifetime is four minutes.
Per the Cisco IOS, when the [current_id_cert_lifetime] is added to the [rollover_id_cert_lifetime], it must equal the [total_id_cert_lifetime]. This is true in this instance.
Sample PKI Timeline with Rollover and Enrollment
Important Considerations
The PKI timers require an authoritative clock in order to function properly. Cisco recommends that you use NTP in order to synchronize clocks between the client routers and the Cisco IOS CA router. In the absence of NTP, the system/hardware clock on the router can be used. For information on how to configure the hardware clock and make it authoritative, refer to the Basic System Management Configuration Guide, Cisco IOS Release 12.4T.

Upon the reload of a router, the synchronization of the NTP often takes a few minutes. However, the PKI timers are established almost immediately. As of Versions 15.2(3.8)T and 15.2(4)S, the PKI timers are automatically reevaluated after NTP is synchronized.

The PKI timers are not absolute; they are based on the remaining time and are, therefore, recalculated after a reboot. For example, assume the client router has an ID certificate that is valid for 100 days and the auto-enroll feature is set to 80%. Then, reenrollment is expected to occur after the 80th day. If the router is reloaded on the 60th day, it boots up and recalculates the PKI timer as shown here:
(remaining time) * (%auto-enroll) = (100-60) * 80% = 32 days.

Therefore, reenrollment occurs on the [60 + 32] = 92nd day.
When you configure the auto-enroll and auto-rollovertimers, it is important to configure them with values that allow SHADOW CA certificate availability on the PKI server when the PKI client requests one. This helps mitigate potential PKI services failures in a large-scale environment.
