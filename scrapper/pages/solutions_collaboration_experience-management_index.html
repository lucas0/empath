Awesome platform for tracking Customer service performance
What do you like best about the product?
Presentation of data is commendable, they are one of the experts. I have not seen a tool with such extensive analysis options. Their tool has multiple options to close loop for service recovery, adhoc grinding of data and various slicing and dicing options of the available data.
