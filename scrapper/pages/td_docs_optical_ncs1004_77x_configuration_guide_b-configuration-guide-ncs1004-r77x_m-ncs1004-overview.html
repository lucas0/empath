Cisco NCS 1004 Features
Cisco NCS 1004 is a two RU unit that supports up to 4.8 Tbps traffic. The NCS 1004 has two redundant, field replaceable AC and DC power supply units and three redundant, field replaceable fans. It also provides a field replaceable controller card. The NCS 1004 has SSD disks both on board the chassis and on the controller card for resiliency. Each NCS 1004 chassis provides four line cardslots. Each NCS 1004 slot can host a line card. See Supported Line Cards for more information.
The NCS 1004 delivers the following benefits:
Transport of any trunk rate from 150 200 to 600 Gbps wavelengths in 50 Gbps increments on the same platform through software provisioning.
Support of granular control of baud-rate and modulation format to maximize spectral efficiency.
One universal transponder that is optimized for performance for metro, long-haul, and submarine applications.
Support for up to 350,000 ps/nm of residual chromatic dispersion compensation.
Transport of 100GE and OTU4 client rates on the same platform through software provisioning.
600G DWDM, which provides unparalleled scale and density. 64 channels of 600G at 75 GHz providing 38.4 Tbps in 16 RU.
State-of-the-art AES-256 encryption at scale â€“ 4.8 Tbps of encrypted trunk capacity per 2 RU.
Interoperability with Cisco NCS 1001
When the Cisco NCS 1001 with Protection Switching Module (PSM) configured as non-revertive, interoperates with Cisco NCS 1004, traffic loss may occur. After the traffic has switched from the working to the protect path, do not perform a manual switch for 120 seconds. If you perform a manual switch, and the protect path fails, traffic loss of up to 13 seconds can occur.

Note
PSM switching with x50G is not supported as the switching time is more than 50 ms.

1.2T Card Interoperability with OTN-XP Card
The OTN-XP card can be interoperable with the 1.2T card. In an interoperability scenario, the 1.2T card can serve as a trunk port and the OTN-XP card can serve as a client port. The trunk port of OTN-XP can converge 10 x 10 G traffic and transmit as 100G traffic in the OTU4 mode. This OTU4 traffic can further be multiplexed to a higher bandwidth DWDM signal by connecting to 1.2T OTU4 client interface.
Trunk-side supported pluggables for the OTN-XP card
For interoperabliltiy with the 1.2T card, the supported pluggables are inserted in the OTN-XP card.
The OTN-XP card supports the Cisco QSFP-100G-LR4 Pluggable Optics Module (ONS-QSFP28-LR4) on the trunk side. Ensure that you use the same pluggable on the client side of the 1.2T card.
Client-side supported pluggables for the OTN-XP card
The OTN-XP card supports the following pluggables from its client side connection:
ONS-QSFP-4x10-MLR
QSFP-40G-SR4
Prerequisites for Interoperability with OTN-XP Card
Scenario on Interoperability with OTN-XP Card
Configure Interoperability between 1.2T Card with OTN-XP Card
Prerequisites for Interoperability with OTN-XP Card
Configure the OTN-XP card in the 10x10G traffic mode.
Configure the 1.2T card in the OTU4 client mode with supported trunk rate.
Ensure that the software installed on both route processors and cards are stable in the supported traffic modes for the 1.2T and OTN-XP card.
Scenario on Interoperability with OTN-XP Card
Consider a topology, where the OTN-XP card is configured in the 10x10G traffic mode and 1.2T card is configured in the OUT4 client mode with supported trunk rate.
For the solution to work, the OTN-XP trunk optics performs seamless interoperability with 1.2T client optics.
Configure Interoperability between 1.2T Card with OTN-XP Card
To configure interoperability, perform the following steps:
Configure the muxponder mode on the 1.2T card, see Configuring the Card Mode.
Configure the LC mode on the OTN-XP card, see Configuring the LC Mode.
Configure the OTN-XP card in the muxponder mode, see Configuring the Muxponder Mode for 10G Grey Muxponder.
Perform no shut on both trunk ports, use the following commands:
controller Optics R/S/I/P
no shut
The following is a sample to perform no shut on the trunk port:
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#configure
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios(config)#controller Optics 0/1/0/0
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios(config-Optics)#no shut
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios(config-Optics)#description trunk port
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios(config-Optics)#exit
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios(config)#exit

Note
Ensure that there are no alarms generated and link recovery after events such as fiber cut, card reload, pluggable Online Insertion and Removal (OIR), and re-provisions.
You can perform the following controller specific configurations on the OTN-XP card grey optics and 1.2T OTU4 client optics:
