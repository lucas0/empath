HTTP CONNECT
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.9.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1
This feature introduces support for handling the HTTP CONNECT method in AppQoE. With this support, services such as SSL Proxy and DRE optimize HTTP CONNECT encrypted traffic.

Information About HTTP CONNECT
HTTP CONNECT method enables the source server to start two-way communications with the destination server using an explicit proxy server. Using the HTTP CONNECT you can create a HTTP proxy tunnel over a TCP connection between the source and destination servers. The HTTP CONNECT traffic handling enables SSL Proxy and DRE to optimize the encrypted data in the HTTP Tunnel.
For more information on SSL/TLS Proxy see, Information about SSL/TLS Proxy.
Prerequisites for HTTP CONNECT
Ensure that the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices are running the Cisco IOS XE Release 17.9.1a.
An explicit proxy hosted on a remote server is required to broadcast a HTTP CONNECT request.
Restrictions For HTTP CONNECT
A HTTP CONNECT request is intended to be sent only to a proxy server.
A HTTP CONNECT request can be sent only using the following standard ports Port 80, 8080, and 8088.
HTTP CONNECT is not supported by United Threat Defense (UTD). Hence the configuration is blocked if UTD is enabled.
Use Cases Of HTTP CONNECT
SSL Proxy Traffic without HTTP CONNECT
In Cisco IOS XE Release 17.x releases, without the decryption of data, DRE fails to observe repeating patterns in a flow and the DRE compression is not effective. And hence, bypassing the DRE for the flow is mandatory or the data flowing to the DRE should be in clear text. When a HTTP CONNECT request is placed, the SSL Proxy doesn't decrypt the HTTP CONNECT SSL traffic, which results in the encrypted traffic flowing to the DRE, that fails to optimize the traffic.
SSL Proxy Traffic with HTTP CONNECT
Starting from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.9.1a, HTTP CONNECT handling in AppQoE enables the SSL Proxy to decrypt and send clear text data to the DRE for further optimizing.
Configure HTTP CONNECT Using a CLI Add-On Template
Before You Begin
Create a new CLI add-on template or edit an existing CLI add-on template.
For more information on CLI add-on feature templates, see CLI Add-On Feature Templates.
Configure HTTP CONNECT Using CLI
Enter configuration mode.
config-transaction
Enable HTTP CONNECT
sdwan appqoe http-connect enable server-port <port-number>

Note
You can only enter the following standard server port numbers to enable HTTP CONNECT: 80, 8080, and 8088.
If you don't enter a standard port number, the default server-port number is assumed as 80.
Commit the changes
commit
For example,
sdwan appqoe http-connect enable server-port80
Attach the CLI add-on template to the respective device.
Verify HTTP CONNECT Configuration
The following is a sample output from the show sslproxy statistics command:

In this output, Tunnel Proxied Connections and Tunneled Non-proxied Connections indicate that HTTP CONNECT request is successful.
Monitor HTTP CONNECT Using the CLI
Use the show sdwan appqoe flow flow-id command to monitor HTTP CONNECT on a device. The following is an example output:
Device# show sdwan appqoe flow flow-id 4278327056727738
Flow ID: 4278327056727738
