  Quick Facts
This task note describes how to configure the periodic Reboot DMP Task to run the DMP command.
■To avoid unexpected behavior and maintain normal operation of your devices, we highly recommended that you perform a soft reboot of all of the DMPs in your system regularly.
■The Reboot DMP Task applies globally to all DMPs. When the recommended reboot interval is different by DMP model, be sure to set the reboot task to meet the shortest time interval.
For example, in releases prior to Release 4.0, a weekly reboot is recommended for all media players. However, in Release 4.1.0-419, we recommend rebooting the SV-4K and the DMP-2K every 5 days. Therefore, if using the reboot task in a venue that uses DMP-2Ks, the reboot period should be configured for 120 hours.
For information about recommended media player maintenance for your release, see the Release Notes documentation.
■There are a few methods that you can use to reboot DMPs:
Note : Before you perform a reboot, verify there are no active scripts running.
–Reboot DMPs manually from Cisco Vision Director doing the following:
Click Configuration > System Configuration > System Tasks > Reboot DMP Task
–Enable a system task to run periodically to reboot DMPs after they have been running for a specified number of hours (default is 336). The default start time is 03:00 a.m.

■ Dashboard command to use: RebootDevice —Reboots the DMP using the DMP management software. This is the default.
■ Reboot devices where up time more than (in hours) —specifies the number of hours that DMPs can run continuously before a reboot occurs.
Set this to the number of runtime hours that corresponds to the minimum recommended reboot period for all of the types of DMPs at your site and that avoids any timing that will conflict with event times. Default is 336 hours (14 days).
Note : Verify there are no active scripts running during a DMP reboot.
7. Click the Refresh icon to accept the changes to the Property Values.
8. (Optional) To change the default start time (03:00) of a scheduled reboot when the DMP Reboot Task is enabled:
