Cisco has been working with individual customers on an issue related to memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010. These components are widely used across the industry, and have been included in some Cisco products.
Although the majority of Cisco products using these components are experiencing field failure rates below expected levels, the components are known to slowly degrade over time. A handful of our customers have recently experienced a higher number of failures, leading us to change our approach to managing this issue.
Cisco has decided to take a charge of $655 million related to the expected cost of managing these issues, including supporting our fix-on-fail and technology migration programs. We are taking this action to support our customers and partners.
