  1  Introduction
1.1  Document Purpose
This document seeks to outline the background and usage of the eStreamer eNcore client in order to assist users with installation and execution.
1.2  Background
The Cisco Event Streamer (i.e. eStreamer) allows users to stream system intrusion, discovery, and connection data from Firepower Management Center or managed device (i.e., the eStreamer server) to external client applications. eStreamer responds to client requests with terse, compact, binary encoded messages that facilitate high performance.
Historically, the eStreamer SDK has been wrapped with some additional code to create separate Perl applications (e.g., the Cisco eStreamer for Splunk app and the CEF agent).
eStreamer eNcore is a multi-platform, multi-process Python application that is compatible with FMC versions 6.0 and above.
1.3  Application Summary
eNcore is an all-purpose client, which requests all possible events from eStreamer, parses the binary content, and outputs events in various formats to support other SIEMs. eNcore was built from scratch in Python with a scalable and fast multi-process architecture. It supports version 6.0 of Firepower Management Center. It was built and tested on CentOS 7, but should work with any Linux distribution that supports the pre-requisites. The software will run on Windows, although, it has not been made production-ready yet.
There are three packages associated with eStreamer eNcore.
1.3.1  eStreamer-eNcore CLI for Sentinel
This is a command line interface for eStreamer eNcore. It runs standalone to request data from the FMC eStreamer server and output its data. The output data format can be:
—      key-value pairs designed to maintain compatibility with previous Splunk collectors
—      JSON
—      CEF which maintains backwards compatibility with the previous cef-agent.
The output can be streamed to files, a TCP or UDP network port, stdout.
  2  eNcore CLI Prerequisites
The CLI version of eNcore can be run on either Python 2.7 or Python 3.6+. You must also have a means of splitting the FMC’s PKCS12 file. The default approach is to install pyOpenSSL and let eNcore do the work for you.
Note: The encore.sh script should guide you through all these points if you wish to get going immediately, but it is worth being familiar with these points prior to install.
  To check whether Python2.7 is present, use following command:
which python
  To test where Python2.7 is present, use the following command.
whereis python
  Note: If you are installing the CLI version on a device running Splunk, then it is worth noting that Splunk has its own version of Python. The Splunk Python has been compiled differently from the normal distribution – specifically, it is built with PyUnicodeUCS2. The encore.sh script will detect this and warn you. If you encounter this problem, then you will need to create a new user and run eStreamer-eNcore as that user. You should consider running the Splunk add on instead.
To check for pyOpenSSL, use the following command:
pip list | grep -i pyOpenSSL

Alternatively using the python3 version will no longer require the pyUnicodeUS4 complication.  To access the python3 branch perform the following

git checkout python3


  2.1  Python 2.7 Installation
Use the following command to install Python on CentOS:
sudo yum install python
  2.2  pyOpenSSL
Install pyOpenSSL as follows:
sudo yum install python-pip python-devel openssl-devel gcc
sudo pip install pyOpenSSL

If using python3 branch then run the following

sudo pip3 install pyOpenSSL
2.3  EPEL Repo Dependency for RHEL
If you are having problems installing these packages, then you may need to enable the EPEL repository. Instructions for installing and enabling the EPEL repository are available on the World Wide Web.
2.4  Running eNcore CLI on Azure
Create a new Linux resource such as Ubuntu 18.04 LTS:
  Assign CPU(s) to the Virtual Instance. eNcore CLI can support up to 12 threads, we recommend 8-16 cores compute optimized, eNcore CLI can support up to 7k events/second using 16 CPU F16s_v2 option.  Scale according to expected volume of your organization, the minimum recommended number of CPUs is 4 for low volume (>500 ev/sec) operations.
  Name your instance and download the pem certificates
Make note of the Public IP assigned to your instance, you will use this to create a certificate in the FMC eStreamer
Connect to the Command Line version of your instance using the pem file. Now you are ready to proceed with the installation.  Azure also has a shortcut to enable a quick command line connection.


ssh -I <private key path> azureuser@<public ip>
2.5  Running eNcore CLI on Windows
Warning:       Windows is not yet supported for production execution. If, however, you wish to attempt an install for the CLI version, then you will need to run the following commands.
pip install pyOpenSSL
pip install win-inet-pton
    3  Installing eStreamer eNcore CLI
3.1  Build the eNcore Client from Source
Use the following command to copy the file from your local machine to the target device:
git clone https://github.com/CiscoSecurity/fp-05-microsoft-sentinel-connector.git

The project can also be downloaded to zip or

3.3  Create (or copy existing) PKCS12 file
See Appendix A for instructions on how to create a PKCS12 file in the FMC and download it.
3.4  Install the PKCS12 File
Use the following command to securely copy the pkcs12 file to the eNcore CLI installation.
scp -i /path/to/pem/encore-demo-2_key.pem /local/path/<public ip>.pkcs12 azureuser@<Public     Ip>:/tmp/

Copy the certificate from /tmp to the runtime path of the git project
   
cp /tmp/client.pkcs12 ~/fp-05-microsoft-sentinel-connector
3.6.8  Test
Change the working directory to /using the following command:
cd ~/fp-05-microsoft-sentinel-connector

Then, run the encore shell script – you will be guided through any additional configuration:
./encore.sh test
  The script will verify that you have the pre-requisites installed, notably:
—      Python 2.7, Python 3.6+ requires “python3” branch from git
—      the correct build of Python
—      pyOpenSSL
—      a client.pkcs12 file
—      a valid host
—      It will prompt you to choose whether to output data for Splunk, CEF or JSON, in this guide we use the CEF outputter, however future versions may use JSON or other custom formats on depending on the Sentinel Connector being used
  If there are any missing items, you will be presented with an explanation. An example explanation is in the following figure.
  Figure 1. Choosing your output
  Figure 2: Missing pkcs12 File
    You will then be prompted to enter the IP / FQDN of the FMC and the PKCS12 file password.
  Figure 3: Enter Password
    Figure 4: Successful Test
4. Running eNcore CLI
If you run encore.sh without any parameters, you will be presented with brief instructions.
  Figure 5: Help Screen
    For your first run, run it in the foreground so you can see what is happening. Every two minutes, the screen will update with a note of how many records have been processed. If you wish to change the update frequency, see the monitor.period configuration setting.
  Figure 6: Running in the Foreground with Monitor Status
    Note: To stop the foreground process, press ctrl-c.
5.  Configuration Options
5.1  Essential Configuration
The default configuration file is set up to run out of the box. Following is a brief explanation of each setting in case you wish to customize.
5.1.1  Subscription Server
This is the FMC host and associated information. If you encounter TLS difficulties and are willing to downgrade, then you can change tlsVersion to 1.0.
        Note: Note that downgrading the TLS version is useful for debugging and seeing the software work but it is not a recommended long-term strategy. It is recommended instead to fix the root cause.
  Figure 8: Subscription Server Screen
    "subscription": {
        "servers": [
            {
                "host": "1.2.3.4",
                "port": 8302,
                "pkcs12Filepath": "client.pkcs12",
                "@comment": "Valid values are 1.0 and 1.2",
                "tlsVersion": 1.2
            }
        ], …
5.1.2  Monitor
The monitor is a separate thread that runs monitoring and maintenance tasks. By default, it runs every two minutes. It will report the number of events received and handled and will check the status of sub-processes. If there have been any problems, the monitor will place the client into an error state and the client will shut itself down.
  Figure 9: Monitor Screen
    "monitor": {
        "period": 120,
        "velocity": false,
        "bookmark": false,
        "subscribed": true,
        "handled": true
    },
5.1.3  Start
The eStreamer server expects requests to state their chosen start time. There are broadly three options:
•     0: Return all data from the earliest point available on the FMC
•     1: Return all data from now onwards
•     2: Use a bookmark to pick up where we left off. First run is from 0
  Figure 10: Start Screen
    "@startComment": "0 for genesis, 1 for now, 2 for bookmark",
    "start": 2,
5.14  Outputters (Output Data Location)
Two examples of outputters are given in the figure below. Although only one outputter is required – one that sends CEF events to the Sentinel connector, it is often useful to write CEF output to local files. The second outputter shown in the figure below writes the CEF events to local files.
Figure 11: Outputters Screen
        "outputters": [
            {
                "name": "CEF",
                "adapter": "cef",
                "enabled": true,
                "stream": {
                    "uri": "udp://10.0.1.2:514",
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "CEFfile",
                "adapter": "cef",
                "enabled": true,
                "stream": {
                    "uri": "relfile:///data/data.{0}.cef",
                    "options": {
                        "rotate": false,
                        "maxLogs": 9999
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
5.2  Advanced Configuration Options
Key
Definition
alwaysAttemptToContinue
true | false.  Controls whether eNcore client will persist a connection even if the CLI process has been terminated
Enabled
true | false. Controls whether eNcore will run.
connectTimeout
The duration in seconds the client will wait for a connection to establish before failing.
responseTimeout
The duration in seconds the client will wait for a response before timing out.
monitor.period
The period in seconds between each execution of monitor tasks. Default is 120. Lower numbers are useful for debugging but will create more log traffic.
monitor.velocity
true | false. True will display the speed at which the client is processing records. A positive value means the client is processing events faster than eStreamer is sending them. Negative is slower. Once up to date, this should hover around zero.
monitor.bookmark
true | false. True will show the last bookmark timestamp. This is useful to see how far behind the eNcore client is.
monitor.subscribed
true | false. True will report the total number of events subscribed.
monitor.handled
true | false. True will report the total number of events written to output.
Start
0 specifies oldest data available
1 specifies data as of now
2 specifies use of bookmark
logging.level
Levels include FATAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, VERBOSE, and TRACE. Select the level of logging as per your requirement. It is strongly recommended that you do not use anything above INFO for production environments. DEBUG will generate very large log files and TRACE will significantly affect performance.
logging.format
This describes the format of the log and how they are stored. Default configuration setting for message format is “{date-time}-{name of module}-{level of logging-message}”.
logging.stdOut
true | false. This determines whether log output is also shown in Standard Output.
logging.filepath
This specifies the location of the application log.
maxQueueSize
Maximum number of messages buffered before throttling takes place. It is essentially a buffer size. The larger this number, the longer it will take to shutdown. Default configuration setting is 100. Do not change.
subscription.servers[]
While this is an array, eNcore can only currently support one server. The array is to support the future ability to connect to multiple hosts.
server.host
The IP address of the FMC (eStreamer Server). Default configuration is 1.2.3.4. If you change the host entry after having run eNcore then new cache, bookmark and metadata files will be generated.
server.port
The server port to connect to. Default 8302.
server.pkcs12Filepath
The PKCS12 filepath location. If you change this having already run eNcore, then you must also delete the cached public and private key otherwise eNcore will continue to use those. They are called {host}-{port}_pkcs.cert and {host}-{port}_pkcs.key.
server.tlsVersion
Valid options are 1.0 and 1.2.
subscription.records
Do not change these values.
handler.records.metadata
true | false. If you wish to exclude the output of metadata (since it has no timestamp information) then set this to false.
handler.records.flows
true | false. If you wish to exclude connection flow records then set this to false.
handler.outputters[]
An array of outputter controllers which define the behavior and format of what gets written by eNcore.
outputter.name
This is a human readable name for your conveience. It is unused by the code.
outputter.adapter
Data is read from eStreamer and stored in a structured internal format. The adapter transforms the data to a desired format. Recognized values are:
—      splunk
—      json
outputter.enabled
true | false. You can have more than one outputter specified at once. If you wish to disable a specific outputter, set this flag to false. If all outputters are false (or there are no outputters) then it behaves as a sink.
outputter.passthru
true | false. If true then data flowing through bypasses decoding and metadata processing. It is very fast but of limited use. Its primary purpose is for debugging.
outputter.stream.uri
Specify the location where the output will be stored. You can specify a file URI as normal (e.g., file:///absolute/path/to/file) or a relative filepath (relfile:////relative/path/to/file).
  Only file URLs are supported currently.
outputter.stream.options
File-based streams require additional options.
option.rotate
true | false. Set if you want log rotation. Default configuration setting for this is true. Please note that eNcore will not delete any old files. If you wish to do that, you will need to script it separately and schedule it.
Example:
Call this from a cron job.
#!/bin/bash
find /opt/splunk/etc/apps/eStreamer/log/* -mmin +1440 -exec rm {} \;
option.maxLogs
Specify the size of the log (number of lines). Default configuration for this is 10,000. You can have fewer, larger files (e.g, 50,000).
  5.3  Execution
Various shell scripts options are available.
During installation and initial setup – or perhaps for debugging purposes it is useful to run the following commands.
./encore.sh test
And
./encore.sh foreground
In all other cases, it is expected that encore will be run in the background, for which the following commands are pertinent.
./encore.sh start
./encore.sh stop
./encore.sh restart
Figure 12: Start, Tail Log, Stop
5.4  Logging
By default, eNcore will output an estreamer.log application log in its working directory with a log level of INFO. The format of the log file can be adjusted using the logging.format configuration setting. The level can also be adjusted. It is recommended that the default settings are left in place for production execution.
6  Sending data to Sentinel
6.1 Configuring Encore to Stream UDP

        Configure encore to stream CEF data using UDP on port 514

        If encore is already in process use the encore.sh stop/start command to restart encore
6.2 Creating a Sentinel Workspace
  Once you’ve established a working eNcore client between the FMC and your Azure instance you can route your data outputs to Sentinel using an agent collector

If you don’t have a Sentinel Workspace proceed with the following.

6.2  Setting up the CEF Data Connector
Once you’ve established a working eNcore client between the FMC and your Azure instance you can route your data outputs to Sentinel using an agent collector

Please refer the official Microsoft guide (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/connect-cef-agent?tabs=rsyslog) , accessing


Accessing the connector documentation guide directly from Sentinel is preferred as the docs and prepopulated commands will contain workspace and primary key information specific to your Azure instance.  The following steps below are directly from the Azure Sentinel setup guide for reference, again it is better to use direct documentation with the Sentinel platform since it contains the exact command and workspace/primary ids that will need to be run when installing the agent collector.

Run the deployment script
1.      From the Azure Sentinel navigation menu, click Data connectors. From the list of connectors, click the Common Event Format (CEF) tile, and then the Open connector page button on the lower right.
2.      Under 1.2 Install the CEF collector on the Linux machine, copy the link provided under Run the following script to install and apply the CEF collector, or from the text below:
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/DataConnectors/CEF/cef_installer.py&&sudo python cef_installer.py [WorkspaceID] [Workspace Primary Key]
3.      While the script is running, check to make sure you don't get any error or warning messages.
 Note
Using the same machine to forward both plain Syslog and CEF messages
If you plan to use this log forwarder machine to forward Syslog messages as well as CEF, then in order to avoid the duplication of events to the Syslog and CommonSecurityLog tables:
1.      On each source machine that sends logs to the forwarder in CEF format, you must edit the Syslog configuration file to remove the facilities that are being used to send CEF messages. This way, the facilities that are sent in CEF won't also be sent in Syslog. See Configure Syslog on Linux agent for detailed instructions on how to do this.
2.      You must run the following command on those machines to disable the synchronization of the agent with the Syslog configuration in Azure Sentinel. This ensures that the configuration change you made in the previous step does not get overwritten.
sudo su omsagent -c 'python /opt/microsoft/omsconfig/Scripts/OMS_MetaConfigHelper.py --disable'


https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/connect-cef-agent?tabs=rsyslog

After running the validation script you should be able to see data coming into the Azure Sentinel Analytics screen



Note:  Seeing the messing Received CEF message in agent (incoming port 25226) is an indicator that the validation and configuration of the agent was successful

7  Troubleshooting and questions
7.1  Error messages
As far as possible, eNcore has been engineered to provide meaningful error messages. Below is an example error message.
Figure 13: Example Error Message
The eStreamer service has closed the connection. There are a number of possible causes which may show above in the error log.
If you see no errors then this could be that
 * the server is shutting down
 * there has been a client authentication failure (please check that your outbound IP address matches that associated with your certificate - note that if your device is subject to NAT then the certificate IP must match the upstream NAT IP)
 * there is a problem with the server. If you are running FMC v6.0, you may need to install "Sourcefire 3D Defense Center S3 Hotfix AZ 6.1.0.3-1")
  If you encounter errors that do not make sense or require further explanation, please contact support so that we can fix the problem and improve the error messages.

Microsoft Sentinel Agent install:   If you encounter issues install the Microsoft agent on Azure then  try reinstalling the OMS

7.2  Frequently Asked Questions
Can I output my data to a different server?
Yes. Currently eNcore only writes to the filesystem, but you could mount an NFS or SMB share and specify its path as above. This may impact performance.
  Can I run more than one instance?
Yes, using the CLI version. Although currently the encore.sh shell script only supports one instance. The underlying Python program prefixes temporary files (e.g., metadata, certificates, bookmarks) with the host and port. You will also need to update the outputter locations (e.g., [Splunk] … directory = splunk) in order to avoid data collision. If you wish to run more than one instance we recommend you extract additional copies of eStreamer-eNcore and configure separately in order to avoid changing encore.sh.
  Can I connect to more than one FMC?
Currently not within a single instance. However, you can configure multiple instances as above.
  Can eNcore de-duplicate data to keep my SIEM costs lower?
Not today. It is on the roadmap.
  Can I run two instances of eNcore in a HA pair?
Yes and no. It is technically possible to run two side-by-side, but they will be completely ignorant of each other and output double the data. It may be preferable to run them in a hot-stand-by configuration where the primary client’s state and configuration data is regularly copied to the secondary client. The state and configuration data in question is estreamer.conf; x.x.x.x-port_bookmark.dat; x.x.x.x-port_cache.dat; x.x.x.x-port_pkcs.cert; x.x.x.x-port_pkcs.key; x.x.x.x-port_status.dat
  Can I increase the logging granularity?
Yes, change logging.level in the conf file. Please note that while it is possible to increase this level to VERBOSE, the performance impact will be crippling. DEBUG may be useful but slow. We strongly recommend not going above INFO for standard production execution.

9.1  FMC eStreamer Certificate Creation
Steps to generate an eStreamer client certificate are as follows:
Navigate to the web interface of the FMC – https://fmc-ip-address and log in with your FMC credentials.
In the FMC 6.x GUI, navigate to System > Integration > eStreamer

Figure 14: FMC eStreamer Certificate Creation
    Click Create Client. Provide the Hostname and password.
Note: This should be the IP of the client, which will be collecting the event data from the FMC. This password will be required when you first execute eStreamer eNcore.
Please note that the IP address you enter here must be the IP address of the eStreamer-eNcore client from the perspective of the FMC. In other words, if the client is behind a NAT device, then the IP address must be that of the upstream NAT interface.
  Figure 15: Create Client Hostname and Password Screen
    Click Save.
Figure 16: Create Client Save Screen
    Download the pkcs12 file.
  Figure 17: Download Screen
    Copy the pkcs12 file to the desired location in the target device. By default, eStreamer-eNcore will look for /path/eStreamer_eNcore/client.pkcs12. If you wish to use a different filename, then you must edit the estreamer.conf file.
