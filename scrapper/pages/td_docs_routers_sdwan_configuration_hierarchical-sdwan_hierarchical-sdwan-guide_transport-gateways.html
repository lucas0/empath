Description
Multi-Region Fabric: Transport Gateways
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.8.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.8.1
An edge router or border router that has connections to two networks that lack direct connectivity can function as a transport gateway. This is helpful for enabling connectivity between routers that are configured to be within the same access region, but which do not have direct connectivity.
Information About Transport Gateways
Minimum supported releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.8.1a, Cisco vManage Release 20.8.1
Various devices assigned to the same access region may operate in networks that lack direct connectivity—so-called disjoint networks. If there is an edge router or a border router that operates in the same access region, and has connections to the two disjoint networks, you can configure that router to function as a transport gateway. As a transport gateway, the router provides connectivity to the edge routers in the disjoint networks.

The Problem That Transport Gateways Address
Without transport gateway functionality, one method for enabling traffic between devices that lack direct connectivity is to create a control policy that routes traffic between the devices in disjoint networks using an intermediate device that has connectivity to both networks, and configuring specific routes.
There are problems with this approach:
Complexity: Configuring a control policy to advertise prefixes is complicated.
Potential traffic black hole: The control policy cannot detect whether a device or a configured route is unavailable. This can lead to packet loss if a route becomes unavailable.
Routing Mechanism
When a router is configured to function as a transport gateway, it does the following for each route between devices within its primary region.
Installs each route that it learns from the Cisco vSmart controllers for the access region.
Re-originates each route that it learns from the Cisco vSmart controllers, substituting its own TLOCs as the next hop for the routes. This means that it substitutes its TLOCs as the next hop for each route and advertises the route to the Cisco vSmart controllers for its region.
Note that this process does not re-originate primary region routes into the core region, or core region routes into an access region.
The effect of configuring a router as a transport gateway is that it can provide routes for all intra-region traffic. A device in the network uses the transport gateway route only if it lacks a direct route to the destination.
Primary Region Only
If you configure an edge router to act as a transport gateway, the edge router re-originates only routes in a primary access region. For information about primary and secondary regions, see Information About Secondary Regions.
If you configure a border router to act as a transport gateway, it re-originates only routes in the access region, not the core region.
Preference for a Transport Gateway Route
After configuring a transport gateway, there may be multiple paths available between two routers in an access region. When multiple paths are available between two routers, the overlay management protocol (OMP) applies best path selection logic to choose the best path. The best path selection logic is biased toward paths with the smallest number of hops, which may possibly exclude the transport gateway path. OMP best path selection logic includes the following:
By default, OMP selects a direct path if one is available.
If no direct path is available, OMP selects a path with more hops, such as through a transport gateway.
You can configure the OMP logic as follows:
Prefer a transport gateway path over a direct path.
Consider direct paths and transport gateway paths as equal.
See Configure the Transport Gateway Path Preference Using Cisco vManage.
Multiple Transport Gateways
If there are multiple transport gateways active in a region, then a device applies equal-cost multi-path routing (ECMP) across all of the available transport gateways.

Advantages of Using Transport Gateways
Enables easier configuration than the control policy method.
If a route becomes unavailable, the transport gateway withdraws the route to the edge router and stops re-originating the paths to it, preventing networking black holes.
Traffic Protocols
Transport gateway routers can handle IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.
Supported Devices for Transport Gateways
Minimum supported releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.8.1a, Cisco vManage Release 20.8.1
Transport gateway functionality: Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices only
Ability to use transport gateway paths: Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices and Cisco vEdge devices
Restrictions for Transport Gateways
Minimum supported releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.8.1a, Cisco vManage Release 20.8.1
Does not affect Cloud onRamp for SaaS routes.
Transport gateway functionality is not supported on routers that have a secondary region configured.

Note
Attempting to configure transport gateway functionality on such a router results in an error.
If you enable transport gateway functionality on multiple devices within the same region, providing more than one transport gateway path between edge routers in disjoint networks, the edge routers apply best path selection logic to determine the best path.
If there are multiple transport gateways and OMP selected transport gateway paths, then it applies ECMP to all available transport gateway paths.
By default, OMP selects a direct path if one is available, and if not, selects a path with more hops, such as through a transport gateway, if available. However, you can configure the OMP logic differently. See Information About Transport Gateways.
If you enable transport gateway functionality on multiple devices within the same region, the Cisco vSmart controller for the region ensures that a route that is re-originated by one transport gateway is not advertised to another transport gateway. By preventing the advertising of a transport gateway route to another transport gateway, the Cisco vSmart controller helps to prevent any potential routing loops.
Due to the resource demands of transport gateway functionality, we recommend enabling this only on a high-performance device with CPU and memory resources to handle the additional load. The specific resource requirements depend on your networking environment.
You cannot configure dynamic on-demand tunnels for a device configured as a transport gateway. This restriction applies in MRF- and non-MRF architectures. For information about dynamic on-demand tunnels, see Dynamic On-Demand Tunnels in the Cisco SD-WAN Systems and Interfaces Configuration Guide, Cisco IOS XE Release 17.x.
