CSCvy20701 2408 IOM upgrade/downgrade failure on subset shipped April 2021
Problem Description
Firmware upgrade or downgrade attempts on a subset of Cisco UCS-IOM-2408 Fabric Extender Expansion Modules shipped in April 2021 will fail and continuously repeat the firmware update process.
Background
A subset of UCS-IOM-2408 Fabric Extender Expansion Modules shipped in April 2021 will not allow a firmware upgrade or downgrade to complete successfully. This is a hardware issue.
Problem Symptom
Any upgrade or downgrade attempt of the 2408 I/O Module (IOM) firmware will fail and loop continuously. This will primarily manifest as a failure immediately after the initial installation to a Unified Computing System (UCS) domain.
If the IOM did not require upgrade or downgrade upon installation, the IOM will be functional until a firmware change is attempted. In this case, the Technical Assistance Center (TAC) will not be able to access the IOM’s debug kernel shell.
During Upgrade Failures
Cisco UCS Manager faults will show many occurences of a message similar to "IOM 1/1 (A) is auto upgrading firmware".
The NX-OS CLI command show fex detail will repeat "Requesting satellite to download image".
The IOM /cmc/log/updated log will show:
NOCSN_updated-3-CMC  0:validate_image_signature:Image signature validation failed#012
NOCSN_updated-3-CMC  1067:check_magic:error reading key
NOCSN_updated-3-CMC  1067:check_magic:error reading key
Workaround/Solution
The impacted UCS-IOM-2408 Fabric Extender Expansion Modules should be replaced. Follow the instructions in the How To Identify Affected Products section in order to determine if your IOM is impacted. If it is impacted, complete the form at the end of this field notice to request a replacement.
How To Identify Affected Products
If installation has not been attempted, the UCS-IOM-2408 serial numbers can be collected from the Cisco Sales Order details when they were procured.
If installed, the UCS-IOM-2408 expansion module serial numbers can be collected from UCS Manager or from the NX-OS CLI.
UCS Manager - Click the Equipment tab and choose Chassis > Chassis X > IO Module Y for any UCS-IOM-2408 expansion module in question. The serial number will be listed under Properties.
NX-OS CLI - SSH to the Cluster Virtual IP address and enter this sequence of commands in order to show all IOM serial numbers in the system:
connect nxos a
show fex
exit
connect nxos b
show fex
exit
With this list of serial numbers, verify if the UCS-IOM-2408 IOM is impacted or not using the Serial Number Validation Tool in the next section.
