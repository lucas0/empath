The Cisco® 5760 Wireless Controller (Figure 1) is an industry-leading platform designed for 802.11ac networks with maximum performance and services at scale, combined with high availability for mission-critical wireless networks. Through the Unified Access Data Plane (UADP) application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), it delivers wire-speed performance with services such as advanced quality of service (QoS), flexible NetFlow v9, and downloadable ACLs. Delivering on the One Network component of the Unified Access vision, the Cisco 5760 offers:
●   Wire-speed 60-Gbps throughput with services
●   Up to 1000 access points per controller and 72,000 access points in a cluster
●   Up to 12,000 clients per controller and 864,000 clients in a cluster
●   Network traffic visibility through flexible NetFlow v9
●   RF visibility and protection
●   Cisco CleanAir® technology
●   ClientLink 3.0
●   VideoStream
●   Access Point Stateful Switchover(AP SSO)
●   Application Visibility with AVC
●   Service Discovery Gateway

Features
The 5760 Wireless Controller can operate in both converged access mode and centralized mode. Converged access mode provides a hierarchical network design that distributes the wireless data plane at the access layer on Cisco Catalyst® switches for maximum performance and scale. Converged access mode provides maximum resiliency by constraining outages to smaller failure domains. Additionally, converged access mode delivers high availability with access point stateful failover (access point SSO), making sure SSIDs are highly available and have minimal effect on wireless clients. (See Tables 1 and 2)

Additive Capacity Upgrade Licenses
The simplified right-to-use (RTU) licensing model allows customers to buy only the required number of access point capacity licenses and then add the licenses through a simple CLI on the controller.

The additive capacity licenses allow for the increase in access point capacity supported by the controller up to a maximum of 1000 access points. As an example, if a controller was initially ordered with the 250 access point support, that capacity could be later increased to up to 1000 access points by purchasing a 750 access point additive capacity license (750 * “LIC-CT5760-1A” or “L-LIC-CT5760-1A”). The single access point adder license SKU for the 5700 Series Wireless Controller allows customers the flexibility to purchase the exact number of licenses at a time. (See Tables 6 and 7)

DTLS Cisco 5700 Series Wireless Controllers
Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) is required to encrypt the data plane traffic. If a customer chooses the software option “SW5760K9-xxxx” (for example, SW5760K9-32SE), DTLS data encryption is enabled by default. Customers planning to install this device physically in Russia must order the controller with DTLS disabled by choosing the DTLS disabled software version (for example, SW5760LPE-K9-32SE). Consult your local government regulations to make sure that data DTLS encryption is permitted.
