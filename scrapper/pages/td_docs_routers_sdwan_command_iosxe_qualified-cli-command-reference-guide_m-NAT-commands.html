Command Default
Loopback interface of the inside source address is not configured.

Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10.1a
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
You may remove all NAT mapping configuration before configuring port-preservation command to allow port-preservation to take effect (avoiding reboot).
If there are existing NAT mapping configurations, ensure that you reboot the device after configuring the ip nat settings preserve-sdwan-ports command to achieve the expected behavior. If not, add NAT mapping configurations after configuring the ip nat settings preserve-sdwan-ports command.
Use the ip nat settings preserve-sdwan-ports command to enable port preservation for the control traffic using SD-WAN known ports. This is enabled during the following conditions:
Interface overload
Loopback overload
The following example shows how to configure NAT port preservation capability:
Device(config)# ip nat settings preserve-sdwan-ports
ip nat translation (timeout)
To change the Network Address Translation (NAT) timeout, use the ip nat translation command in global configuration mode. To disable the timeout, use the no form of this command.
ip nat translation { dns-timeout | syn-timeout | icmp-timeout | max-entries | port-timeout tcp-timeout timeout udp-timeout }
no ip nat translation { dns-timeout | syn-timeout | icmp-timeout | max-entries | port-timeout tcp-timeout timeout udp-timeout }
Syntax Description
dns-timeout
Specifies that the timeout value applies to connections to the Domain Name System (DNS). The default is 60 seconds.
syn-timeout
Specifies that the timeout value applies to TCP flows immediately after a synchronous transmission (SYN) message that consists of digital signals that are sent with precise clocking. The default is 60 seconds.
icmp-timeout
Specifies the timeout value for Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) flows. The default is 60 seconds.
port-timeout
Specifies that the timeout value applies to the TCP/UDP port.
tcp-timeout
Specifies that the timeout value applies to the TCP port. Default is 86,400 seconds (24 hours).
timeout
Specifies that the timeout value applies to dynamic translations, except for overload translations. The default is 86,400 seconds (24 hours).
udp-timeout
Specifies that the timeout value applies to the UDP port. The default is 300 seconds (5 minutes).
Command Default
NAT translation timeouts are enabled by default.
Command Modes
Global configuration (config)
Command History
Release
Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r
Command qualified for use in Cisco vManage CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
When port translation is configured, each entry contains more information about the traffic that is using the translation, which gives you finer control over translation entry timeouts. Non-DNS UDP translations time out after 5 minutes, and DNS times out in 1 minute. TCP translations time out in 24 hours, unless a TCP Reset (RST) or a Finish (FIN) bit is seen on the stream, in which case they will time out in 1 minute.
For usage guidelines, see the Cisco IOS XE ip nat translation (timeout) command.
The following example shows how to configure the router to cause UDP port translation entries to time out after 10 minutes (600 seconds):
Device# configure terminal
Device(config)# ip nat translation udp-timeout 600

Release Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10.1a
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
A prefix that is configured on an interface is used as the stateless prefix on that interface. If no interface-specific prefix is configured, the configured global prefix is used for NAT64 translation.
For usage guidelines, see the Cisco IOS XE nat64 route command.
Example
The following example shows how to assign an IPv4 prefix and mask to an interface:
Device(config)# nat64 route 0.0.0.0/0 GigabitEthernet1

Release Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10.1a
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
By default, NAT64 adds a fragmentation header for all IPv4-to-IPv6 packets that do not have the Do Not Fragment (DF) bits set. Configure the nat64 settings fragmentation header disable command to disable the adding of a fragmentation header for packets that are not fragmented.
By default, NAT64 copies ToS bits from an IPv4 header to an IPv6 header. Configure the nat64 settings v4 tos ignore command to disable the copying of ToS bits from an IPv4 header to an IPv6 header.
Example
The following example shows how to disable the NAT64 fragmentation header:
Router(config)# nat64 settings fragmentation header disable

To configure the path maximum transmission unit (MTU) size for preventing fragmentation of IPv4 packets for translation to IPv6 using Network Address Translation (NAT64), use the nat64 settings mtu command in interface configuration mode. To disable the MTU size for NAT64, use the no form of this command.

Command History
Release Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10.1a
Additional parameter qualified: mtu .
Usage Guidelines
Path maximum transmission unit (MTU) discovery prevents fragmentation in the path between endpoints. Path MTU discovery is used to dynamically determine the lowest MTU along the path from a packet’s source to its destination. Path MTU discovery is supported only by TCP and UDP. Path MTU discovery is mandatory in IPv6, but it is optional in IPv4. IPv6 devices never fragment a packet—only the sender can fragment packets.
Example
The following example shows how to set the MTU size for NAT64:
Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet1
Router(config-if)# nat64 settings mtu minimum 1500
