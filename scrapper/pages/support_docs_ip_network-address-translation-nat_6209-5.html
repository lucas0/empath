Introduction
This document describes that the order transactions are processed with NAT is based on the direction a packet travels inside or outside the network.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of this topic:
Network Address Translation (NAT). For more information on NAT, see How NAT Works.
Components Used
The information in this document is based on the Cisco IOSÂ® Software Release 12.2(27).
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Conventions
Refer to the Cisco Technical Tips Conventions for more information on document conventions.
Background Information
This document describes that the order in which transactions are processed with Network Address Translation (NAT) is based on whether a packet goes from the inside network to the outside network, or from the outside network to the inside network.
NAT Overview
In this table, when NAT performs the global to local, or local to global, translation is different in each flow.

NAT Configuration and Output
This example demonstrates how the order of operations can effect NAT. In this case, only NAT and routing are shown.
In the previous example, Router-A is configured to translate the inside local address 172.31.200.48 to 172.16.47.150, as shown in this configuration.

The translation table indicates that the intended translation exists.

This output is taken from Router-A with debug ip packet detail  and debug ip nat  enabled, and a ping issued from device 172.31.200.48 destined for 172.16.47.142.
Note: Debug commands generate a significant amount of output. Use them only when traffic on the IP network is low, so other activity on the system is not adversely affected. Before you issue debug  commands, refer to Important Information on Debug Commands.

Since there are no NAT debug messages in the previous output, the current static translation is not used, and that the router does not have a route for the destination address (172.16.47.142) in its routing table. The result of the non-routable packet is an ICMP Unreachable message , which is sent to the inside device.
But, Router-A has a default route of 172.16.47.145, so why is the route considered non-routable?
Router-A has no ip classless configured, which means if a packet destined for a "major" network address (in this case, 172.16.0.0) for which subnets exist in the routing table, the router does not rely on the default route. In other words, if you issue the no ip classless command, this turns off the ability of the router to look for the route with the longest bit match. In order to change this behavior, you have to configure ip classless  on Router-A. The ip classless command is enabled by default on Cisco routers with Cisco IOS Software Releases 11.3 and later.
Router-A#configure terminal
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CTRL/Z.
Router-A(config)#ip classless
Router-A(config)#end

When you repeat the same ping test as previously done, you see that the packet gets translated and the ping is successful.

Router-A#undebug all
All possible debugging has been turned off
The previous example shows that when a packet traverses inside to outside, a NAT router checks its routing table for a route to the outside address before it continues to translate the packet. Therefore, it is important that the NAT router has a valid route for the outside network. The route to the destination network must be known through an interface that is defined as NAT outside in the router configuration.
It is important to note that the return packets are translated before they are routed. Therefore, the NAT router must also have a valid route for the Inside local address in its routing table.
