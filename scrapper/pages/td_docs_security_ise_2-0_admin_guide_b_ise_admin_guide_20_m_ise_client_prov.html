Configure Client Provisioning in Cisco ISE
Enable client provisioning to allow users to download client provisioning resources and configure agent profiles. You can configure agent profiles for Windows clients, Mac OS X clients, and native supplicant profiles for personal devices. If you disable client provisioning, users attempting to access the network will receive a warning message indicating that they are not able to download client provisioning resources.
Before you begin
If you are using a proxy, and hosting client provisioning resources on a remote system, verify that the proxy allows clients to access that remote location.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Administration > System > Settings > Client Provisioning .
Step 2
From the Enable Provisioning drop-down list, choose Enable or Disable .
Step 3
From the Enable Automatic Download drop-down list, choose Enable .
Feed downloads include all the available client provisioning resources.Some of of these resources may not be pertinent to your deployment. Cisco recommends manually downloading resources whenever possible instead of setting this option.
Step 4
Update Feed URL—Specify the URL where Cisco ISE searches for system updates in the Update Feed URL text box. For example, the default URL for downloading client-provisioning resources is https://www.cisco.com/web/secure/pmbu/provisioning-update.xml.
If your network restricts URL-redirection functions (via a proxy server, for example) and you are experiencing difficulty accessing the default URL, try also pointing your Cisco ISE to the following URL: https://www.perfigo.com/ise/provisioning-update.xml.
Step 5
Native Supplicant Provisioning Policy Unavailable—When there is no client provisioning resource for a device, decide here how to proceed in the flow:
Allow Network Access —Users are allowed to register their device on the network without having to install and launch the native supplicant wizard.
Apply Defined Authorization Policy —Users must try to access the Cisco ISE network via standard authentication and authorization policy application (outside of the native supplicant provisioning process). If you enable this option, the user device goes through standard registration according to any client-provisioning policy applied to the user’s ID. If the user’s device requires a certificate to access the Cisco ISE network, you must also provide detailed instructions to the user describing how to obtain and apply a valid certificate using the customizable user-facing text fields, as described in the “Adding a Custom Language Template” section in the Chapter 15, Setting up and Customizing End_User Web Portals.
Step 6
Click Save .
What to do next
Configure client provisioning resource policies.
Client Provisioning Resources
Client provisioning resources are downloaded to endpoints after the endpoint connects to the network. Client provisioning resources consist of compliance and posture agents for desktops, and native supplicant profiles for phones and tablets. Client provisioning policies assign these provisioning resources to endpoints to start a network session.
Client provisioning resources are listed on Policy Elements > Results > Client Provisioning > Resources. The following resource types can be added to the list by clicking the Add button:
Agent resources from Cisco Site—Select the NAC, AnyConnect, and Supplicant Provisioning wizards you want to make available for client provisioning policies. Cisco periodically updates this list of resources, adding new ones and updating existing ones. You can also set up ISE to download all the Cisco resources and resource updates automatically, see Configure Client Provisioning in Cisco ISE for more information.
Agent resources from local disk—Select resources on your PC that you want to upload to ISE, see Add Cisco Provided Client Provisioning Resources from a Local Machine.
AnyConnect Configuration—Select the AnyConnect PC clients that you want to make available for client provisioning. See Create AnyConnect Configuration for more information.
Native Supplicant Profile—Configure a supplicant profile for phones and tablets that contains settings for your network. For more information, see Create Native Supplicant Profiles.
NAC Agent or AnyConnect ISE Posture Profile—Configure the NAC agent and AnyConnect ISE Posture here when you don't want to create and distribute agent XML profiles. For more information about the AnyConnect ISE Posture agent and ISE Posture Profile Editor, see the AnyConnect Administrators Guide for your version of AnyConnect https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/anyconnect-secure-mobility-client/products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html. For more information about the NAC agent profile, see Create an Agent Customization File for the Cisco NAC Agent.
After creating client provisioning resources, create client provisioning policies that apply the client provisioning resources to the endpoints. See Configure Client Provisioning Resource Policies.

When you enter the SOURCEfire URL in the Windows or MAC Installer text box and click Check, you might encounter any of the following errors:
Error Message: The certificate for the server containing the Mac/Windows installer file is not trusted by ISE. Add a trust certificate to Administration > Certificates > Trusted Certificates.
This error message appears if you have not imported the SOURCEfire trusted certificate in to the Cisco ISE certificate store. Obtain a SOURCEfire trusted certificate and import it in to the Cisco ISE trusted certificate store (Administration > Certificates > Trusted Certificates).
Error Message: The installer file is not found at this location, this may be due to a connection issue. Enter a valid path in the Installer text box or check your connection.
This error message appears when the server hosting the AMP for Endpoint software is down or if there is a typographic error in the Windows Installer or MAC Installer text box.
Error Message: The Windows/Mac installer text box does not contain a valid URL.
This error message appears when you enter a syntactically incorrect URL format.
Create AnyConnect Configuration
AnyConnect configuration includes AnyConnect software and its associated configuration files. This configuration can be used in the client provisioning policy that allows users to download and install AnyConnect resources on the clients. If you use both ISE and an ASA to deploy AnyConnect, then the configurations must match on both headends.
To push the ISE posture module when connected to a VPN, Cisco recommends that you install the AnyConnect agent through Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), which uses the Cisco's Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) GUI tool. ASA does the installation using the VPN downloader. With the download, the ISE posture profile is pushed via ASA, and the discovery host needed for later provisioning the profile is available before the ISE posture module contacts ISE. Whereas with ISE, the ISE posture module will get the profile only after ISE is discovered, which could result in errors. Therefore, ASA is recommended to push the ISE posture module when connected to a VPN.

Note
When Cisco ISE is integrated with ASA, ensure that the Accounting mode is set to Single in ASA. Accounting data is sent to only one accounting server in Single mode.
Before you begin
Before configuring an AnyConnect configuration object, you must:
Download the AnyConnect Headend Deployment package and compliance module from Cisco Software download page.
Upload these resources to Cisco ISE (see Add Cisco Provided Client Provisioning Resources from a Local Machine).
(Optional) Add the customization and localization bundles (see Add Customer Created Resources for AnyConnect from a Local Machine).
Configure an AnyConnect posture agent profile (see Create a Posture Agent Profile).
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Policy > Policy Elements > Results > Client Provision > Resources.
Step 2
Click Add to create an AnyConnect configuration.
Step 3
Choose AnyConnect Configuration.
Step 4
Choose an AnyConnect Package, which you previously uploaded. For example, AnyConnectDesktopWindows xxx.x.xxxxx.x.
Step 5
Enter the name for the current AnyConnect Configuration. For example, AC Config xxx.x.xxxxx.x.
Step 6
Choose the compliance module, which you previously uploaded. For example, AnyConnectComplianceModulewindows x.x.xxxx.x
Step 7
Check one or more AnyConnect modules check boxes. For example, choose one or more modules from the following: ISE Posture, VPN, Network Access Manager, Web Security, AMP Enabler, ASA Posture, Start Before Log on (only for Windows OS), and Diagnostic and Reporting Tool.
Note 
Un-checking the VPN module under AnyConnect Module Selection does not disable the VPN tile in the provisioned client. You must configure VPNDisable_ServiceProfile.xml to disable the VPN tile on AnyConnect GUI. In a system where AnyConnect is installed at the default location, you can find this file under C:\Program Files\Cisco. If AnyConnect is installed at a different location, then the file will be available under <AnyConnect Installed path>\Cisco.

The navigation path for this page is Policy > Policy Elements > Resilts > Client Provisioning > Resources > Add > NAC or AnyConnect Posture Profile.
Field
Default Value
Mode (Applies only to Cisco NAC Agent)
Usage Guidelines
VLAN detection interval
0, 5
Merge
This setting is the interval at which the agent check for the VLAN change.
For the Windows NAC agent, the default value is 0. By default, the access to authentication VLAN change feature is disabled for Windows. The valid range is 0 to 5 seconds.
For the Mac OS X agent, the default value is 5. By default, the access to authentication VLAN change feature is enabled with VlanDetectInteval as 5 seconds for Mac OS X. The valid range is 5 to 900 seconds.
0 —Access to Authentication VLAN change feature is disabled.
1 to 5—Agent sends an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) or Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) query every 5 seconds.
6 to 900—An ICMP or ARP query is sent every x seconds.
Enable VLAN detection without UI (Not applicable for a Mac OS X client)
No
Merge
This setting enables or disables VLAN detection even when the user is not logged in.
No—VLAN detect feature is disabled.
Yes—VLAN detect feature is enabled.
Retry detection count
3
Merge
If the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) or Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) polling fails, this setting configures the agent to retry x times before refreshing the client IP address.
Ping or ARP
0
The valid range is 0 to 2.
Merge
This setting specifies the method used for detecting the client IP address change.
0—Poll using ICMP
1—Poll using ARP
2—Poll using ICMP first, then (if ICMP fails) ARP
Maximum timeout for ping
1
The valid range is 1 to 10 seconds.
Merge
Poll using ICMP, and if there is no response within the specified time, then declare an ICMP polling failure.
Enable agent IP refresh
Yes (Default)
Overwrite
This setting specifies whether or not the client machine to renew or refresh its IP address after the switch (or WLC) changes the VLAN for the login session of the client on the respective switch port.
DHCP renew delay
0
The valid range is 0 to 60 seconds.
Overwrite
This setting specifies that the client machine waits before attempting to request for a new IP address from the network DHCP server.
DHCP release delay
0
The valid range is 0 to 60 seconds.
Overwrite
The setting specifies that the client machine waits before releasing its current IP address.

Note
Merge parameter values with existing agent profile settings or overwrite them to appropriately configure clients on Windows and Mac OS X clients for refreshing IP addresses.
Posture Protocol Settings
Client Login Session Criteria
Cisco ISE looks at various elements when classifying the type of login session through which users access the internal network, including:
Client machine operating system and version
Client machine browser type and version
Group to which the user belongs
Condition evaluation results (based on applied dictionary attributes)
After Cisco ISE classifies a client machine, it uses client provisioning resource policies to ensure that the client machine is set up with an appropriate agent version, up-to-date compliance modules for antivirus and antispyware vendor support, and correct agent customization packages and profiles, if necessary.
Agent Download Issues on Client Machine
Agent Download Issues on Client Machine
Problem
The client machine browser displays a “no policy matched” error message after user authentication and authorization. This issue applies to user sessions during the client provisioning phase of authentication.
Possible Causes
The client provisioning policy is missing required settings.
Posture Agent Download Issues
Remember that downloading the posture agent installer requires the following:
The user must allow the ActiveX installer in the browser session the first time an agent is installed on the client machine. (The client provisioning download page prompts for this.)
The client machine must have Internet access.
Resolution
Ensure that a client provisioning policy exists in Cisco ISE. If yes, verify the policy identity group, conditions, and type of agent(s) defined in the policy. (Also ensure whether or not there is any agent profile configured under Policy > Policy Elements > Results > Client Provisioning > ResourcesAddNAC or AnyConnect Posture Profile, even a profile with all default values.)
Try re-authenticating the client machine by bouncing the port on the access switch.
Provision Client Machines with the Cisco NAC Agent MSI Installer
You can place the MSI installer in a directory or a zip version of the same installer on the client machine along with an Agent configuration XML file (named NACAgentCFG.xml ) containing the appropriate Agent profile information required to coincide with your network.
Procedure
Step 1
Download the nacagentsetup-win.msi or nacagentsetup-win.zip installer file from the Cisco Software Download site from http://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html and navigate to Security > Access Control and Policy > Cisco Identityt Services Engine > Cisco Identity Services Engine Software > Release 1.x.
Step 2
Place the nacagentsetup-win.msi file in a specific directory on the client machine (for example, C:\temp\nacagentsetup-win.msi):
If you are copying the MSI installer directly over to the client, place the nacagentsetup-win.msi file into a directory on the client machine from which you plan to install the Cisco NAC Agent.
If you are using the nacagentsetup-win.zip installer, extract the contents of the zip file into the directory on the client machine from which you plan to install the Cisco  NAC Agent.
Step 3
Place an Agent configuration XML file in the same directory as the Cisco NAC Agent MSI package.
If you are not connected to Cisco ISE, you can copy the NACAgentCFG.xml file from a client that has already been successfully provisioned. The file is located at C:\Program Files\Cisco\Cisco NAC Agent\NACAgentCFG.xml .
As long as the Agent configuration XML file exists in the same directory as the MSI installer package, the installation process automatically places the Agent configuration XML file in the appropriate Cisco NAC Agent application directory so that the agent can point to the correct Layer 3 network location when it is first launched.
Step 4
Open a Command prompt on the client machine and enter the following to execute the installation:
msiexec.exe /i NACAgentSetup-win.msi /qn /l*v c:\temp\agent-install.log
(The /qn qualifier installs the Cisco NAC Agent completely silently. The /l*v logs the installation session in verbose mode.)
To uninstall the NAC Agent, you can execute the following command:
msiexec /x NACAgentSetup-win-<version>.msi /qn
Installing a new version of the Agent using MSI will uninstall the old version and install the new version using the above commands.
Step 5
If you are using Altiris/SMS to distribute the MSI installer, place the Agent customization files in a sub-directory named “brand” in the directory “%TEMP%/CCAA”. When the Cisco NAC Agent is installed in the client, the customization is applied to the Agent. To remove the customization, send a plain MSI without the customization files.
Cisco ISE Posture Agents
Posture agents are applications that reside on client machines logging into the Cisco ISE network. Agents can be persistent (like the AnyConnect, Cisco NAC Agent for Windows and Mac OS X) and remain on the client machine after installation, even when the client is not logged into the network. Agents can also be temporal (like the Cisco NAC Web Agent, ), removing themselves from the client machine after the login session has terminated. In either case, the Agent helps the user to log in to the network, receive the appropriate access profile, and even perform posture assessment on the client machine to ensure it complies with network security guidelines before accessing the core of the network.

Note
Currently Cisco NAC Agent and Cisco NAC Web Agent support Client Provisioning Portal and Native Supplicant Provisioning. Cisco NAC Web Agent supports Central Web Authentication flow (CWA), but Cisco NAC Agent does not support CWA.
Posture Agent Discovery Request and Cisco ISE Response
Web Agent Posture Discovery Request and Cisco ISE Response
Agent Displays “Temporary Access”
Agent Fails to Initiate Posture Assessment
Posture Agent Discovery Request and Cisco ISE Response
Cisco ISE supports coexistence of AnyConnect and legacy Cisco ISE NAC agents on Windows and Mac OS x clients. Agents start the posture discovery probe only when there is any change in the network on the clients. Cisco ISE responds to the client's posture discovery probe based on the client provisioning policy and the corresponding agent will get the discovery response, which results in only one agent being active.
Based on the client provisioning policy, Cisco ISE differs in responding to the agents posture discovery probe as below:
If the endpoint is configured to use the legacy agent (Cisco ISE NAC agent for Windows and Mac OS x), the agent receives the discovery response with a string "X-perfigo-CAS=FQDN" in the existing format. AnyConnect stops discovery, if the discovery response is received for the legacy agent.
If the endpoint is configured to use AnyConnect, Cisco ISE responds in a different format. This will be the Cisco ISE Policy Service node FQDN and the AnyConnect Configuration URL, AnyConnect package location and version based on the client provisioning policy. The legacy agent stops discovery, if the response is received for AnyConnect.

Note
MAC OSX devices do not send requests to default gateway. These devices use only the following two probes:
discovery host
enroll.cisco.com
Ensure that you have configured correct DNS on MAC OSX devices to resolve enroll.cisco.com.
Web Agent Posture Discovery Request and Cisco ISE Response
The Web agent does not do discovery probe. If an endpoint is configured to use the Web agent, Cisco ISE responds using the format, X-ISE-PDP-WEBAGENT=FQDN". The webagent discovery response invokes the Cisco NAC Agent on the client, if the client provisioning policy is configured to use the Web agent.
Agent Displays “Temporary Access”
Problem
A client machine is granted “Temporary Access” to the network following login and authentication, but administrator and users expect full network access.
Possible Causes
This issue is applicable to any client machine login session using an agent to connect.
If the Cisco Agent is running on the client and:
The interface on the client machine goes down
The session is terminated
Resolution
The user must try to verify network connectivity and then try to log in again (and pass through posture assessment, as well) to attempt to reestablish the connection.
Agent Fails to Initiate Posture Assessment
Problem
The user is presented with a “Clean access server not available” message. This issue applies to any agent authentication session from Cisco ISE.
Possible Cause
This error could mean that either the session has terminated or Cisco ISE is no longer reachable on the network.
Resolution
The user can try to log into the network again.
The user can try to ping the default gateway or the RADIUS server IP address or FQDN supplied by the network administrator.
The administrator can check network access attributes for the user (like the assigned VLAN, ACLs, routing, execute the nslookup command on the client, client machine DNS connection, and so on).
Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility
Cisco ISE uses an integrated module in AnyConnect for Cisco ISE posture requirements. AnyConnect is the posture agent that coexists with Cisco ISE NAC Agent on the same endpoint. Only one of the agents is active at a time.

Note
Cisco AnyConnect does not support CWA flow. You can't provision AnyConnect from the Guest portal using the Require guest device compliance field in the Guest Access > Configure > Guest Portals > Create, Edit, or Duplicate > Portal Behavior and Flow Settings > Guest Device Compliance Settings page. Instead, provision AnyConnect on the Client Provisioning portal. That method results in redirection as configured in authorization permissions.
When you integrate Cisco ISE with the AnyConnect agent, Cisco ISE:
Serves as a staging server to deploy AnyConnect Version 4.0 and future releases
Interacts with the AnyConnect posture component for Cisco ISE posture requirements
Supports deployment of AnyConnect profiles, customization and language packages, and OPSWAT library updates for Windows and Mac OS X operating systems
Supports AnyConnect and legacy agents at the same time
Cisco NAC Agent XML File Installation Directories
In a system where the Cisco NAC Agent installed at the default location, you can find the following .xml files in the following directories:
The nac_login.xml file is available in the “C:\Program Files\Cisco\Cisco NAC Agent\UI\nac_divs\login” directory.
In the nacStrings_xx.xml file, the “xx” indicates the locale. You can find a complete list of the files in the “C:\Program Files\Cisco\Cisco NAC Agent\UI\cues_utility” directory.
If the agent is installed at a different location, then the files would be available at “<Agent Installed path>\Cisco\Cisco NAC Agent\UI\nac_divs\login” and “<Agent Installed path>\Cisco\Cisco NAC Agent\cues_utility”.
Cisco NAC Agent for Windows Clients
The Cisco NAC Agent provides the posture assessment and remediation for client machines.
Users can download and install the Cisco NAC Agent (read-only client software), which can check the host registry, processes, applications, and services. The Cisco NAC Agent can be used to perform Windows updates or antivirus and antispyware definition updates, launch qualified remediation programs, distribute files uploaded to the Cisco ISE server, distribute website links to web sites for users to download files to fix their system, or simply distribute information and instructions.
Cisco strongly recommends that you ensure that the latest Windows hotfixes and patches are installed on Windows XP clients so that the Cisco NAC Agent can establish a secure and encrypted communication with Cisco ISE (via SSL over TCP).

Cisco NAC Agent for Macintosh Clients
The Cisco NAC OS X Agent provides the posture assessment and remediation for Macintosh client machines.
Users can download and install the Cisco NAC OS X Agent (read-only client software), which can check antivirus and antispyware definition updates.
After users log in to the Cisco NAC OS X Agent, the agent gets the requirements that are configured for the user role and the operating system from the Cisco ISE server, checks for required packages and sends a report back to the Cisco ISE server. If requirements are met on the client, the user is allowed network access. If requirements are not met, the agent presents a dialog to the user for each requirement that is not satisfied. The dialog provides the user with instructions and the action to take for the client machine to meet the requirement. Alternatively, if the specified requirements are not met, users can choose to accept restricted network access while the user tries to remediate the client system.
Uninstall the Cisco NAC Agent from Macintosh Clients

Cisco Web Agent
The Cisco Web Agent provides temporal posture assessment for client machines.
Users can launch the Cisco Web Agent executable, which installs the Web Agent files in a temporary directory on the client machine via ActiveX control or Java applet.
After users log in to the Cisco Web Agent, the Web Agent gets the requirements that are configured for the user role and the operating system from the Cisco ISE server, checks the host registry, processes, applications, and services for required packages and sends a report back to the Cisco ISE server. If requirements are met on the client machine, the user is allowed network access. If requirements are not met, the Web Agent presents a dialog to the user for each requirement that is not satisfied. The dialog provides the user with instructions and the action to take for the client machine to meet the requirement. Alternatively, if the specified requirements are not met, users can choose to accept the restricted network access while they try to remediate the client system so that it meets requirements for the user login role.

Note
ActiveX is supported only on the 32-bit versions of Internet Explorer. You cannot install ActiveX on a Firefox web browser or on a 64-bit version of Internet Explorer.

Assemble the files required to comprise your Agent screen customization package:
Customized nac_login.xml file
Customized corporate/company logo as a .gif file
One or more customized nacStrings_xx.xml files
Customized updateFeed.xml descriptor file
Step 2
Create a zip file called “brand-win.zip” that contains the assembled files. For example, in a Linux or Unix environment, execute the following: zip -r brand-win.zip nac_login.xml nac_logo.gif nacStrings_en.xml nacStrings_cy.xml nacStrings_el.xml
Step 3
Create a “custom.zip” file that contains an appropriate updateFeed.xml descriptor file and the .zip file created above. For example, in a Linux or Unix environment, execute the following: zip -r custom.zip updateFeed.xml brand-win.zip
Step 4
Save the resulting “custom.zip” file to a location on a local machine that you can access when uploading the file to Cisco ISE.

Note
This file also contains two static (that is, uneditable by the user or Cisco ISE administrator) “AgentCfgVersion” and “AgentBrandVersion” parameters used to identify the current version of the agent profile and agent customization file, respectively, on the client.
Configure Client Provisioning Resource Policies
For clients, the client provisioning resource policies determine which users receive which version (or versions) of resources (agents, agent compliance modules, and/or agent customization packages/profiles) from Cisco ISE upon login and user session initiation.
For AnyConnect, resources can be selected either from the client provisioning resources page to create an AnyConnect configuration that you can use in the client provisioning policy page. AnyConnect configuration is the AnyConnect software and its association with different configuration files that includes AnyConnect binary package for Windows and Mac OS X clients, compliance module. module profiles, customization and language packages for AnyConnect.
For Cisco ISE NAC agents, resources can be selected from the client provisioning policy page.
Before you begin
Before you can create effective client-provisioning resource policies, ensure that you have added resources to Cisco ISE. When you download the agent compliance module, it always overwrites the existing one, if any, available in the system.
Check the native supplicant profile that is used in the client provisioning policy and ensure that the wireless SSID is correct. For iOS devices, if the network that you are trying to connect to is hidden, check the Enable if target network is hidden check box from the iOS Settings area.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Policy > Client Provisioning.
Step 2
Choose Enable , Disable , or Monitor from the behavior drop-down list:
Enable —Ensures Cisco ISE uses this policy to help fulfill client-provisioning functions when users log in to the network and conform to the client-provisioning policy guidelines.
Disable —Cisco ISE does not use the specified resource policy to fulfill client-provisioning functions.
Monitor —Disables the policy and “watches” the client-provisioning session requests to see how many times Cisco ISE tries to invoke based on the “Monitored” policy.
Step 3
Enter a name for the new resource policy in the Rule Name text box.
Step 4
Specify one or more Identity Groups to which a user who logs into Cisco ISE might belong.
You can choose to specify the Any identity group type, or choose one or more groups from a list of existing Identity Groups that you have configured.
Step 5
Use the Operating Systems field to specify one or more operating systems that might be running on the client machine or device through which the user is logging into Cisco ISE.
You can choose to specify a single operating system like "Android" , "Mac iOS', and "Mac OS X" or an umbrella operating system designation that addresses a number of client machine operating systems like "Windows XP (All)" or "Windows 7 (All)."
Step 6
In the Other Conditions field, specify a new expression that you want to create for this particular resource policy.
Step 7
For client machines, use Agent Configuration to specify which agent type, compliance module, agent customization package, and/or profile to make available and provision on the client machine.
It is mandatory to include the client provisioning URL in authorization policy, to enable the Agent to popup in the client machines. This prevents request from any random clients and ensures that only clients with proper redirect URL can request for posture assessment.
Step 8
Click Save .
What to do next
Once you have successfully configured one or more client provisioning resource policies, you can start to configure Cisco ISE to perform posture assessment on client machines during login.

Configure Cisco ISE Posture Agent in the Client Provisioning Policy
For client machines, configure the agent type, compliance module, agent customization package, and/or profile to make available and provision for users to download and install on the client machine.
Before you begin
You must add client provisioning resources for AnyConnect and Cisco ISE NAC in Cisco ISE.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose an available agent from the Agent drop-down list and specify whether the agent upgrade (download) defined here is mandatory for the client machine by enabling or disabling the Is Upgrade Mandatory option, as appropriate.
The Is Upgrade Mandatory setting only applies to agent downloads. Agent profile, compliance module, and Agent customization package updates are always mandatory.
Step 2
Choose an existing agent profile from the Profile drop-down list.
Step 3
Choose an available compliance module to download to the client machine using the Compliance Module drop-down list.
Step 4
Choose an available agent customization package for the client machine from the Agent Customization Package drop-down list.
Configure Native Supplicants for Personal Devices
Employees can connect their personal devices to the network directly using native supplicants, which are available for Windows, Mac OS, iOS, and Android devices. For personal devices, specify which Native Supplicant configuration to make available and provision on the registered personal device.
Before you begin
Create native supplicant profiles so that when user log in, based on the profile that you associate with that users authorization requirements , Cisco ISE provides the necessary supplicant provisioning wizard to set up the users personal devices to access the network.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Policy > Client Provisioning.
Step 2
Choose Enable , Disable , or Monitor from the behavior drop-down list:
Step 3
Enter a name for the new resource policy in the Rule Name text box.
Step 4
Specify the following:
Use the Identity Groups field to specify one or more Identity Groups to which a user who logs into Cisco ISE might belong.
Use the Operating System field to specify one or more operating systems that might be running on the personal device through which the user is logging into Cisco ISE.
Use the Other Conditions field to specify a new expression that you want to create for this particular resource policy.
Step 5
For personal devices, use Native Supplicant Configuration to choose the specific Configuration Wizard to distribute to these personal devices.
Step 6
Specify the applicable Wizard Profile for the given personal device type.
Step 7
Click Save.
Client Provisioning Reports
You can access the Cisco ISE monitoring and troubleshooting functions to check on overall trends for successful or unsuccessful user login sessions, gather statistics about the number and types of client machines logging into the network during a specified time period, or check on any recent configuration changes in client provisioning resources.
Client Provisioning Requests
The Operations > ReportsISE ReportsEndpoints and UsersClient Provisioning report displays statistics about successful and unsuccessful client provisioning requests. When you choose Run and specify one of the preset time periods, Cisco ISE combs the database and displays the resulting client provisioning data.
Supplicant Provisioning Requests
The Operations > Reports > ISE Reports > Endpoints and Users > Supplicant Provisioning window displays information about recent successful and unsuccessful user device registration and supplicant provisioning requests. When you choose Run and specify one of the preset time periods, Cisco ISE combs the database and displays the resulting supplicant provisioning data.
The Supplicant Provisioning report provides information about a list of endpoints that are registered through the device registration portal for a specific period of time, including data like the Logged at Date and Time, Identity (user ID), IP Address, MAC Address (endpoint ID), Server, profile, Endpoint Operating System, SPW Version, Failure Reason (if any), and the Status of the registration.
Client Provisioning Event Logs
You can search event log entries to help diagnose a possible problem with client login behavior. For example, you may need to determine the source of an issue where client machines on your network are not able to get client provisioning resource updates upon login. You can use logging entries for Posture and Client Provisioning Audit and Posture and Client Provisioning Diagnostics.
