Defect ID Headline
CSCwc36589 ISE Intune MDM integration may disrupt due to End of Support for MAC Address-Based APIs from Intune
Problem Description
For all wired, wireless, and VPN deployment scenarios, Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) Release 3.0 or earlier will no longer be able to obtain registration or compliance information from the Microsoft Intune Mobile Device Management (MDM) integration. In addition, all releases of ISE will no longer be able to obtain registration or compliance information from Microsoft Intune via Unique Device Identifier-based (UDID) queries.
Background
Microsoft will deprecate the Intune Network Access Control (NAC) service API on December 31, 2023. This API supports MAC address and UDID-based queries. Once deprecated, all queries from ISE to Intune will need to utilize the Microsoft Compliance Retrieval API. Microsoft's Compliance Retrieval API currently only supports a Global Unique Identifier (GUID) as the unique identifier, but is expected to also support MAC address-based queries from approximately the middle of 2023.
ISE integrates with Microsoft Intune in order to determine corporate asset ownership or registration, as well as security compliance. In releases earlier than ISE 3.1, integration was done with the Cisco ISE MDM APIv2 via the Intune NAC service, which used the MAC address or UDID (in the case of VPN flows where the MAC address was not available) of the endpoint as the means of endpoint identification. ISE 3.1 introduced MDM APIv3 which also supports the use of a GUID for endpoint identification during MDM queries. Microsoft Intune supports this with their Compliance Retrieval API. In order for ISE to be able to query an MDM using a GUID rather than a MAC address, a deployment must:
Run ISE 3.1 or later.
For wired and wireless flows, be configured for MDM-managed endpoints to authenticate to the network using a certificate-based authentication mechanism, where the GUID is embedded in the certificate.
For VPN flows, GUID-based queries are not supported for MDM integrations. Queries must be based on either the UDID or MAC address. In order to continue interoperability with Microsoft Intune beyond December 31, 2023, only MAC address-based queries should be used. This requires both Cisco ISE and Microsoft Intune to be aware of the endpoint’s MAC address.
As some operating system vendors begin to limit the ability of applications to access MAC addresses, it becomes more of a challenge for MDM vendors to collect and rely on MAC addresses on these platforms. As a result, although MAC address-based queries will be supported through the use of Microsoft's Compliance Retrieval API from the middle of 2023, due to limitations imposed by the operating system vendors with later versions of operating systems, there will likely be more endpoints without MAC addresses known to the MDM. Therefore, for wired and wireless-based endpoints, although MAC address-based queries will be supported, if the MAC address is not known to Intune then no valid response will be received. For this reason, Microsoft and Cisco strongly recommends the use of ISE Release 3.1 or later together with GUID-based queries embedded in the certificate.
This limitation is also seen for VPN-based endpoints where the MAC address is discovered by the VPN client rather than the network infrastructure. For these endpoints, due to the deprecation of the NAC Service API, which is the only API that supports UDID-based queries as the alternative identifier for VPN endpoints, it will not be possible to check their registration or compliance status with Microsoft Intune.
For further information, refer to New Microsoft Intune service for network access control.
Problem Symptom
Once Microsoft deprecates the NAC service API (planned for December 31, 2023), for ISE Release 3.0 or earlier, or any ISE 3.1 or later deployment using MDM APIv2 Microsoft Intune integration, the API queries to Intune will fail and Intune managed endpoints will appear as “not-registered.” ISE will also trigger an alarm which indicates the Intune API is unreachable.
Workaround/Solution
In order to continue to use the Microsoft Intune MDM integration, complete these steps:
Upgrade the ISE software to ISE Release 3.1 or later.
Configure the use of MDM APIv3 Microsoft Intune integration. This includes the deployment of certificates to all Intune registered wired and wireless connected endpoints and confirmation that those certificates are used for network authentication. For further information, see the Integrate MDM and UEM Servers with Cisco ISE Configuration Guide.
For VPN-based endpoints, rely solely on the MAC address as the unique identifier with the MDM. This might not be possible with later versions of some operating systems which prevent access by applications to the MAC address. When this is not possible, until a holistic solution is available that replaces the use of a UDID for integration with Intune, customers might choose to use ISE posture in order to check for security compliance as an alternative to verification against Intune. Refer to the ISE Posture Prescriptive Deployment Guide for further information.
If you also use another MDM, you can integrate it with Cisco ISE with MAC addresses as the basis for the integration. Refer to the ISE Administrator Guide for further information.
