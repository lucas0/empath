Overview
The Cisco RFGW-10 DS-48 card is similar to the traditional QAM solutions where the card receives encapsulated data, de-packetizes/re-formats the packets, maps them to the output QAM channel, and performs QAM modulation and frequency upconversion. From a high level, the DS-48 line card receives Video and DOCSIS data encapsulated over Ethernet and outputs analog QAM data to the subscriber devices (STB, DOCSIS modems).
As a DOCSIS engine, the Cisco RFGW-10 DS-48 line card supports DEPI D-MPT mode (future SW releases may support PSP mode). DEPI is based on the L2TPv3 protocol, which includes a data plane and a control plane. DEPI data plane traffic is terminated at the line card. The Cisco RFGW-10 Supervisor terminates DEPI control and communicates the control to each line card in the system via the chassis IPC infrastructure. DOCSIS timing information (10.24MHz synchronous DTI clock) is received by the line card from the system TCC cards.
As a video engine, the Cisco RFGW-10 DS-48 terminates video data path traffic forwarded from the Supervisor Engine (video control plane traffic is terminated and processed by the system Supervisor). The Cisco RFGW-10 DS-48 processing path classifies video packets, performs inter QAM processing, bitrate scheduling, program muxing/scheduling, PID remapping, PCR re-stamping, and CC re-stamping.
A critical feature for the Cisco RFGW-10 DS-48 line card is redundancy and high availability support. The line cards are designed to detect and react to a wide range of faults and failures and respond with sub-second failover to a dedicated protect card.
The Cisco RFGW-10 DS-48 line card is designed to support a wide range of line card health conditions and initiate failover events if considered catastrophic:
QAM or upconverter hardware failure. The line card monitors both the digital and RF data integrity. The modules also provide a comprehensive alarm structure to the system CPU, which allows constant monitoring of the UPX
Environmental alarms (temperature, voltage, frequency)
Software kernel failures
Software module failure
DTI Clock or Timing failures (both internal and external)
SFP failures
Cisco RFGW-10 DS-48 Line Card Components
The Cisco RFGW-10 DS-48 line card has 12 physical RF ports, which support up to four QAMs per port. The number of QAM outputs is configurable on a per port basis (meaning an individual port can support 1, 2, or 4 QAMs as well as muting of individual QAMs within a QAM group). In stacked QAM mode, the QAMs are stacked contiguously over a 24-MHz or 32-MHz band. The line card supports a downstream channel frequency range of 88 MHz to 870 MHz.
The front panel has two 1xGigabit Ethernet ports and a single DVB-ASI interface (covers all video output streams). The front panel connectors support both copper and fiber SFP modules. The front panel Gigabit Ethernet ports are not processed directly by the line card, these are independent of the line card and route directly to the Supervisor switch fabric. These ports do not become out of service if the line card crashes and a failover to the redundant card occurs.

Safety Information and Warnings
Electrical Equipment Guidelines
Before beginning any procedures requiring access to the chassis interior, locate the emergency power-off switch for the room in which you are working.
Disconnect all power and external cables before moving a chassis.
Do not work alone when potentially hazardous conditions exist.
Never assume that power has been disconnected from a circuit; always check.
Do not perform any action that creates a potential hazard to people or makes the equipment unsafe.
Carefully examine your work area for possible hazards such as moist floors, ungrounded power extension cables, and missing safety grounds.
Preventing Electrostatic Discharge Damage
Electrostatic discharge (ESD) damage, occurs when electronic cards or components are improperly handled and can result in complete or intermittent failures. All line cards consist of a printed circuit card that is fixed in a metal carrier. Electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and connectors are integral components of the carrier. Although the metal carrier helps to protect the cards from ESD, use an antistatic strap each time you handle the modules. Handle the carriers by the edges only; never touch the cards or connector pins.

Caution
Always tighten the captive installation screws on all system components when you are installing them. These screws prevent accidental removal of the module, provide proper grounding for the system, and help to ensure that the line card connectors are properly seated in the backplane. Captive screws should be torqued to 6-8 in-lbs to ensure proper grounding and mechanical support. Never use cordless or corded drills to tighten screws; power screwdrivers and hand tools are acceptable.
Static electricity can harm delicate components inside your system. To prevent static damage, discharge static electricity from your body before you touch any of your system components. As you continue to work on your system, periodically touch an unpainted metal surface on the computer chassis.
Following guidelines can prevent ESD damage:
Always use an ESD-preventive wrist or ankle strap and ensure that it makes good skin contact. Before removing a card from the chassis, connect the equipment end of the strap to the ESD plug at the bottom of the chassis below the power entry modules. Ensure that the chassis or rack or both have a grounding cable installed.
Handle line cards by the faceplate and carrier edges only; avoid touching the card components or any connector pins.
When removing a card, place the removed module component-side-up on an antistatic surface or in a static-shielding bag. If the module will be returned to the factory, immediately place it in a static-shielding bag.
Avoid contact between the modules and clothing. The wrist-strap protects the card from ESD voltages on the body only; ESD voltages on clothing can still cause damage.
When transporting a sensitive component, first place it an antistatic container or packaging.
Handle all sensitive components in a static-safe area. If possible, use antistatic floor pads and workbench pads.

Caution
For safety, periodically check the resistance value of the antistatic strap. The measurement should be between 1 and 10 megohms.
