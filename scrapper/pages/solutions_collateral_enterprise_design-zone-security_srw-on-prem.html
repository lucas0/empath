Introduction
Today’s distributed workforce continues to grow, and new challenges arise for businesses of all sizes. The need to have secure remote workers access cloud, private data centers, and public internet resources is even more important now than it has been in the past. While the benefits of these resources are immense, so are the risks that come with using them.
The IT teams need to be able to trust that their users can access all these resources with minimal interactions, while being as secure as possible. To do this, we need to protect the endpoints users will be on, the connection from these devices, validate their identity, and protect data from threats.

Secure Remote Worker Architecture
Remote workers access enterprise resources using Internet connections protected by remote access VPN (RAVPN). Internet edge is an essential segment in the enterprise network, where the corporate network meets the public Internet. The SAFE Model identifies the Internet edge as one of the places in the network (PINs). SAFE simplifies complexity across the enterprise by implementing a model that focuses on the areas that a company must secure. This model treats each area holistically, focusing on today’s threats and the capabilities needed to secure each area against those threats. Cisco has deployed, tested, and validated critical designs. These solutions provide guidance and best practices that ensure effective, secure remote access to the resources.
Figure 2.              Key to SAFE organizes the complexity of holistic security into PINs & Secure Domain
  The Internet edge is the highest-risk PIN because it is the primary ingress for public traffic and the primary egress point to the Internet. Simultaneously, it is the critical resource that businesses need in today’s Internet-based economy. SAFE matches up defensive capabilities against the categories of threats today. SAFE simplifies security by starting with business flows, then addressing their respective threats with corresponding security capabilities, architectures, and designs. SAFE provides guidance that is holistic and understandable.
Figure 3.              SAFE Architecture and Design Guides
  More information about how Cisco SAFE simplifies security, along with other CVDs, can be found here.
Secure Remote Worker Business Flows
Business Flow: SAFE uses the concept of business flows to simplify the identification of threats, and this enables the selection of capabilities necessary to protect them. The Secure Remote Worker design guide focuses on remote users accessing applications hosted in a secured environment. There is a secondary focus on securing the user when accessing internet resources, however, more in depth details are explored in the Cisco Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) Design Guide.
Figure 4.              Remote Access VPN Business Flows
  Threat Capabilities: Not all business flows have the same requirements. Some use cases are subject to a smaller attack vector and therefore require less security. Some have multiple vectors and require more. Evaluating the business flow by analyzing the attack surfaces provides the information needed to determine and apply the correct capabilities for flow specific and effective security. This process also allows for the application of capabilities to address risk and administrative policy requirements. For more information regarding SAFE capabilities, refer to the SAFE Overview Guide.

Solution Overview
Today’s companies are investing in enabling their workforce to have a secure remote connection to the resources hosted in their private data centers. This Cisco validated design guide (CVD) addresses a specific use case of secure remote workers covered in the Secure Remote Worker SAFE Design Guide. The secure remote worker solution uses the Cisco Secure VPN, Cisco Secure Firewall, Cisco Secure Access by Duo, Cisco Umbrella, and Cisco Secure Endpoint.
Remote access VPN key capabilities for traffic and threat management
Static Split Tunnel versus Dynamic Split Tunnel
The default behavior of a VPN client is to tunnel all traffic. The client sends everything through the tunnel unless the split tunnel is defined. Split tunnels are of two types static and dynamic.
Figure 6.              Remote employee accessing resources hosted in the data center (tunnel-all)
Static Split Tunnel
Static split tunneling involves defining the IP addresses of hosts and networks that should be included in or excluded from the remote access VPN tunnel. The limitation of the static split tunnel is that it is based on IP addresses defined in the split tunnel ACL. You can enhance split tunneling by defining dynamic split tunneling.
Dynamic Split Tunnel
With dynamic split tunneling, you can fine-tune split tunneling based on DNS domain names. Because the IP addresses associated with full-qualified domain names (FQDN) can change or simply differ based on region, defining split tunneling based on DNS names provides a more dynamic definition of which traffic should, or should not, be included in the remote access VPN tunnel. If any addresses returned for excluded domain names are within the address pool included in the VPN, those addresses will then be excluded.
Figure 7.              Traffic destined for private subnets/domains are sent through the VPN tunnel, other traffic goes direct to the Internet
VPN with a split tunnel
Cisco Secure VPN modules provide protection when users are on a VPN with a split tunnel enabled.

Cisco Secure Access by Duo
Cisco Secure Access by Duo is a user-friendly, scalable way to keep business ahead of ever-changing security threats by implementing part of the Zero Trust security model. Multi-factor authentication from Duo protects the network by using a second source of validation, like a phone or token, to verify user identity before granting access. Duo is engineered to provide a simple, streamlined login experience for every remote user. As a cloud-based solution, it integrates easily with your existing technology and provides administration, visibility, and monitoring.
Cisco Secure Access by Duo integrates with Cisco FTD VPN to add two-factor authentication for Secure VPN logins. Duo supports two-factor authentication for FTD using RADIUS authentication. With this configuration, end-users receive an automatic push or phone call for multi-factor authentication after submitting their primary credentials using the Secure VPN Mobility Client. Users may append a different factor selection to their password entry.
Cisco Secure VPN (formerly AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client)
Cisco Secure VPN empowers remote workers with frictionless, highly secure access to the enterprise network from any device, at any time, in any location while protecting the organization. It provides a consistent user experience across devices, both on and off premises, without creating a headache for your IT teams. Simplify management with a single agent.
Note:       Strong encryption license is required in smart account

Cisco Umbrella Roaming Security Module
Cisco Umbrella Roaming Security module for Cisco Secure VPN provides always-on security on any network, anywhere, any time. The Roaming Security module enforces security through Umbrella’s Secure Internet Gateway (SIG). Cisco Umbrella SIG unifies multiple functions in a single solution that traditionally required a set of on-premises security appliances (firewalls, proxies, gateways) or single function cloud-based security solutions. Umbrella provides real-time visibility and control for all internet activity both on and off your network or VPN.

Cisco Firepower Threat Defense
The deployment steps in this design guide assume that the FTD devices are managed by FMC, have been deployed as a High Availability Pair and are accessible over the WAN network. For installation and deployment guides:
Firewall Management Center Virtual Getting Started Guide
Cisco Firepower 4100 Getting Started Guide
Cisco Firepower Split Tunneling Configuration
High Availability for Firepower Threat Defense
Note:       This design guide uses the Firepower 4110 for testing and validation. The version needed for your environment may change depending on access requirements. For performance information see the Cisco Firepower 4100 Series Data Sheet.
Once they have been installed, the interfaces, routing, NAT (Network Address Translation), and policy can be applied to the devices.
Interfaces
Typically, a minimum of two interfaces must be configured to have a system that passes meaningful traffic. Normally, you would have an outside interface that faces the upstream router or internet, and one or more inside interfaces for your organizations network(s). For this design guide, the outside interface is used as the ingress interface for VPN connections and the inside interface is used to denote the link to the rest of the network.
For more information on the configuration of Interfaces in Firewall Management Center go here.
Outside Interface
Step 1. Go to Devices -> Device Management in the FMC
Step 2. Click on the FTD or HA (High Availability) pair name
Step 3. Go to the Interfaces tab
Step 4. Edit the interface that is going to the outside using the pencil icon on the right side. In this case it is port-channel1.
Step 5. Give it a meaningful name. This guide uses outside.
Step 6. In the security zone section, open the dropdown and create a new zone
Step 7. Give it a meaningful name. This guide uses outside. Click OK. This will create a new zone.
Step 8. Verify that the new zone was created and is filled in on the dropdown
Step 9. Go to the IPv4 tab
Step 10.        Fill in the publicly addressable IP address for your company with a netmask of 255.255.255.254.
  Step 11.        Click OK. Verify the interface information is on the device interface page.
Step 12.        Click on Save on the top right to save this configuration
Inside Interface
Step 1. For the inside interface, repeat the same steps taken for the outside interface.
Step 2. Set the internal IP address to be the gateway for all the internal IPs.
Step 3. Click Ok, verify the information is in the interfaces tab and then save the configuration on the top right.
Routing
Cisco FTD supports several Internet protocols for routing:
●     Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)
●     Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
●     Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
●     Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
This design guide was validated using static routing, however, more details on setting up dynamic routing on Firewall Management Center can be found here.
Step 1. Go to Devices -> Device Management in the FMC
Step 2. Click on the FTD or HA pair name
Step 3. Go to the Routing tab then to the Static Route section
Step 4. Click on Add Route
Step 5. Select the outside interface, then create a new Available Network
Step 6. Give it a meaningful name, this guide will use internet, change the network radio button to Network, fill in 0.0.0.0/0 and Save
Step 7. Add the network that was created to the Selected Network section using the Add button
Step 8. Create a new gateway by pressing the plus (+) symbol
Step 9. Give it a meaningful name. This guide uses internetGw. Fill in the host box with the outside interfaces next hop and click Save
Step 10.        Verify the information is in the static route page and save the config on the top right of FMC
NAT
For this design guide, it is assumed that the Cisco FTD pair used for VPN access is also being used as the Internet Edge for the network. To facilitate this, NAT must be deployed for all internal traffic to reach the Internet. This will be used for application updates, on-site workers, FMC, and any other needs of different applications that may need the Internet.
Note:       If the Internet edge is located in another part of the network, skip this step, and create a route between the VPN firewall and the edge router(s).
For additional information on NAT go here.
Step 1. Go to Devices -> NAT
Step 2. Create a new policy using the Threat Defense NAT option
Step 3. Add a meaningful Name to the policy, Add the FTD device to the Selected Devices section, and click Save
Step 4. Edit the new NAT policy using the pencil icon and create a new rule on the right side
Step 5. Make the NAT rule a Manual NAT Rule with a Type Dynamic
Step 6. In the Translation tab, change the Original Source to any, Original Destination to Address and Translated Source to Destination Interface IP
Step 7. In the Interface Objects tab, add inside to Source Interface Objects and outside to the Destination Interface Objects, then Save
Step 8. Verify the rule is in the rule list and click Save on the top right
Policy
If you created a basic Block all traffic access control policy when you registered the FTD with the FMC, then you need to add rules to the policy to allow traffic through the device. If NAT was configured in the previous section, this procedure will show you how to create a rule that allows internal devices to communicate to the Internet, Policies to allow traffic from the VPN subnet to the internal network will be shown later in the document.
For more advanced security rules, see the Firewall Management Center Configuration Guide.
Step 1. Go to Policies -> Access Control
Step 2. Create a new policy on the right and give it a meaningful name. Add the FTD device to the selected devices and click Save.

Step 4. Add a meaningful Name to the policy, with the action Allow
Step 5. On the Networks tab, Add your internal address scheme to the Source Networks. Save the rule
Step 6. Verify there are two rules, a default deny and an allow for all internal traffic to get out. Save this policy
Deploy
Step 1. Go to Deploy -> Deployment
Step 2. Verify there is the FTD pending a deployment
Step 3. Select the FTD and deploy
Step 4. FTD initial setup is finished once it has successfully deployed
Cisco Secure Access by Duo
To install the authentication proxy, please follow the Cisco Firepower Threat Defense VPN with AnyConnect document.
Auth Proxy
The auth proxy config should look like this:
Directory Sync
So that we do not need to make a new user each time someone needs to login, we can make use of the Duo Directory Sync. This allows Duo to get the users and groups from the AD server using the authentication proxy. You can setup the Directory Sync using these directions.
Note:       Since the authentication proxy has already been installed, you can add a new cloud section to the configuration instead of installing a second authentication proxy.
The authentication proxy configuration file should now look like this:
