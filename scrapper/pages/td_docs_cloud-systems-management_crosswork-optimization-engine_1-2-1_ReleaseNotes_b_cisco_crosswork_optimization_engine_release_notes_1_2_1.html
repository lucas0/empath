Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine 1.2.1.x Release Notes
This document provides an overview of Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine, new features, and any limitations for this release.
Overview of Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine
Network operators are facing challenges to support the exponential growth of network traffic while addressing the pressure to efficiently run network operations. Providing quick service and network resolutions is vital for the business to remain viable. Network operators need a toolset to help automate bandwidth optimization and efficiently steer traffic with little operator intervention. Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine fulfills this need by providing real-time network optimization capabilities that allow operators to effectively maximize network utility as well as increase service velocity.
In a typical lifecycle, there is always a feedback loop that traditionally is done manually through human intervention. With network automation, the objective is to automate the feedback loop to enable quicker reaction to network events and faster determination on actions to perform on the network. Looking at the following figure, Crosswork Optimization Engine is built to fulfill the need for a closed-loop optimization loop as described under “Near Real-Time Feedback Loop”. Through Crosswork Optimization Engine, the operator would be able to define the optimization intent, implement the intent, and continuously monitor, track, and react to maintain the original intent.

Real-time Visibility
End-to-end visibility is important to any network operator to run their network effectively. Crosswork Optimization Engine not only provides this visibility, but also the ability to visualize the network across different layers (optical to IP) and the relationship between each layer. Crosswork Optimization Engine leverages IETF-standard BGP-LS protocol to discover IP network automatically, including the following features:
Real-time visibility: Provides the network operator with a true representation of the actual topology
Hierarchical topology view: Enables operators to define the different levels of granularity in the topology visualization
Simplified SR-TE Policy and RSVP-TE Tunnel Lifecycle Management
Crosswork Optimization Engine also provides an easy to use UI to manage the TE tunnel lifecycle. The UI enables the network operator to perform the following tasks:
Create, modify, and remove TE tunnels using an intuitive workflow
Continuously track TE tunnel dynamic path computations to maintain SLA objectives
Preview a TE tunnel before deploying it to the network
Extensibility through Function Packs
There are two function packs available for purchase: Bandwidth on Demand (BWoD) and Bandwidth Optimization (BWopt). For information on these function packs and instructions on how to use and enable them, see the Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine Function Packs document.

For the Crosswork Optimization Engine 1.2.1 version released on July 2020, the following patches must be installed sequentially to resolve CSCvtx24465 (A new interface field (IF Alias) has been added to the Link Details window to indicate circuit IDs for operational needs):
Crosswork_Patch_3.2.2_infra_1.2.1.1_COE_PATCH_signed.tar.gz
Crosswork_Patch_3.2.2_infra_1.2.1.2_COE_PATCH_signed.tar.gz
Crosswork_Patch_3.2.2_infra_1.2.1.3_COE_PATCH_signed.tar.gz
You must follow the steps and activate each patch as described in Crosswork Patch Framework. Confirm that each patch status message states Patch Activation successful before moving on to the next patch.
Note 
Log out of Crosswork Optimization Engine before applying patches. If you do not log out, UI changes will not appear unless you log out and back in again.
After installing the patch and rebooting the server, the Crosswork Network Automation version will revert back to the original version prior to installing the patch.
These patches can only be applied to the Crosswork Optimization Engine 1.2.1 version released on July 2020.
Crosswork Patch Framework
There are three types of patches in Crosswork Optimization Engine:
Crosswork Application Patching (PATCH_IMAGE): This is a patch on the Crosswork applications such as Crosswork Optimization Engine, and the configuration packages within the application layer. One or more applications can be patched simultaneously.
Crosswork Data Gateway Patching (PATCH_CDG): This is a patch on the collector images for Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway VM.
Crosswork Data Patching (PATCH_DATA): This is a patch to dynamically update the pre-built set of fundamental data such as YANG models and system MIB packages used by the Crosswork applications.
The patch versioning is done in the [MAJOR: MINOR: PATCH] format, where MAJOR corresponds to every major release of the Crosswork Optimization Engine, MINOR corresponds to every critical (backward incompatible) change made during a release, and PATCH corresponds to every patch created in a release.
The unit of a patch is a TAR file. The TAR file consists of the patch metadata, list of docker images, checksum and signature. The metadata contains platform and product details, patch version, type of patch and other creation details. Signature is a security requirement in order to safeguard the patch; the signature is verified by the patch framework. It also helps to perform error correction mechanisms and detect if the patch is corrupted or not.
The platform orchestrator (such as Robot orchestrator) maintains and manages the lifecycle of all applications in the Crosswork platform. Each Crosswork product has its own centralized manifest file <orchmanifest.json> which contains the list of applications and the corresponding configurations. When the orchestrator is up, it goes through the manifest. Along with the manifest, the dependency diagram <orch.yaml> explains the logical grouping of applications and their dependencies. Currently, simultaneous application patching is possible as the applications are independent of each other. Patching the Collection Infra is a system-wide change and requires shutting down other dependent applications. A patch on the Core Infra is not allowed and is considered as a VM upgrade. Schema changes are not allowed during patching. Users are recommended to take backup of the system before patching, to restore in case of any error.
Patching Activation Workflow:
Each stage of the patching workflow, performed using APIs, are explained below:
Validate
API: /crosswork/platform/v1/patch/validate
User downloads the patch to any reachable host from the Crosswork VM. After the download, the patch is validated for accuracy and compatibility to the product version.
Add
API: /crosswork/platform/v1/patch/add
After the patch is validated, it is added to the corresponding registry in the system, such as updating the IMAGE registry in case of an IMAGE patch. The add operation prepares the system for the patch to be activated. It is an asynchronous operation and may take around 15 mins. Once add is initiated, user receives a corresponding job ID and the operation is performed in the background.
Status
There are 2 status APIs:
Status - which displays the current status of the Patch framework.
API: /crosswork/platform/v1/patch/status
This API displays the current status of the patch framework, such as if add is successful or ongoing, or if activate has been triggered.
Job Status - which displays the specific job status.
API: /crosswork/platform/v1/patch/jobstatus
This API return the status of a specific job based on the Job ID.
Activate
API: /crosswork/platform/v1/patch/activate
After successful addition, the patching is locked. If a patch is added, it needs to be activated before another patch can be added to the application. Activate, like add, is an asynchronous operation that generates a job ID for the user and continues the process in the background. Activation takes the backup of the current state and updates the configuration. If the patch fails, the auto-roll back functionality rolls back to the previous version and the status is updated with the failure details.
Summary
API: /crosswork/platform/v1/patch/summary
Summary provides the overall summary of the Patch framework, and summary of the different patch types including patch version. This information changes each time a new patch is added and activated:
PATCH_IMAGE - Patch version and the applications changed as part of the patch.
PATCH_CDG - Patch version
PATCH_DATA - Patch version and the applications to which the new data has been uploaded.
Remove
API: /crosswork/platform/v1/patch/remove
A patch can be removed in 2 ways:
Flow 1: A patch can be removed after it is validated and added. For example, if user chooses to cancels after the add is successful, remove can be used.
Flow 2: A patch can be removed after it is validated, added and activated. For example, if user chooses to go back to a previous version after a patch is applied successfully, remove can be used.
For more information, refer the Swagger file for Payload in https://developer.cisco.com/docs/crosswork/#!platform.
Upon successful activation of a patch, user can verify the health of the application using the Crosswork Manager or Data Gateway Management feature in Crosswork Optimization Engine, depending on the type of the patch.
