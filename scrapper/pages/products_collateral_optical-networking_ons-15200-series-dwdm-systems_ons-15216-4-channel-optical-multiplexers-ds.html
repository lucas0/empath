Document history
    The Cisco ONS 15216 4 Channel Optical Add/Drop Multiplexers (OADMs) are a set of passive OADMs that allow the Cisco ONS 15454 Multiservice Transport Platform (MSTP) to address the edge of the optical network in a cost-effective manner without sacrificing operational ease of use. The Cisco ONS 15216 4 Channel OADMs are well suited to applications with minimal wavelength requirements and tight space and power constraints, such as cell site and customer premises terminations. Ten models are available, covering a 40-channel 100-GHz channel plan.

Applications
The Cisco ONS 15216 4 Channel OADM supports standard network topologies such as point-to-point and ring. With the introduction of omnidirectional and colorless Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer (ROADM) functionality on the Cisco ONS 15454 MSTP, the combined products allow additional network topologies, such as the termination of a spur or rings, originating on a Cisco ONS 15216 4 Channel OADM, into the colorless ports of the ROADM node (Figure 2). This configuration does not consume a ROADM degree, allowing the node to scale beyond eight directions of connectivity in a mesh-ROADM application.
Figure 2.            
OADM Nodes in a Spur Configuration Interconnecting with a Colorless Mesh ROADM Node
Another application for the Cisco ONS 15216 4-channel OADMs is as the add/drop stage of a single-module ROADM node. When only a small number of channels are required to add/drop at a ROADM node, using one or more 4-channel OADMs can save costs and space compared to the typical configuration using the Cisco ONS 15216 Mux/Demux 40 Channel Patch Panel. When the number of add/drop channels exceeds the deployed capacity of the OADMs, additional units can be added or replaced with a Cisco ONS 15216 Mux/Demux 40 Channel Patch Panel without affecting the service of existing pass-through channels.

400G transmission with Cisco ONS 15216 4-channel OADMs
There has been a recent update to the technical specification of the Cisco ONS 15216 4-channel OADMs. Cisco released new 400G capable digital pluggable optics, namely the QSFP-DD 400G ZR/ ZR+ and the 400G-CFP2-DCO. A much sought after customer application is to use this OADM filters with these new 400G optics. The QSFP-DD and CFP2-DCO pluggable optical modules will be hosted on Cisco platforms like the NCS1000 and the NCS2000. The signal from these modules are fed to this Cisco ONS 15216 4-channel OADMs. The OADMs could be set in a linear or ring topology with 400G circuits in a point-to-point or hub-spoke overlay atop this physical topology.
But the existing technical specification (specifically the operating wavelength bandwidth) of the Cisco ONS 15216 4-channel OADMs, did not allow the transmission of 400G signals. To meet this end, the specification of these Cisco ONS 15216 4-channel OADMs underwent a minor update to support the wideband required for 400G transmission. It is critical to note that, while the product itself has undergone a version-up for the improved specifications, the Cisco PID (product ID) for these OADM modules continue to be the same as before; as what’s mentioned in this datasheet below as well. Lastly, the newer versions of the OADM are also backward compatible to the older versions.

Update to the Cisco ONS 15216 4-Channel OADM specification
The OWB: Operating wavelength bandwidth, is the channel bandwidth centered on a 100 GHz-spaced ITU grid. The erstwhile OADMs had an OWB (of +/- 15 GHz) to support legacy applications alone. With the new version of the Cisco ONS 15216 4-Channel OADM, the following technical specification updates were done to facilitate the 400G transmission:
The OWB was extended (to that of +/- 26 GHz) to support 400G transmission.
The minimum bandwidth specification was increased.
The detailed specifications are mentioned in table 2, below.
Edge Mounting Bracket
A Cisco ONS 15216 4 Channel OADM occupies a single position in the Cisco ONS 15216 Edge Mounting Bracket. The mounting bracket occupies one Rack Unit (1RU) and mounts into a standard-19-inch rack. It has four positions for mounting OADMs.

Features and benefits
The Cisco ONS 15216 4 Channel OADM provides the following customer benefits:
●      Cost-effective DWDM add/drop capability
●      Best-in-class operational efficiency, with zero electrical power requirements
●      High port density: four OADMs can be mounted in a 1RU bracket
●      Low optical insertion loss for improved distance and performance
●      USB port for passive inventory management
●      Cisco Transport Controller (CTC) manageability for advanced fault isolation
●      CTP support for efficient network design verification
