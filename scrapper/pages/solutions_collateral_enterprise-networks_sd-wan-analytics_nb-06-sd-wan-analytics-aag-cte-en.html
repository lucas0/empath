    SD-WAN has evolved
Applications and users are more distributed than ever, and the internet has become the new enterprise WAN. As SD-WAN has transformed to connect users across multicloud, branch, data center, and a hybrid workforce, IT and network operations teams are constantly challenged to deliver reliable connectivity, application experience, and security over networks and services they don’t own or directly control.
In parallel, networks and devices generate a multitude of data points across thousands of sites, network paths, applications, and distributed users. It has become impossible to digest and make sense of this data. Time spent on the identification of issues and troubleshooting requires significant resources and further prolongs negative impacts on productivity.
To deliver transformation, IT leaders need a network analytics solution that provides visibility, predictivity, and automation to help them simplify network operations over such a dynamic environment.
Benefits of Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Analytics
●      Optimize efficiency: Correlate raw telemetry sources, establish historical benchmarks, and provide operational insights, thereby transforming network operations from a reactive to a highly predictive model.
●      Optimize resiliency: Monitor network and application performance proactively, while validating implemented policies with business requirements to avoid performance issues that could impact users.
●      Optimize user experience: Enable the unified application experience your end users have come to expect, regardless of their location and associated network environment.
●      Optimize operational sustainability: Establish a perpetual optimization cycle that achieves overall CapEx and OpEx efficiency. Predictive analytics improve network engineering that enables organizations to plan optimal capacity, thereby driving CapEx efficiency. OpEx efficiency is achieved by proactively preventing user-impacting issues, automating resolution, and reducing the overall troubleshooting cycles.
●      Optimize productivity: Create a proactive engagement model that allows IT to address network conditions that may otherwise have gone unnoticed. A proactive operating model will ultimately free up resources and time that can be shifted to higher-level strategic and innovation priorities.
●      Optimize operations: Deliver strategic business outcomes to enterprise and service providers. Workforce challenges in the IT sector are not new, with ongoing difficulties in finding the right talent to keep up with attrition and growth. Skill gaps grow greater each year as employers chase a smaller pool of highly skilled workers with expertise in cloud-native platforms, networking engineering, and security. Enhanced visibility, automation, and prediction can fill the gaps by standardizing operations and executing routine operational activities on a proactive basis.
Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Analytics
Cisco Catalyst™ SD-WAN Analytics simplifies network operations by providing granular network insights, predictivity, and automation that not only heighten network integrity but also deliver optimal application experience. By liberating IT and network teams from complex network operations, Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN empowers IT and network operation teams to maximize productivity and improve operational efficiency and resiliency, ultimately accelerating digital transformation and innovation.
Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Analytics consists of the following applications:
Cisco vAnalytics
Cisco vAnalytics aggregates a large volume of telemetry data and correlates application performance with underlying networks for operational insights in a highly visualized and simplified manner. vAnalytics enhances network visibility, establishes historical benchmarks, and expedites root-cause isolation, ultimately enabling enterprises to take the necessary corrective actions and have total control of the user experience.
Predictive Path Recommendations
Predictive Path Recommendations (PPR), powered by Cisco ThousandEyes® WAN Insights, an integral component of Cisco Predictive Networks, delivers a predictive network solution, enabling Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN customers to proactively improve the application experience for users. Leveraging advanced algorithms and predictive models, PPR determines the performance and policy compliance of the paths carrying the site application traffic. When performance is below historical benchmarks or service-level agreements, PPR can make recommendations and automatically implement corrective actions – before users are impacted. PPR is available today. The closed-loop automation feature is expected to be available in August 2023.
ThousandEyes
The integration of Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN and ThousandEyes brings end-to-end visibility into application delivery and network performance beyond the traditional enterprise network boundaries. This integration provides the only SD-WAN solution with turnkey ThousandEyes vantage points, delivering an optimal application experience over any network. Enterprises and other organizations can expedite the deployment of ThousandEyes agents through vManage integration to quickly pinpoint the source of issues, get to resolution faster, and manage the performance of what matters.
How do you deploy Cisco vAnalytics?
Cisco vAnalytics can be on-boarded alongside your new SD-WAN fabric from the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Self-Service Portal. For existing deployments, it can be activated from vManage. Please refer to the Cisco vAnalytics user guide for details.
