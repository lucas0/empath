Cisco Unity Express Guide to
Hardware Migration and Software Upgrades
Document First Published: January 18, 2011
Last Updated: June 20, 2011
Use this document, along with the Cisco Unity Express Compatibility Matrix, to determine your options for upgrading your Cisco Unity Express release version and, if necessary, migrating to a new Cisco Unity Express hardware platform.
Step 1 Verify the current Cisco Unity Express software version, hardware platform, and versions of the following Cisco call control products in your configuration:
•Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) with Cisco Survivable Remote Site Telephony (SRST)
or
•Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express (CUCME)
Table 1 lists the Cisco Unity Express releases, the hardware platforms supported, and the supported call control versions.
Step 2 Verify that the target release supports the hardware platform you are using.
•If the target release does not support your current hardware platform, then you are required to migrate to a new hardware platform. You will be required to back up your current configuration and restore it to the new hardware platform as part of the upgrade process.
If migrating to a new hardware platform, then the target platform must have the same or greater capacity as the current platform. See the Release Notes for Cisco Unity Express for information about system capacities.
•If the target release indicates that it's the last supported release for your platform, then you will be required to migrate to a new platform to upgrade to subsequent releases.
Step 3 Verify that the target release supports the call control version(s) that you are using.
•If the target release does not support the call control version you are using, then you are required to upgrade to a supported call control version.
Depending on your current configuration and the target release, you may need to perform your migration in multiple phases. You will need to determine whether to upgrade the Cisco Unity Express hardware and/or software first, or the call control software version first.
Step 4 Verify the license requirements for the target release.
Cisco Unity Express 7.1 and later versions require software activation using Cisco Software Licensing (CSL). If you are migrating from Cisco Unity Express 7.0 or an earlier release to Cisco Unity Express 7.1 or higher, then you must also migrate the license entitlements from the earlier release. For more information, see Software Activation for Cisco Unity Express 7.1 and Later Versions.

DISCLAIMER FOR RECORDING A CONVERSATION
The use of monitoring, recording, or listening devices to eavesdrop, monitor, retrieve, or record phone conversations or other sound activities, whether or not contemporaneous with transmission, may be illegal in certain circumstances under federal, state and/or local laws. Legal advice should be sought prior to implementing any practice that monitors or records any phone conversation. Some laws require some form of notification to all parties to a phone conversation, such as by using a beep tone or other notification method or requiring the consent of all parties to the phone conversation, prior to monitoring or recording the phone conversation. Some of these laws incorporate strict penalties. In cases where local laws require a periodic beep while a conversation is being recorded, the Cisco Unity Express voice-mail system provides a user with the option of activating "the beep." Prior to activating the Cisco Unity Express live record function, check the laws of all applicable jurisdictions. This is not legal advice and should not take the place of obtaining legal advice from a lawyer. IN ADDITION TO THE GENERAL DISCLAIMER THAT ACCOMPANIES THIS CISCO UNITY EXPRESS PRODUCT, CISCO ADDITIONALLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY, BOTH CIVIL AND CRIMINAL, AND ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE UNAUTHORIZED AND/OR ILLEGAL USE OF THIS CISCO UNITY EXPRESS PRODUCT. THIS DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT NECESSARILY LIMITED TO, THE UNAUTHORIZED AND/OR ILLEGAL RECORDING AND MONITORING OF TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS IN VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE FEDERAL, STATE AND/OR LOCAL LAWS.
