Cisco NCS 1001 Overview
Cisco NCS 1001 (NCS1001-K9) is 1 RU chassis that addresses the growing bandwidth needs of data center DWDM applications. It provides a DWDM line system that is optimized for data center environments and is optimized for point-to-point applications at maximum capacity. NCS 1001 supports up to three optical modules. The modules can be amplifiers or protection switching modules.
NCS 1001 has the following components:
Removable control card
Four removable fans
Two removable 600W AC/DC or DC/DC power supply modules (PSU)
Three slots for optical modules. Two Optical Amplifier Modules ( NCS1K-EDFA) and a Protection Switching Module (NCS1K-PSM) can be inserted in these slots.
The optical modules can be inserted in slots 1 to 3 as shown in the following figure. The optical modules can be inserted and removed from the slots while the system is operational. In amplified configuration, the Optical Amplifier module can be inserted in any slot. In (section) protected configuration, the protect Optical Amplifier module is inserted in slot 1, Protection Switching Module in slot 2, and working Optical Amplifier module in slot 3.

Caution
Each optical module must be inserted in a slot only when the module in the adjacent slot is completely inserted and seated or the adjacent slot is empty. If an optical module is inserted in a slot without seating the adjacent module, the ejector might interfere with the adjacent module.

Caution
The empty slots must be inserted with the filler optical modules or filler PSUs as appropriate to guarantee safety and system cooling compliance. See Cisco NCS 1001 Front View and Cisco NCS 1001 Rear View to identify the slots for optical modules and PSUs respectively.

Optical Amplifier Module
The optical amplifier module (NCS1K-EDFA) has pre-amplifier and booster amplifier.
The optical amplifier module provides the following functionality.
Preamplifier (LINE-RX to COM-TX) - Single preamplifier variant, with switchable gain ranges, according to link loss:
Range # 1: 0 to 24 dB gain, Tilt control: 24 to 27 gain, with tilt uncontrolled
Range # 2: 20 to 34 dB gain, Tilt control: 34 to 37 dB gain, with tilt uncontrolled
23dBm output power @ COM-TX port
Booster amplifier (COM-RX to LINE-TX) - True variable gain booster amplifier
Gain range: 1 to 20. 20 to 25 uncontrolled tilt.
23dBm output power @ LINE-TX port
ADD/DROP OSC channel supports both 1510nm and 1610nm +/-10nm
OCM assesses channel presence and Gain regulation and per channel power monitoring.

Protection Switching Module
The protection switching module (NCS1K-PSM) provides the following functionality.
In TX section:
Splits input optical channels to both working and protection lines.
Forces the switch in the remote site by opening one of the two line paths (by putting the related VOA in AVS).
In RX section:
Selects the signals from working or protection line. Each line is monitored through a PD.
Balances the two line losses by changing the VOA attenuation value at the same time of the switch change of state.

Optical Time Domain Reflectometer Module
Optical Time Domain Reflectometer (OTDR) is a line card supported in NCS 1001. The line card contains 2x bidirectional OTDRs and 2x filter that combines C-band, OSC, and OTDR filters and splits OSC and OTDR. Each internal OTDR can perform measurements on both TX and RX fiber by using an internal optical switch. OTDR line card is connected to the OSC port on the optical amplifier. The OTDR line card can be inserted in any slot of NCS 1001.

Description
Inventory Support
Cisco IOS XR Release 7.3.1
A new passive device with PID NCS1K-MD-64-C (NCS 1000 64 channels Odd Multiplexer or Demultiplexer Patch Panel-C-band) is supported.
There are passive units that are part of NCS 1001 hardware configuration. It is possible to have information about these passive units as soon as they are connected with a proper USB cable through one of the four available USB ports on the controller card of the box itself.
In this case their basic parameters are displayed in the output of “show inventory” command by XR or admin session.
The following passive modules are supported in NCS 1001:

ONS Coupler and Splitter
15216-FLD-OSC
OSC Combiner and Splitter
NCS1K-MD-64-C
NCS 1000 64 channels Odd Multiplexer/Demultiplexer Patch Panel-C-band
When the supported passive module is connected to the front panel port of NCS 1001, the module is discovered and the inventory data is read from the USB device. The user can view the details of passive module such as PID, Description, Serial Number, and Version ID using the show inventory command. Only one passive unit information can be retrieved in the inventory of the box , if it is connected to the box itself through a cable to one of the available four USB ports.
The same parameter plus others are also obtainable in the response to SNMP get on “entPhysicalEntity” objects
