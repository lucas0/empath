The 3000 Series are ideal switches for industrial Ethernet applications, including factory automation, intelligent transportation systems (ITS), and power utility substations.
Key Benefits
Rugged
Our switches are specifically designed for harsh environmental conditions. They exceed the specifications of most commercial switching products, including IEEE 1613 and IEC 61850 compliance.
Easy to use
The switches can be configured and managed at the touch of a button, using either an onboard GUI tool or the PC-based network assistant.
Highly secure
These switches help to ensure that only authorized users and traffic can access and traverse the network.
Standards based
The series helps to ensure that the system operates with other Ethernet-enabled devices and IP applications. It also facilitates integration between office applications and industrial equipment.
PROFINET Certification (PDF -800 KB)
Cisco IE 3000 switches now have PROFINET v2 certification with conformance class B compliance.
The IE 3000 series can be easily managed by Cisco Industrial Network Director, a network management system purpose built for industrial applications that uses the complete capabilities of the Cisco industrial Ethernet product family to make the network easily accessible to non-IT operations personnel.
