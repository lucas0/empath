Problem Description
The console is not accessible due to a dual in-line memory module (DIMM) displaced on the controller card (NCS1K-CNTLR=) in the NCS1002-K9 chassis.
Background
The NCS1K controller card has two standard DIMMs plugged into low profile DIMM connectors. There are a few instances reported of where the DIMM is displaced from the connector slot, which causes the console to be inaccessible when the chassis is powered on.
Problem Symptom
If one of the two DIMMs is out of slot then only the BIOS boots. The XR fails to boot due to insufficient memory.
If both the DIMMs are out of slot then the BIOS and XR will not boot. The result is that the console is not accessible.
Workaround/Solution
Remove and reinsert both the DIMMs on the controller card (NCS1K-CNTLR=) if the previously mentioned symptoms are observed.
A detailed procedure of how to remove and reinsert the DIMM on the controller card (NCS1K-CNTLR=) is shown in this section.
Caution: Follow the standard ESD rules when you replace DIMMs.
Procedure
Step 1: Remove the DIMMs - Push down the two connector-latches as depicted in this picture.
Step 2: Re-insert the DIMMs - Press on two points close to the far ends of the DIMM in order to push the DIMMs down into the connector as shown here.
Step 3: Verify correct insertion - The two connector-latches should be closed if the module has been correctly inserted as shown in this picture.
