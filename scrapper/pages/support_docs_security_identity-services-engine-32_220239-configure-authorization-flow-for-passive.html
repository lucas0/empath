Introduction
This document describes how to configure Authorization rules for Passive ID events to assign SGTs to the sessions.
Background Information
Passive identity services (Passive ID) do not authenticate users directly, but gather user identities and IP addresses from external authentication servers such as Active Directory (AD), known as providers, and then share that information with subscribers.
ISE 3.2 introduces a new feature that allows you to configure an authorization policy to assign a Security Group Tag (SGT) to a user based on the Active Directory group membership.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:
Cisco ISE 3.X
Passive ID integration with any provider
Active Directory (AD) administration
Segmentation (Trustsec)
PxGrid (Platform Exchange Grid)
Components Used
Identity Service Engine (ISE) software version 3.2
Microsoft Active directory
Syslogs
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Configuration
Step 1. Enable ISE Services.
On ISE, navigate to Administration > Deployment, choose the ISE node and click Edit, enable Policy Service and choose Enable Passive Identity Service. Optional, you can enable SXP and PxGrid if the passive id sessions need to be published through each one. Click Save.
Warning: SGT details of the PassiveID login users that are authenticated by API provider cannot be published into SXP. However, the SGT details of these users can be published through pxGrid and pxGrid Cloud.
Services Enabled
Step 2. Configure the Active Directory.
Navigate to Administration > Identity Management > External Identity Sources and choose Active directory then click the Add button.
Enter the Join Point Name and Active Directory Domain. Click Submit.
Add Active Directory
3. A pop up appears to join ISE to the AD. Click Yes. Enter the Username and Password. Click OK.
Continue to join ISE
  Join Active Directory
4. Retrieve AD groups. Navigate to Groups, click Add, then click Retrieve Groups and choose all the interested groups and click OK.

5. Enable Authorization flow. Navigate to Advance Settings and in the section PassiveID Settings check the Authorization Flow checkbox. Click Save.
Enable Authorization Flow
Step 3. Configure Syslog provider.
Navigate to Work Centers > PassiveID > Providers, choose Syslog Providers, click Add and complete the information. Click Save
Caution: In this case, ISE receives the syslog message from a successful VPN connection in an ASA, but this document does not describe that configuration.
Configure Syslog provider
Click Custom Header. Paste the sample syslog and use a Separator or Tab to find the device hostname. If it is correct, the Hostname appears. Click Save
Configure Custom Header
Step 4. Configure Authorization rules
Navigate to Policy > Policy Sets. For this case, it uses the Default policy. Click the Default policy. In the Authorization Policy, add a new rule. In the PassiveID policies, ISE has all the providers. You can combine this one with a PassiveID group. Choose Permit Access as Profile, and in Security Groups choose the need it SGT.
Configure Authorization Rules
Verify
Once ISE receives the Syslog, you can check the Radius Live Logs to see Authorization Flow. Navigate to Operations > Radius > Live logs.
In the logs you can see the Authorization event. This one contains the Username, Authorization Policy and Security Group Tag associated with it.
Radius Live Log
To check more details, click the Detail Report. Here you can see the Authorize-Only flow that evaluates the Policies to assign the SGT.

Troubleshoot
For this case, it uses two flows; the passiveID sessions and the Authoriation flow. To enable the debugs, navigate to Operations > Troubleshoot > Debug Wizard > Debug Log Configuration, then choose the ISE node.
For the PassiveID, enable the next components to DEBUG level:
PassiveID
To check the logs, based on the Passive ID provider, the file to check for this scenario, you need to review the file passiveid-syslog.log, for the other providers:
passiveid-agent.log
passiveid-api.log
passiveid-endpoint.log
passiveid-span.log
passiveid-wmilog
For the Authorization Flow, enable the next components to DEBUG level:
policy-engine
prrt-JNI
