aaa accounting
To enable authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) accounting of requested services for billing or security purposes when you use TACACS+, use the aaa accounting command in global configuration mode or template configuration mode. To disable AAA accounting, use the no form of this command.
aaa accounting { system | exec | network | connection | connection-name | commands level } [default] { start-stop | stop-only } group group-name
no aaa accounting { system | exec | connection | connection-name | commands level } [default] { start-stop | stop-only } group group-name
Syntax Description
system
Performs accounting for all system-level events not associated with users, such as reloads.
Note
  When system accounting is used and the accounting server is unreachable at system startup time, the system will not be accessible for approximately two minutes.
commands
connection
exec
Specifies the accounting method list. Enter at least one of the following keywords:
commands : Creates a method list to provide accounting information about specific, individual EXEC commands associated with a specific privilege level.
connection : Creates a method list to provide accounting information about all outbound connections made from the network access server.
exec : Creates a method list to provide accounting records about user EXEC terminal sessions on the network access server, including username, date, and start and stop times.
exec
Runs accounting for the EXEC shell session. This keyword might return user profile information such as what is generated by the autocommand command.
network
Runs accounting for all network-related service requests.
connection
Provides information about all outbound connections made from the network access server, such as Telnet, local-area transport (LAT), TN3270, packet assembler and disassembler (PAD), and rlogin.
commands level
Runs accounting for all commands at the specified privilege level. Valid privilege level entries are integers from 0 through 15.
start-stop
Sends a “start” accounting notice at the beginning of a process and a “stop” accounting notice at the end of a process. The “start” accounting record is sent in the background. The requested user process begins regardless of whether the “start” accounting notice was received by the accounting server.
stop-only
Sends a stop accounting record for all cases including authentication failures regardless of whether the aaa accounting send stop-record authentication failure command is configured.
group group-name
Server groups for aaa accounting with group-name as character string or radius or tacacs+ as defined by aaa group server command.
Command Default
AAA accounting is disabled.

Release Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco SD-WAN Manager CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
Use ip tacacs source-interface command to set the IP address of a subinterface for all outgoing TACACS+ packets. This address is used if the interface is in the up state. In this way, the TACACS+ server can use one IP address entry associated with the network access client instead of maintaining a list of all IP addresses. You can use the ip tacacs source-interface command when the router has many interfaces and ensure that all TACACS+ packets from a particular router have the same IP address. The specified interface must have an IP address associated with it. If the specified subinterface does not have an IP address or is in a down state, TACACS+ reverts to the default. To avoid this, add an IP address to the subinterface or bring the interface to the up state.
Example
The following example configures TACACS+ to use the IP address of the loopback0 interface for all outgoing TACACS+ packets.
Device(config)# ip tacacs source-interface loopback0
ip vrf forwarding (server-group)
To associate a Virtual Private Network (VPN) routing and forwarding (VRF) reference of an authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) TACACS+ server group, use the ip vrf forwarding command in server-group configuration mode. To enable server groups to use the global (default) routing table, use the no form of this command.
ip vrf forwarding vrf-name
