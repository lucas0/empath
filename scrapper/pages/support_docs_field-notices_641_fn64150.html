Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCuy39698 RFGW-10 DS384 Intermittent VoD Black Screen.
Problem Description
An intermittent VoD (Video on Demand) black screen is observed on the display device.
Line card is: RFGW-DS384  
The issue might be observed when all of these conditions are present:
RFGW-10 Cisco IOS Versions SQD01 and earlier
DS384 linecard that runs continuously (no restarts) for 206 days or more
New encrypted VoD sessions are started
In order to check if the system uptime is more than 206 days, enter the show version | i uptime command as shown here:
Background
The root cause is an issue in the DS384 Linecard Operating System. Refer to Cisco bug ID CSCuy39698 for the issue details.
Note: In order to access the Cisco bug ID link above and see detailed bug information, you must be a registered customer and you must be logged in.
Problem Symptom
An intermittent black screen on the display device might occur when encrypted VoD sessions are initiated. The error is indicated by the Powerkey/Conditional Access (CA) session being lost and established messages in the Supervisor card's log. Other symptoms include broken pipe events in the linecard log and unusual/negative TCP timer values in the netstat -P command run on the linecard.
This issue is identified by:
DS384 linecard logs:
*Apr 1 07:14:53.370 UTC: %RFGW-3-LINECARD_ERRMSG_ERR: SLOT 3:LC_ERRMSG_SCS_ALARM_SET EIS:PowerKEY: Connection with CA System lost
*Apr 1 07:15:08.371 UTC: %RFGW-3-LINECARD_ERRMSG_ERR: SLOT 3:LC_ERRMSG_SCS_ALARM_CLEAR EIS: PowerKEY: Connection with CA System Established
*Apr 1 07:15:28.388 UTC: %RFGW-3-LINECARD_ERRMSG_ERR: SLOT 3:LC_ERRMSG_SCS_ALARM_SET EIS: PowerKEY: Connection with CA System lost
When logged into the DS384 linecard, TCP timers show negative values.
# netstat -P 7f40e4b0

netstat: Server fault on msg pass

TCP Protocol Control Block at 0x7f40e4b0:
Timers: REXMT: -2147483532     PERSIST: 0     KEEP: -2146634050      2MSL: 0 
State: ESTABLISHED, flags 0x9e0, inpcb 0x7f40dc40, in6pcb 0x0
Note: The netstat -A CLI command lists active Internet connections and the netstat -P CLI command lists the PCB details.

Workaround/Solution
This issue has two workarounds and a solution - customers can choose the option that makes the most sense for their situation.
Workarounds
Scenario 1: DS384 linecard redundancy is in place
Switch the working linecard to the protect card
Then, revert back
Ensure the protect linecard has not run continuously for almost 206 days. If so, reset the protect linecard and ensure the protect linecard status is in Standby and does not protect the other linecard.
Scenario 2: No DS384 linecard redundancy
Restart the linecard with the cable linecard reset CLI command.
If linecard redundancy is not configured and multiple/all linecards are affected or approach the trigger uptime of 206 days, then it might be more efficient to restart the chassis than each individual linecard.
Solution
This issue is fixed in Cisco IOS-XE Releases 3.5.2SQ (SQD02) and later. Hence, an alternative to the workaround is to upgrade to Cisco IOS-XE Release 3.5.2SQ (SQD02) or later.
