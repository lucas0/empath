GRE Over IPsec Tunnels Between Cisco IOS XE Devices
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1
This feature allows you to set up GRE over IPsec tunnels with IKEv2 RSA-SIG authentication on Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices in the controller mode to connect to Cisco IOS XE devices in the autonomous mode. This set up enables Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices to use OSPFv3 as the dynamic routing protocol and multicast traffic across the WAN network.
You can configure GRE over IPsec tunnels using the CLI device templates in Cisco SD-WAN Manager for Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices.

Prerequisites for GRE Over IPsec Tunnels Between Cisco IOS XE Devices
To configure GRE over IPsec tunnels, use Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) protocol, and RSA Signature as the authentication method.
Restrictions for GRE Over IPsec Tunnels Between Cisco IOS XE Devices
IPv6 addresses for IPsec tunnel source are not supported.
You cannot configure GRE Over IPsec tunnels between Cisco IOS XE devices using Cisco SD-WAN Manager GUI.
Information About GRE Over IPsec Tunnels Between Cisco IOS XE Devices
You can configure Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) over an Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) tunnels on Cisco IOS XE devices. GRE supports multicast and dynamic routing protocol, IPsec with IKEv2 protocol offers the enhanced security. GRE over IPsec tunnels are configured using the OSPFv3(dynamic routing protocol) and multicast(in sparse-mode), using the IPsec to encrypt the packets across the tunnels, and using the IKEv2 along with RSA-SIG authentication to perform authentication, establish and maintain security associations.
Benefits of GRE Over IPsec Tunnels Between Cisco IOS XE Devices
Enables migration. You can either migrate to a Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN network or modify a device to support Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN.
Provides a full mesh connection between a branch and data center, irrespective of whether the network is a Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN network or a non-SD-WAN network.
Supports OSPFv3 and multicast traffic from a Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN enabled branch to a non-SD-WAN data center.
Use Case for GRE Over IPsec Tunnels Between Cisco IOS XE Devices
In this sample topology, there are Cisco IOS XE devices that are located in different data centers and branches. Two Cisco IOS XE devices in the controller mode are located in the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN network, one in a data center and another in a branch. The other two Cisco IOS XE devices in the autonomous mode are located in a non-SD-WAN network. A GRE over IPsec tunnel is configured to connect the Cisco IOS XE devices from the branch on the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN network to the data center located in the non-SD-WAN network.

Note
Ensure that the tunnel source is configured with the global VPN for the WAN side and the tunnel VRF configured with the service VPN for the Service side.
Configure GRE Over IPsec Tunnels Between Cisco IOS XE Devices
Configuring GRE over IPsec tunnels using Cisco SD-WAN Manager is a two-step process:
Install Certification Authentication.
Import the pkcs12 file on the Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device using the pki import command. For information, see the Install Certification Authentication section in Configure GRE Over IPsec Tunnels Between Cisco IOS XE Devices Using the CLI .
Prepare the GRE over IPsec tunnel configurations (GRE, IPsec, IKEv2, PKI, OSPFv3 and Multicast) via the Cisco SD-WAN Manager CLI Template, and push it to the Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device. For information about using a device template, see Device Configuration-Based CLI Templates for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices.
See the Configure GRE Over IPsec Tunnel section in Configure GRE Over IPsec Tunnels Between Cisco IOS XE Devices Using the CLI for a sample configuration for use in the CLI template.

Note
Note: Add the crypto pki trustpoint configuration command explicitly in the Cisco SD-WAN Manager CLI template.
Configure GRE Over IPsec Tunnels Between Cisco IOS XE Devices Using the CLI
This section provides example CLI configurations to configure GRE over IPsec tunnels for Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices in the controller mode.
Install Certification Authentication
Import the pkcs12 file on the Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device using the pki import command.
Device# crypto pki import trustpoint_name pkcs12 bootflash:certificate_name password cisco  
Execute the crypto pki trustpoint command to reconfigure the Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device.
 Device(config)# crypto pki trustpoint trustpoint_name 
 Device(ca-trustpoint)# enrollment pkcs12 
 Device(ca-trustpoint)# revocation-check none 
 Device(ca-trustpoint)# rsakeypair trustpoint_name

Note
The configurations for GRE over IPsec tunnels for Cisco IOS XE devices in the autonomous mode are the same as in the controller mode shown above.
Furthermore, the steps to install certification authentication for Cisco IOS XE devices in the autonomous mode is the same as in Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices, and there is no requirement for you to reconfigure crypto pki trustpoint explicitly on the Cisco IOS XE devices in the autonomous mode.

Example 1
The following is sample output from the show crypto pki certificates command using the optional trustpoint-name argument and verbose keyword. The output shows the certificate of a device and the certificate of the CA. In this example, general-purpose RSA key pairs are previously generated, and a certificate is requested and received for the key pair.
