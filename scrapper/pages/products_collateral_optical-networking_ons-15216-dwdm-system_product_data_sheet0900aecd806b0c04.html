Product Overview
As metropolitan (metro) transport networks grow from 2.5-generation (2.5G) services to 10G and eventually 40G, the underlying optical systems need to compensate for the lower chromatic dispersion tolerances on the 10G and 40G interfaces. In optical networks, the dispersion compensation unit (DCU) compensates for accumulated chromatic dispersion effect in fiber. It provides a flexible solution for accumulated chromatic dispersion without dropping and regenerating the wavelengths on the link, a process that would otherwise be necessary when accumulated chromatic dispersion exceeds the maximum allowed dispersion tolerance. To provide effective compensation, the DCU is designed to operate over the entire band from 1525 to1565 nm.
Features and Benefits
The Cisco ONS 15216 Dispersion Compensator Shelf (Figure 1) is a passive mechanical housing that is 1 rack unit (1RU) high and fits in a 19- or 23-inch rack or bay.

The Cisco ONS 15216 Dispersion Compensator Modules (Figure 2) can be installed in the dispersion compensator shelf in the following configurations:
• The first slot in the shelf is used for east-to-west traffic and the other slot for west-to-east traffic (Figure 3).
• The first slot in the shelf is used for west-to-east traffic and the other slot for east-to-west traffic (Figure 3).
• Both slots can be cascaded together east-to-west (the output of the first module in the first slot is connected to the input of the second module in the second slot). This configuration provides higher chromatic dispersion compensation than an individual module can provide (Figure 4).
• Both slots can be cascaded together from west to east (the output of the first module in the first slot is connected to the input of the second module in the second slot). This configuration provides higher chromatic dispersion compensation than an individual module can provide (Figure 4).
