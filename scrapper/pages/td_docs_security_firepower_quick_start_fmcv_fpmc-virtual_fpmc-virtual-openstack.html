About the Management Center Virtual Deployment on OpenStack
This guide describes how to deploy the management center virtual in an OpenStack environment. OpenStack is a free open standard cloud computing platform, mostly deployed as infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) in both public and private clouds where virtual servers and other resources are made available to users.
The management center virtual runs the same software as physical management center to deliver proven security functionality in a virtual form factor. The management center virtual can be deployed on OpenStack. It can then be configured to manage virtual and physical devices.
This deployment uses a KVM hypervisor to manage virtual resources. KVM is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions (such as Intel VT). It consists of a loadable kernel module, kvm.ko, that provides the core virtualization infrastructure and a processor specific module, such as kvm-intel.ko. You can run multiple virtual machines running unmodified OS images using KVM. Each virtual machine has private virtualized hardware: a network card, disk, graphics adapter, and so forth.
Because the devices are already supported on the KVM hypervisor, no additional kernel packages or drivers are needed to enable OpenStack support.
Prerequisites for the Management Center Virtual and OpenStack
Download the management center virtual qcow2 file from software.cisco.com and put it on your Linux host:

Deploy the Management Center Virtual on Openstack
Cisco provides sample heat templates for deploying the management center virtual. Steps for creating the OpenStack infrastructure resources are combined in a heat template (deploy_os_infra.yaml) file to create networks, subnets, and router interfaces. At a high-level, the management center virtual deployment steps are categorized into the following sections.
Upload the management center virtual qcow2 image to the OpenStack Glance service.
Create the network infrastructure.
Network
Subnet
Router interface
Create the management center virtual instance.
Flavor
Security Groups
Floating IP
Instance
You can deploy the management center virtual on OpenStack using the following steps.
Upload the Management Center Virtual Image to OpenStack
Create the Network Infrastructure for the OpenStack and the Management Center Virtual
Create the Management Center Virtual Instance on OpenStack
Upload the Management Center Virtual Image to OpenStack
Copy the management center virtual qcow2 image to the OpenStack controller node, and then upload the image to the OpenStack Glance service.
Before you begin
Download the management center virtual qcow2 file from Cisco.com and put it on your Linux host:
https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html
Procedure
Step 1
Copy the qcow2 image file to the OpenStack controller node.
Step 2
Upload the management center virtual image to the OpenStack Glance service.
root@ucs-os-controller:$ openstack image create <fmcv_image> --public --disk-
format qcow2 --container-format bare --file ./<fmcv_qcow2_file>
Step 3
Verify if the management center virtual image upload is successful.
root@ucs-os-controller:$ openstack image list
Example:
root@ucs-os-controller:$ openstack image list+--------------------------------------+-------------------+--------+
| ID                                   | Name              | Status |+--------------------------------------+-------------------+--------+
| b957b5f9-ed1b-4975-b226-4cddf5887991 | fmcv-7-0-image | active |+--------------------------------------+-------------------+--------+
The uploaded image and its status is displayed.
What to do next
Create the network infrastructure using the deploy_os_infra.yaml template.
Create the Network Infrastructure for the OpenStack and the Management Center Virtual
Deploy the OpenStack infrastructure heat template to create the network infrastructure.
Before you begin
Heat template files are required to create the network infrastructure and the required components for the management center virtual, such as flavor, networks, subnets, router interfaces, and security group rules:
env.yaml ― Defines the resources created to support the management center virtual on the compute node, such as the image name, interfaces, and IP addresses.
deploy_os_infra.yaml ― Defines the environment for the management center virtual, such as the network and subnets.
Templates for your management center virtual version are available from the GitHub repository at FMCv OpenStack heat template.

Important
Note that Cisco-provided templates are provided as open source examples, and are not covered within the regular Cisco TAC support scope. Check GitHub regularly for updates and ReadMe instructions.
Procedure
Step 1
Deploy the infrastructure heat template file.
root@ucs-os-controller:$ openstack stack create <stack-name> -e <environment files name> -t <deployment file name>
Example:
root@ucs-os-controller:$ openstack stack create infra-stack -e env.yaml -t deploy_os_infra.yaml
Step 2
Verify if the infrastructure stack is created successfully.
root@ucs-os-controller:$ openstackstack list
Example:
root@ucs-os-controller:$ openstack stack list
