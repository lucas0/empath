Introduction
This article describes the process of validating license ownership by product activation key (PAK) enhanced authentication.
Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure that you have the following data at your disposal:
Active Cisco.com account
Product activation key (PAK)
Validating License Ownership by PAK Enhanced Authentication
Validating license ownership is a one time requirement per product activation key (PAK) per user. It is a small step incorporated in the License Registration Portal (LRP) that the system prompts you to complete when you are getting licenses from a new product activation key (PAK), from a selected product activation key (PAK); or adding a new product activation key (PAK) or token; or assigning a product activation key (PAK) to Smart account, converting a product activation key (PAK) to Smart licensing, or getting product activation key (PAK) or token information.
Note: If a Smart account is specified at the time of creating the order, the system does not prompt you to validate license ownership since the product activation key (PAK) is securely pre-assigned to your Smart account.
To validate license ownership, the system may ask you to provide the following security identifiers:
Personal identification number (PIN)
Sales order number, line number, ship set
Claim certificate in PDF format
You can locate the security identifiers in the following ways:
If you have a claim certificate at your disposal, then you can locate the PIN, sales order number, line number, and ship set.
Note: If you purchase a physical device, you receive a paper copy of the claim certificate for the related license in the box with the physical device. If you deploy a virtual device, you receive the claim certificate for the related license as an email attachment. If you buy feature license for either physical or virtual devices, you receive the claim certificate as an email attachment. You can also download the claim certificate from My Cisco Entitlements (MCE).
If you cannot find the claim certificate, refer to your CiscoeDelivery Order Notification email in which you can click the Get License (PAK) button to initiate your product activation key (PAK) registration in License Registration Portal (LRP). No PIN is required.
Note: If you are not ready to register your license at this point in time, click the Access Order button in the Cisco eDelivery Order Notification email to download the claim certificate from My Cisco Entitlements (MCE).
If you cannot find your claim certificate, and you ordered the license with eDelivery method, then you can download the claim certificate in the following way: 
Log in to My Cisco Entitlements (MCE) with a valid Cisco.com account.
On the Orders tab, select to view orders either by the Account View or User View. Enter the sales order number in the search bar, and then press Enter or click the magnifying glass icon.

Click the order that the system displays in the search results.
Step result: The system displays the Order Details page.
On the Order Details page, on the Order Line(s) tab, expand the circled plus icon next to the product number.
Step result: The system expands the entire configuration and displays software, documents, and licenses associated to the main line.

In the File Type column, find License (CLAIM), and then click the shopping cart icon.
Step result: The system adds the claim certificate to your shopping cart.

Click the shopping cart icon to view the items inside.
Step result: The system displays the Your Cart page.
On the Your Cart page, select the Accept License Agreements radio button, and then click the download icon to download the claim certificate.
Step result: The system displays a notification message that informs you about initiating the download. Once the system completes the download and the file is saved on your computer, the system removes the License (CLAIM) item from your shopping cart.

If you purchased your licenses through a Partner and you do not have your claim certificate, or the Cisco eDelivery Order Notification email, contact your Partner. Partners and direct customers can generate the Cisco eDelivery Order Notification to one or more email addresses in My Cisco Entitlements (MCE) in the following way:
Log in to My Cisco Entitlements (MCE) with a valid Cisco.com account.
On the Orders tab, from the Smart Account and Virtual Account drop-down lists, select the respective accounts. Click to view orders either by the Account View or User View, and then enter the sales order number in the search bar. Press Enter or click the magnifying glass icon.

Click the Actions icon, and then select Send Order Access from the drop-down list.

On the Send Order Based Access page, enter the email address in the Email field, and then click Send Order Access.
In the Confirmation dialog box, click OK.
Step result: The system automatically sends a Cisco Order Delivery Notification to the email address that you specified in the Email field.
Note: The Cisco Order Delivery Notification email contains the Access Order link that enables you to obtain access to the order in My Cisco Entitlements (MCE).
