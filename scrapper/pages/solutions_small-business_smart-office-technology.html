“Cisco Meraki and Webex have given us the reliable and cost-effective communication tools that we need to react in a crisis. We are doing more, spending less money, and using fewer resources to manage our infrastructure. I can easily set up, maintain, and troubleshoot our infrastructure.”

"The Cisco and the Meraki tech stack was so easy to set up and install devices and there was a lot of out-of-the-box functionality, including management and monitoring. They use a simple licensing model and it's very easy to calculate the cost for a switch or expansion."

Michael Jörgensen, IT chief / CTO at Abdon Food
