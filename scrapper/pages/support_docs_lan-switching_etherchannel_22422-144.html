Introduction
This document provides sample configurations on IEEE 802.1Q/Inter-Switch Link (ISL) trunking and Layer 2 (L2) EtherChannel between Cisco Catalyst 2900 XL/3500 XL or Catalyst 2950 series switches and a Catalyst 6500/6000 switch that runs Cisco IOSÂ® Software. You can also use a Catalyst 4500/4000 switch that runs Cisco IOS Software instead of the Catalyst 6500/6000 for this example. This document discusses the most important factors to consider when you configure trunking and channeling between the switches. The document also includes configuration examples.
In this document, four Fast Ethernet ports from each of the switches have been trunked and bundled into Fast EtherChannels (FECs). Trunking protocol was used for the 3500 XL ISL, and 802.1Q was used for the 2950 example.
Note: The Catalyst 2950 does not support ISL trunking. Use 802.1Q trunking instead.
Prerequisites
Requirements
There are no specific requirements for this document.
Components Used
In order to create the examples in this document, these switches were used in a lab environment, with cleared configurations:
Catalyst 3548 XL switch that runs Cisco IOS Software Release 12.0(5)WC2
Catalyst 2950-24 switch that runs Cisco IOS Software Release 12.1(6)EA2c
Catalyst 6509 switch with Supervisor Engine II that runs Cisco IOS Software Release 12.1(11b)E
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Conventions

DTP
Trunks between devices may be configured statically or with the use of Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP). DTP allows both devices connected to negotiate the trunk settings before actually forming the trunk connection. Configurable Cisco IOS Software switch port (trunking) modes include: dynamic (the port negotiates either access or trunk mode), trunk (unconditionally sets the port to trunking), and access (non-trunk access port). The most commonly used mode combination settings on two sides of a static (non-DTP negotiated) trunk are trunk-trunk. For dynamic (DTP-negotiated) trunks, the usual settings are dynamic-dynamic. Other combinations may produce valid results but are outside the scope of this document. A trunk connection between a Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP)-capable switch and a non-PagP device requires the trunk mode to be on.
Note: Most Cisco routers and some Catalyst switches do not support DTP and require static trunking configuration. For example, Catalyst XL series, Catalyst 2948G-L3, Catalyst 4908G-L3, Catalyst 8500 series, 2/3/4/7xxx series Cisco routers, and so on do not support DTP and require static trunking configuration.
802.1Q Native VLAN Consideration
802.1Q trunking inserts a 4-byte 802.1Q tag field into frames sent over the trunk, which contain VLAN information. The 802.1Q tag is inserted into each frame transferred over the trunk except for frames transmitted on the native VLAN, which are sent untagged. In most cases, the native VLAN has to match on both sides of the trunk unless there is a specific unusual configuration requirement, which is outside the scope of this document. If the native VLANs do not match, the switch logs Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) messages stating the mismatch. While not catastrophic, this setup effectively causes the two different native VLANs to be merged into one larger L2 broadcast domain (VLAN). These two VLANs attempt to calculate one common Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) topology for such bridged native VLANs, with the risk of eventually exceeding the maximum supported STP diameter.
Note: There is a special case when a neighbor or third-party device requires all VLANs to be tagged. If this occurs, you may implement a workaround to create a dummy VLAN and set it up as native VLAN. This will tag all other necessary VLANs, and they will pass traffic over the trunk to the neighbor or third-party device. In Cisco IOS Software Release 12.1.11bEX, 12.1.13E, and later, the Catalyst 6500 that runs Cisco IOS Software supports the 802.1Q trunking option that will tag all VLAN traffic including native VLAN. Issue the vlan dot1q tag native command under global configuration mode. On the Catalyst 4500/4000 that runs Cisco IOS Software, the vlan dot1q tag native command was first introduced in Cisco IOS Software Release 12.2(18)EW.
PAgP
Gigabit EtherChannels (GECs) and FECs between switches can also be configured statically or dynamically with the use of PAgP. PAgP allows both devices connected to negotiate the settings before actually forming the channel. PAgP channel modes include: desirable (the port actively initiates channel negotiation), auto (default, in which the port does not initiate negotiation but responds to negotiation attempts started by the other side), and on (unconditionally sets the port to channel and does not exchange PAgP frames). A connection between a PAgP-capable switch and a non-PAgP device requires the on mode to form a channel.
The most commonly used mode combination on two sides of a static (non-PAgP negotiated) channel is on-on. For dynamic (PAgP-negotiated) channels, the usual settings are either desirable-desirable or desirable-auto. The connected ports configured for desirable mode perform channel negotiation and verification before starting the channeling and also keep verifying the channel when it is in operation. Due to the added protection offered by PAgP, this is usually the recommended setup if both connected switches support PAgP.
Note: PAgP has some deliberate configuration limitations. The ports to negotiate a channel must have the same speed, duplex, trunking encapsulation, and VLAN set. Also, the channel load balancing algorithm across links may be configurable on certain platforms.
Note: An EtherChannel is considered to be one unique STP port as soon as it is up. Therefore, to avoid STP inconsistencies when setting up a non-negotiated channel, proceed as follows:
Shut down all ports of the channel to configure on both sides.
Perform the configuration on both ends.
Reenable all ports.
Attempting to configure such a channel while the ports are up may result in temporary STP inconsistencies and/or loops. The steps only apply if PAgP is not used.
Catalyst 2900 XL/3500 XL
Catalyst 2900 XL/ 3500 XL series switches do not support DTP and PAgP, and therefore require static trunk and channel setup. Refer to the note above for more information. Catalyst 2900 XL/ 3500 XL series switches currently support both ISL and 802.1Q trunking encapsulations. For more information, refer to this document:
Configuring InterVLAN Routing and ISL/802.1Q Trunking on a Catalyst 2900XL/3500XL/2950 Switch Using An External Router
ISL is supported in Cisco IOS Software Release 11.2(8)SA4 and later, and 802.1Q is supported in Cisco IOS Software Release 11.2(8)SA5 and later.
With a Catalyst 2900 XL that runs Cisco IOS Software Release 11.2(8)SA1 or 11.2(8)SA2, you are allowed four EtherChannels (port groups) per switch with an unlimited number of ports per group. Load balancing across the links in the channel is always destination address-based. Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN) and port security features are not supported.
On a Catalyst 2900 XL that runs Cisco IOS Software Release 11.2(8)SA3 or later, a Catalyst 3500 XL that runs Cisco IOS Software Release 11.2(8)SA6 or later, and a Catalyst 2950, load balancing across the links in the channel is configurable to be based on the source or destination MAC address. Source is the default. Source-based forwarding allows up to eight ports in a FEC (port group). Destination-based forwarding allows unlimited ports per port group. You can configure up to 12 port groups per switch and can have a mix of source-/destination-based groups. SPAN and port security are not supported.
Catalyst 2950
Catalyst 2950 switches only support 802.1Q trunking and do not support ISL trunking. Catalyst 2950 switches support DTP and PAgP dynamic trunking and channel negotiation with Cisco IOS Software Release 12.1 releases and static modes only with Cisco IOS Software Release 12.0 releases. EtherChannel load balancing can use either source-MAC or destination-MAC address forwarding. You can configure the load balancing method by issuing the port-channel load-balance global configuration command. These switches support up to eight switch ports per channel.
Catalyst 6500 That Runs Cisco IOS Software
Catalyst 6500 switches that run Cisco IOS Software support L2 (switchport) and Layer 3 (L3) (routed port) EtherChannel configurations. A Catalyst 6500/6000 series switch supports a maximum of 64 EtherChannels (256 with Cisco IOS Software Release 12.1(2)E and earlier). You can form an EtherChannel with up to eight compatibly configured LAN ports on any module in a Catalyst 6000 series switch, with the exception of Digital Feature Card (DFC)-equipped modules (such as WS-X6816 and so on) which currently allow an L2 channel only using ports on the same DFC module. However, an L3 channel can be configured across different DFC-equipped modules. This limitation has been removed in Catalyst 6500/6000 Cisco IOS Software Release 12.1(11b)EX and later. This document configures an L2 EtherChannel.
The Catalyst 6500/6000 that runs Cisco IOS Software allows you to configure EtherChannel load balancing to use MAC addresses, IP addresses, or Layer 4 (L4) port information in any source, destination, and source-destination combination by issuing the port-channel load-balance global configuration command. The default is to use a hash function between source and destination IP addresses.
Catalyst 6500/6000 switches support both ISL and 802.1Q trunking encapsulations and DTP. Detailed information on port capabilities is available by issuing the show interface interface_id capabilities command.
Catalyst 4000 That Runs Cisco IOS Software
Catalyst 4000 switches that run Cisco IOS Software (with Supervisor Engine III and IV) support L2 (switchport) and L3 (routed port) EtherChannel configurations. A Catalyst 4000 series switch supports a maximum of 64 EtherChannels. You can form an EtherChannel with up to eight compatibly configured Ethernet interfaces on any module, and across modules in a Catalyst 4000 series switch. All interfaces in each EtherChannel must be the same speed and must all be configured as either L2 or L3 interfaces.
The Catalyst 4000 that runs Cisco IOS Software allows you to configure EtherChannel load balancing to use MAC addresses, IP address, or L4 port information in any source, destination, and source-destination combination by issuing the port-channel load-balance global configuration command. The default is to use a hash function between source and destination IP addresses.
The Catalyst 4000 that runs Cisco IOS Software supports ISL and 802.1Q trunking encapsulations and DTP. ISL is not available on certain modules. For a complete list of such modules, refer to the Understanding VLAN Trunks section of Configuring Layer 2 Ethernet Interfaces. In a future software release, detailed information on port capabilities will be available by issuing the show interface capabilities command. Currently this command is not available.

Troubleshoot
Use this section to troubleshoot your configuration.
Traffic Is Not Passing on an 802.1Q Trunk
One of these causes can result in the issue:
There is a native VLAN configuration mismatch on the ports that are connected between two switches.
Verify the native VLAN configuration on both the switches. Issue the show trunk command on the CatOS switch in order to see the native VLAN setting. Issue the show interface interface_id switchport command on the XL switch in order to see the native VLAN setting. If there is a native VLAN mismatch between the two switches, configure the switches with the same native VLAN. Issue the switchport trunk native vlan interface configuration command in order to change the native VLAN on the XL switch. Issue the set vlan command in order to change the native VLAN on the CatOS switch.
DTP frames are not supported in XL switches.
The CatOS switches send DTP frames over the trunk link, but the XL switches do not support DTP frames. DTP is not supported in XL switches. In order to avoid this problem, set the CatOS switch port status to no negotiate. Issue the set trunk mod/port nonegotiate dot1q command in order to set the trunk mode to nonegotiate for the dot1q trunking mode.
There is an encapsulation mismatch on the XL switch.
On the XL switch, verify that the trunk encapsulation is set to dot1q. Issue the show interface interface_id switchport command in order to see the current setting. Issue the switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q interface configuration command in order to change the encapsulation to dot1q.
An early version of CatOS does not support dot1q trunking.
The early version of CatOS that was used in the switches does not support dot1q trunking. Upgrade the CatOS of the switch to a later version that supports both the dot1q trunk and ISL trunk.
