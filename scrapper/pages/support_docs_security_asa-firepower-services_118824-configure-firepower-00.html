Introduction
The ASA FirePOWER module, also known as ASA SFR, supplies next-generation firewall services, including Next-Generation IPS (NGIPS), Application Visibility and Control (AVC), URL filtering, and Advance Malware Protection (AMP). You can use the module in single or multiple context mode, and in routed or transparent mode. This document describes the prerequisites and installation processes of a FirePOWER (SFR) module on ASA 5585-X hardware module. It also provides the steps to register an SFR module with FireSIGHT Management Center.
Note: The FirePOWER (SFR) Services reside on a hardware module in the ASA 5585-X, whereas, the FirePOWER services on the ASA 5512-X through 5555-X Series appliances are installed on a software module, resulting differences in installation processes.
Prerequisites
Requirements
The instructions on this document require access to the privileged EXEC mode. In order to access the privileged EXEC mode, enter the enable command. If a password was not set, just hit Enter.

In order to install FirePOWER Services on an ASA, the following components are necessary:
ASA software Version 9.2.2 or greater
ASA 5585-X platform
A TFTP server reachable by the management interface of FirePOWER module
FireSIGHT Management Center with Version 5.3.1 or greater
Note: The information in this document is created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Configuration
Before You Begin
Given an ASA SSM always occupies one of the two slots in the ASA 5585-X chassis, if you have a hardware module other than the FirePOWER (SFR) Services SSP such as the SSP-CX (Context Aware) or AIP-SSM (Advanced Inspection and Prevention Security), the other module must be uninstalled to make space for the SSP-SFR. Before you remove a hardware module, run the following command to shutdown a module:
ciscoasa# hw-module module 1 shutdown
Cabling and Management
You cannot access the SFR module's serial port via the ASA's console on the ASA 5585-X.
Once the SFR module is provisioned, you can session into the blade using the "session 1" command.
In order to completely reimage the SFR module on an ASA 5585-X, you must use the management Ethernet interface and a console session on the serial management port, which are on the SFR module and separate from the ASA's management interface and console.
Tip: In order to find the status of a module on the ASA, run the "show module 1 details" command which retrieves the SFR module's management IP and associated Defense Center.
Install FirePOWER (SFR) Module on ASA
1. Download the ASA FirePOWER SFR module initial bootstrap image from Cisco.com to a TFTP server accessible from ASA FirePOWER management interface. The image name looks like "asasfr-boot-5.3.1-152.img"
2. Download the ASA FirePOWER system software from Cisco.com to an HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP server accessible from the ASA FirePOWER management interface.

3. Restart the SFR Module
Option 1: If you do not have the password to the SFR Module, you can issue the following command from the ASA to restart the module.

ciscoasa# hw-module module 1 reload 
Reload module 1? [confirm]
Reload issued for module 1

Option 2: If you have the password to the SFR module, you can reboot the sensor directly from its command line.

This sensor must be managed by a Defense Center.  A unique alphanumeric registration
 key is always required.  In most cases, to register a sensor to a Defense Center,
 you must provide the hostname or the IP address along with the registration key.
 'configure manager add [hostname | ip address ] [registration key ]'

However, if the sensor and the Defense Center are separated by a NAT device, you
 must enter a unique NAT ID, along with the unique registration key. 'configure
 manager add DONTRESOLVE [registration key ] [ NAT ID ]'

Later, using the web interface on the Defense Center, you must use the same
 registration key and, if necessary, the same NAT ID when you add this
 sensor to the Defense Center.

Configure FireSIGHT Management Center
In order to manage an ASA FirePOWER module and security policy, you must register it with a FireSIGHT Management Center. You cannot do the following with a FireSIGHT Management Center:
Cannot configure ASA FirePOWER interfaces.
Cannot shut down, restart, or otherwise manage ASA FirePOWER processes.
Cannot create backups from or restore backups to ASA FirePOWER devices.
Cannot write access control rules to match traffic using VLAN tag conditions.
Redirect Traffic to SFR Module
You redirect traffic to the ASA FirePOWER module by creating a service policy that identifies specific traffic. In order to redirect traffic to a FirePOWER module, follow the steps below:
Step 1: Select Traffic
First, select traffic using access-list command. In the following example, we are redirecting all traffic from all of the interfaces. You could do it for specific traffic as well.
ciscoasa(config)# access-list sfr_redirect extended permit ip any any
Step 2: Match Traffic
The following example shows how to create a class-map and match the traffic on an access list:
ciscoasa(config)# class-map sfr
ciscoasa(config-cmap)# match access-list sfr_redirect
Step 3: Specify Action
You can configure your device in either a passive ("monitor-only") or inline deployment. You cannot configure both monitor-only mode and normal inline mode at the same time on the ASA. Only one type of security policy is allowed.
Inline Mode
In an inline deployment, after dropping undesired traffic and taking any other actions applied by policy, the traffic is returned to the ASA for further processing and ultimate transmission. The following example shows how to create a policy-map and configure the FirePOWER module in inline mode:
ciscoasa(config)# policy-map global_policy
ciscoasa(config-pmap)# class sfr
ciscoasa(config-pmap-c)# sfr fail-open
Passive Mode
In a passive deployment,
A copy of the traffic is sent to the device, but it is not returned to the ASA.
Passive mode lets you see what the device would have done to traffic, and lets you evaluate the content of the traffic, without impacting the network.
If you want to configure the FirePOWER module in passive mode, use the monitor-only keyword as below. If you do not include the keyword, the traffic is sent in inline mode.
ciscoasa(config-pmap-c)# sfr fail-open monitor-only
Step 4: Specify Location
The last step is to apply the policy. You can apply a policy globally or on an interface. You can override the global policy on an interface by applying a service policy to that interface. 
The global keyword applies the policy map to all interfaces, and interface applies the policy to one interface. Only one global policy is allowed. In the following example, the policy is applied globally:
ciscoasa(config)# service-policy global_policy global
Caution: The policy map global_policy is a default policy. If you use this policy and want to remove this policy on your device for troubleshooting purpose, make sure you understand its implication.
