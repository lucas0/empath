Product Overview
The Cisco® RF Gateway Downstream 48-1G Universal Edge QAM Line Card is a 12-port, 48-channel universal edge quadrature amplitude modulation (UEQAM) modulator designed for operation in the Cisco RF Gateway 10 platform. This line card is very similar in function to the standalone Cisco RF Gateway 1 Universal Edge QAM product, but the Cisco RF Gateway 10 can accommodate up 10x the density of the Cisco RF Gateway 1.
The Cisco RF Gateway Downstream 48-1G UEQAM line card offers concurrent support for standard and high-definition digital broadcast television, switched digital video (SDV), video-on-demand (VoD), and DOCSIS® modular cable modem termination system (M-CMTS™) services. Cable operators can choose to configure the line card as a DOCSIS only, video only, or DOCSIS and video shared universal edge QAM.
In the 10-slot Cisco RF Gateway 10 platform, RF Gateway Downstream 48-1G UEQAM line cards (Figure 1) can be configured with 1:N redundancy (up to 1:9), resulting in a fully protected, high-capacity, and highly dense edge QAM solution. For video services, the line cards can accept multiple formats of video content and provide a wide range of video processing features. Leading-edge RF technology is used to perform QAM modulation and RFupconversion, at significant space and power savings compared to existing upconverter architectures.

● Can support mixed annex environments on the same line card with granularity per port (for example, Annex B for DOCSIS, Annex A for video)
● 48 QAM channels per line card, up to 10 line cards per RF Gateway 10 chassis (up to 480 QAMs per chassis)
● High-capacity edge QAM solution reduces the total number of devices to manage and provides more scalable management than multiple standalone edge QAMs
High Availability
