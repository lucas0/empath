Introduction
There are two different ways to use high-level data link control (HDLC) over ISDN:
Define the physical interface to run HDLC. In other words, no encapsulation is defined since HDLC is the default encapsulation used by Cisco IOS® Software. This is the original way to configure HDLC with dial-on-demand routing (DDR) and is discussed in this document.
Use dialer interface to bind the protocol you want (in this example, HDLC) to a specific dialer. This is the newer method and allows for a specific physical interface to handle multiple protocols (for example, Point-to-Point Protocol [PPP] and HDLC). Since the protocol is configured on the dialer interface, the physical interface is not restricted. This method is known as Dynamic Multiple Encapsulations and is discussed in ISDN DDR using HDLC Encapsulation with Dynamic Multiple Encapsulations.
Prerequisites
Requirements
There are no specific requirements for this document.
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
The routers taxbol, and goya are 2500 series routers used in a lab environment with cleared configurations.
Cisco IOS Software Release 11.2(22) is used on both routers.
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Conventions
For more information on document conventions, refer to Cisco Technical Tips Conventions.
Why Use HDLC?
The reason why a user requires HDLC on the ISDN is not obvious, since it has a lot of disadvantages compared to PPP. The only purpose is to simplify the configuration. However, it also simplifies access to the router for any hackers. HDLC does not support any kind of authentication, hence the best protection here would be to verify the calling number with the isdn caller command on your interface. Refer to Configuring CLI Screening or ISDN Authentication and Callback with Caller ID for additional information. Calling line ID (CLID) based authentication assumes that your Telco supplies the calling number in the ISDN setup messages. However, since many Telcos do not supply CLID, verify with your Telco before you configure CLID-based screening. If CLID is not supplied by the Telco, then all incoming calls into the router fail.
Another disadvantage of HDLC is that the router does not install a dynamic map. Therefore, a dialer map needs to be configured (on each end) for the HDLC peer.
Note: If only one side makes the call (for example, one router always accepts the call and does not dialout) make sure that you include a name for the remote peer in the dialer map statement of the receiving side. However, the name can be a fake name since the router has no way to authenticate the peer name to determine if it matches the dialer map name.
For example, this is a description and this ISDN number is 8130.
  ip address 172.16.1.6 255.255.255.252 
  isdn caller 8129 

 !--- This is to accept only calls from 8129. 

  dialer map ip 172.16.1.5 name bogus_to_accept_command

 !--- This is a dialer-map with a fake name.

Verify
This section provides information you can use to confirm your configuration works properly.
Certain show commands are supported by the Output Interpreter Tool (registered customers only) , which allows you to view an analysis of show command output.
show interfaces bri number - Specifying only the number displays the D-channel for that BRI interface.
Command Description
number Interface number. The value is 0 through 7 if the router has one 8-port BRI NIM, or 0 through 15 if the router has two 8-port BRI NIMs. Interface number values vary, based on the hardware platform used. The Cisco 3600 series router for example, can have up to 48 interfaces.
No encapsulation was defined in the configuration, so by default it is HDLC. This can be verified with the show interface command as shown here:
 goya#show interfaces bri 0
