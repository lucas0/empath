Syntax Description
drop
Defines the action to drop matching packets.
accept
Defines the action to accept matching packets and to perform any specified actions.
count counter-name
Counts the packets that match the match criteria, saving the information to the specified filename.
log
Logs the packet headers into system logging (syslog) files.
set tloc ip-address color color [encap ecapsulation]
Sets the TLOC identified IP sddress and color
Directs matching packets to a TLOC identified by its IP address and color, and optionally, by its encapsulation.color can be 3g, biz-internet, blue, bronze, custom1, custom2, custom3, default, gold, green lte, metro-ethernet, mpls, private1 through private6, public-internet, red, and silver.
By default, encapsulation is ipsec. It can also be gre.
policer policer-name

Command Modes
Policy configuration (config-policy)
Command History
Release Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r
Command qualified for use in CLI templates.
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.5.1a
Added next-hop-loose keyword to redirect application traffic to an available route when next-hop address is not available.
Usage Guidelines
The sequence numbering feature applies sequence numbers to match-action pairs. The match–action pairs are evaluated in order, by sequence number, starting with the lowest numbered pair and ending when it matches the conditions in one of the pairs.
When a packet matches one of the match conditions, the defined action is taken. Or if no match occurs, the default action is taken.
This command can be used to define the action to take when the match portion in a match–action pair is met.

Note
The set next-hop-loose option can be applied only if set next-hop action is defined.
Example
The following example shows how to create a centralized control policy that changes the TLOC for accepted packets:

Command History
Release Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco SD-WAN Manager CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
Access control lists (ACLs) perform packet filtering to control which packets move through an interface of a router. The packet filtering provides security by helping to limit the network traffic, restrict the access of users and devices to a network, and prevent the traffic from leaving a network interface. An access control list is a sequential list consisting of match-action pairs.
The sequence numbering feature applies sequence numbers to match-action pairs. The match–action pairs are evaluated in order, by sequence number, starting with the lowest numbered pair and ending when it matches the conditions in one of the pairs.
When a packet matches one of the match conditions, the defined action is taken. Or if no match occurs, the default action is taken.
This command can be used to define the action to take when the match portion in a match–action pair is met.
Example
The following example creates an access control list named ACL-TEST-1, defines sequence #10, enters the match configuration mode, specifies destination IP 10.10.10.10/32 as a match parameter, and defines the action to drop and logs the packet when matched.
Device(config)# policy
Device(config-policy)# access-list ACL-TEST-1
Device(config-access-list-ACL-TEST-1)# sequence 10
Device(config-sequence-10)# match
Device(config-match)# destination-ip 10.10.10.10/32
Device(config-match)# exit
Device(config-sequence-10)# action drop
Device(config-action)# log
The following example creates an access control list named ACL-TEST-1, defines sequence #20, enters the match configuration mode, specifies packet length of 10 as a match parameter and defines the action to accept and applies the policer policy POL1 when matched.
Device(config)# policy
Device(config-policy)# access-list ACL-TEST-1
Device(config-access-list-ACL-TEST-1)# sequence 20
Device(config-sequence-20)# match
Device(config-match)# packet-length 10
Device(config-match)# exit
Device(config-sequence-20)# action accept
Device(config-action)# policer POL1

ip sla reaction-configuration
To configure proactive threshold monitoring parameters for an IP Service Level Agreements (SLAs) operation, use the ip sla reaction-configuration command in global configuration mode. To disable all the threshold monitoring configuration for a specified IP SLAs operation, use the no form of this command.
Syntax Description
operation-number
Number of the IP SLAs operation for which reactions are to be configured.
react monitored-element (continued)
packetLoss —Specifies that a reaction should occur if the packet loss value violates the upper threshold or lower threshold. The path of the packets is unknown.
packetLossDS —Specifies that a reaction should occur if the one-way destination-to-source packet loss value violates the upper threshold or lower threshold.
packetLossSD —Specifies that a reaction should occur if the one-way source-to-destination packet loss value violates the upper threshold or lower threshold.
rtt —Specifies that a reaction should occur if the round-trip time violates the upper threshold or lower threshold.
timeout —Specifies that a reaction should occur if there is a one-way timeout for the monitored operation. The threshold-value keyword does not apply to this monitored element.
action-type option
(Optional) Specifies what action or combination of actions the operation performs when threshold events occur. If the threshold-typenever keywords are defined, the action-type keyword is disabled. The option argument can be one of the following keywords:
none —No action is taken. This option is the default value.
trapAndTrigger —Trigger a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) trap and start another IP SLAs operation when the violation conditions are met, as defined in the trapOnly and triggerOnly options.
trapOnly —Send an SNMP logging trap when the specified violation type occurs for the monitored element.
triggerOnly —Transition one or more target operation’s operational state from pending to active when the violation conditions are met. The target operations to be triggered are specified using the ipslareaction-trigger command.
threshold-type average [number-of-measurements ]
(Optional) When the average of a specified number of measurements for the monitored element exceeds the upper threshold or when the average of a specified number of measurements for the monitored element drops below the lower threshold, perform the action defined by the action-type keyword. For example, if the upper threshold for reactrttthreshold-typeaverage3 is configured as 5000 ms and the last three results of the operation are 6000, 6000, and 5000 ms, the average would be 6000 + 6000 + 5000 = 17000/3 = 5667, thus violating the 5000 ms upper threshold.
The default number of 5 averaged measurements can be changed using the number-of-measurements argument. The valid range is from 1 to 16.
This syntax is not available if the connectionLoss , timeout , or verifyError keyword is specified as the monitored element, because upper and lower thresholds do not apply to these options.
threshold-type immediate
(Optional) When a threshold violation for the monitored element is met, immediately perform the action defined by the action-type keyword.
threshold-value upper-threshold lower-threshold
(Optional) Specifies the upper-threshold and lower-threshold values of the applicable monitored elements. See the Default Threshold Values for Monitored Elements table in the “Usage Guidelines” section for a list of the default values.
Note
  For MOS threshold values (reactmos ), the number is expressed in three digits representing ones, tenths, and hundredths. For example, to express a MOS threshold of 3.20, enter 320 . The valid range is from 100 (1.00) to 500 (5.00).

Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.4.1a
Command qualified for use in Cisco vManage CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
The loss command is used to specify the relative percentage or maximum number of packets that OER will permit to be lost during transmission on an exit link. If packet loss is greater than the user-defined or the default value, OER determines that the exit link is out-of-policy and searches for an alternate exit link.
The relative keyword is used to configure the relative packet loss percentage. The relative packet loss percentage is based on a comparison of short-term and long-term packet loss. The short-term measurement reflects the percentage of packet loss within a 5-minute period. The long-term measurement reflects the percentage of packet loss within a 60-minute period. The following formula is used to calculate this value:
Relative packet loss = ((short-term loss - long-term loss) / long-term loss) * 100
The master controller measures the difference between these two values as a percentage. If the percentage exceeds the user-defined or default value, the exit link is determined to be out-of-policy. For example, if long-term packet loss is 200 PPM and short-term packet loss is 300 PPM, the relative loss percentage is 50 percent.
The threshold keyword is used to configure the absolute maximum packet loss. The maximum value is based on the actual number of PPM that have been lost.
The following example configures the master controller to search for a new exit link if the difference between long- and short-term measurements (relative packet loss) is greater than 20 percent:
Router(config)# oer master
Router(config-oer-mc)# loss relative 200  
The following example configures OER to search for a new exit link when 20,000 packets have been lost:
Router(config)# oer master
Router(config-oer-mc)# loss threshold 20000

Cisco IOS XE Release 17.9.1a
This command was modified. Localized policy match configuration is enhanced to include source-tag-instance , and destination-tag-instance keyword parameters in matching attributes.
Usage Guidelines
Access control lists (ACLs) perform packet filtering to control which packets move through an interface of a router. Packet filtering provides security by helping to limit network traffic, restrict the access of users and devices to a network, and prevent the traffic from leaving a network interface. An access control list is a sequential list consisting of match-action pairs.
The Sequence Numbering feature applies sequence numbers to match-action pairs. The match–action pairs are evaluated in an order, by sequence number, starting with the lowest numbered pair and ending when it matches the conditions in one of the pairs.
When a packet matches one of the match conditions, the defined action is taken. Or, if no match occurs, the default action is taken.
The match command can be used to enter the match configuration mode or to define match parameters.
The following example shows how to create or enter an access control list named ACL-TEST-1, define sequence #10, specify the destination IP address 10.10.10.10/32 as a match parameter, and define the action to drop when matched:
Device(config)# policy
Device(config-policy)# access-list ACL-TEST-1

Usage Guidelines
Weighted fair queuing (WFQ) creates a queue for every class for which a class map is defined. Packets satisfying the match criteria for a class accumulate in the queue reserved for the class until they are sent, which occurs when the queue is serviced by the fair queuing process. When the maximum packet threshold you defined for the class is reached, queuing of any further packets to the class queue causes tail drop.
You use queue limits to configure Weighted Tail Drop (WTD). WTD ensures the configuration of more than one threshold per queue. Each class of service is dropped at a different threshold value to provide for QoS differentiation.
You can configure the maximum queue thresholds for the different subclasses of traffic.
This command can be used to specify or modify the maximum number of packets the queue can hold for a class policy configured in a policy map.
Example
The following example shows defining the maximum queue limit to 108 packets.
Router(config)# policy-map POL123 
Router(config-pmap)# class CLASS123 
Router(config-pmap-c)# bandwidth 1000 
Router(config-pmap-c)# queue-limit 108 packets 
rate

dscp dscp-value
DSCP value:
Assign a DSCP value to transit traffic.
Range: 0 through 63
mpls-exp-topmost mpls-exp-value
Multiprotocol label switching experimental field (MPLS EXP) value:
Assign an MPLS EXP value to traffic.
Note
  If you use the dscp keyword to assign a DSCP value to traffic that uses MPLS, the command maps the DSCP value to an MPLS EXP value using the standard mapping of DSCP to MPLS EXP. For information about this mapping, see the QoS: Classification Configuration Guide, Cisco IOS XE 17.
Range: 0 through 7
class class-name
Forwarding class name:
Name of the forwarding class.
rule-name
Rewrite rule name:
Name of the rewrite rule. It can be a text string from 1 through 32 characters long. When you apply a rewrite rule to an interface, the name must match one that you specified when you created the rule with the policy rewrite-rule configuration command.

Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v

Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a
Added the mpls-exp-topmost keyword.
Usage Guidelines
For traffic using IP, the rewrite-rule command assigns a value to the DSCP field of the IP header for outgoing traffic.
In carrier supporting carrier (CSC) scenarios, which use MPLS, the rewrite-rule command assigns the MPLS EXP value in the MPLS header for outgoing traffic. Use the rewrite-rule command using a CLI template or CLI add-on template, and the mpls-exp-topmost keyword. If, in a CSC scenario, you use the dscp keyword instead, such as with legacy configurations created before support of the mpls-exp-topmost keyword, the rewrite-rule command converts the DSCP value to an MPLS EXP value in accordance with the standard mapping of DSCP to MPLS EXP values. The benefit of using the mpls-exp-topmost keyword is that you can set the MPLS EXP value directly, without depending on the mapping of DSCP to MPLS EXP values.
The following example shows how to create a rewrite rule:
Device(config)# policy
Device(config-policy)# rewrite-rule Branch-QoS-Rewrite-Template
Device(config-policy)# class BULK low dscp 10
Device(config-policy)# class BULK high dscp 10
The following example applies to a CSC scenario. It defines a rewrite rule called rw-exp, which sets the MPLS EXP value for outgoing traffic to 1 and applies the rule to the outbound interface.
Define the rewrite rule using the mpls-exp-topmost keyword, as follows:
sdwan
  policy
    rewrite-rule rw-exp
      class BULK low mpls-exp-topmost 1
      class BULK high mpls-exp-topmost 1
Alternatively, if you define the rewrite rule using the dscp keyword, the rewrite-rule command converts the value of 10 to an MPLS EXP value of 1, in accordance with the standard mapping of DSCP to MPLS EXP values.
sdwan
  policy
    rewrite-rule rw-exp
      class BULK low dscp 10
      class BULK high dscp 10
Apply the rule as follows:

Release Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco SD-WAN Manager CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
Access control lists (ACLs) perform packet filtering to control which packets move through an interface of a router. The packet filtering provides security by helping to limit the network traffic, restrict the access of users and devices to a network, and prevent the traffic from leaving a network interface. An access control list is a sequential list consisting of match-action pairs.
The sequence numbering feature applies sequence numbers to match-action pairs. The match–action pairs are evaluated in order, by sequence number, starting with the lowest numbered pair and ending when it matches the conditions in one of the pairs.
When a packet matches one of the match conditions, the defined action is taken. Or if no match occurs, the default action is taken.
This command can be used to define the sequence number for a match-action pair in an access control list.
Example
The following example creates an access control list named ACL-TEST-1, defines sequence #10, specifies destination IP 10.10.10.10/32 as a match parameter and defines the action to drop when matched.
Device(config)# policy
Device(config-policy)# access-list ACL-TEST-1
Device(config-access-list-ACL-TEST-1)# sequence 10
Device(config-sequence-10)# match destination-ip 10.10.10.10/32
Device(config-match)# exit
Device(config-sequence-10)# action drop
The following example creates an access control list named ACL-TEST-1 and removes sequence #10 and the match-action pair.
Device(config)# policy
Device(config-policy)# access-list ACL-TEST-1
Device(config-access-list-ACL-TEST-1)# no sequence 10
