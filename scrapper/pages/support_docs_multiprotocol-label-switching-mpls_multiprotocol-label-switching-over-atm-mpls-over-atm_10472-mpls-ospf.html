Introduction
This document provides a sample configuration of a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) VPN over ATM when Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is present on the customer side, without area 0.
The Virtual Private Network (VPN) feature, when used with MPLS, allows several sites to transparently interconnect through the network of a service provider. One service provider network can support several different IP VPNs. Each of these appears to its users as a private network, separate from all other networks. Within a VPN, each site can send IP packets to any other site in the same VPN.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Each VPN is associated with one or more VPN routing or forwarding instances (VRFs). A VRF consists of an IP routing table, a derived Cisco express forwarding (CEF), table and a set of interfaces that use this forwarding table.
The router maintains a separate routing and CEF table for each VRF. With this, information cannot be sent outside the VPN but the same subnet can be used in several VPNs without duplicate IP address problems.
The router that uses Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) distributes the VPN routing information with the BGP extended communities.
For more information in regard to the propagation of updates through a VPN, refer to these URLs:

Hardware and Software Versions
These letters represent the different types of routers and switches used:
P : Provider core router
PE : Provider edge router
CE : Customer edge router
C : Customer router
We developed and tested the configuration with these software and hardware versions:
PE routers:
Software: Cisco IOS® Software Release 12.1(3)T . The MPLS VPN features appear in Release 12.0(5)T. The OSPF as PE-CE routing protocol appears in Release 12.0(7)T.
Hardware: The Cisco 3660 or 7206 routers. For details of other hardware you can use, refer to the Designing MPLS for ATM guide.
CE routers: Use any router that is able to exchange routing information with its PE router.
P routers and switches: The MPLS VPN integration function resides only on the edge of the MPLS network, so use any MPLS-capable switch. In the sample configuration, the MPLS cloud is composed of an 8540 MSR and a LightStream 1010. If you use the LightStream 1010, we recommend that you use software version WA4.8d or higher. You can also use other ATM switches, such as the Cisco BPX 8650 or MGX 8850 in the ATM core network.
Conventions
This diagram shows a typical configuration that uses these conventions:

OSPF Background Information
Traditionally, an elaborate OSPF network consists of a backbone area (area 0) and a number of areas connected to this backbone through an area border router (ABR).
With an MPLS backbone for VPN with OSPF on the customer site, you can introduce a third level in the hierarchy of the OSPF model. This third level is called the MPLS VPN super backbone.
In simple cases, the MPLS VPN super backbone is combined with the traditional area 0 backbone. This means that there is no area 0 backbone on the customer network since the MPLS VPN super backbone plays the same role as the area 0 backbone. This is shown in this diagram:
This diagram illustrates this information:
The provider-edge (PE) routers are ABR and autonomous system boundary router (ASBR) routers.
The customer-edge (CE) routers are simple OSPF routers.
The VPN information is transported through BGP extended communities from PEs to other PEs and is re-injected into the OSPF areas as Summary Network (type 3) link-state advertisements (LSAs).
The MPLS VPN super backbone also enables customers to use multiple area 0 backbones on their sites. Each site can have a separate area 0 as long as it is connected to the MPLS VPN super backbone. The result is the same as with a partitioned area 0 backbone. This is shown in this diagram:
In this case, these things occur:
The PE routers are ABR and ASBR routers.
The CE routers are ABR routers.
The LSAs that contain VPN information are transported with BGP extended communities from PEs to other PEs. In Summary Network (type 3) LSAs, information is transported between PEs and CEs.
This sample configuration is based on the first setup shown. You can find a sample configuration that uses the second setup in MPLS VPN over ATM: with OSPF on the Customer Side (with Area 0).
OSPF information is transported with BGP extended community attributes (which include one that identifies the OSPF network). Each VPN must have its own OSPF process. In order to specify this, you can use this command:
router ospf <process ID> vrf <VPN routing/forwarding instance name>
Configuration Procedure
In this section, you are presented with the information to configure the features described in this document.
Note: Use the Command Lookup Tool (registered customers only) to find more information on the commands used in this document.
Network Diagram
This document uses this network setup:
The Cisco IOS documentation (MPLS Virtual Private Networks) also describes this configuration procedure.
Configuration Procedure Part I
Make sure that ip cef is enabled. If you use a Cisco 7500 Router, you must ensure that ip cef distributed is enabled. On the PEs, once MPLS is set up, perform these tasks:
Create one VRF for each VPN connected with the ip vrf <VPN routing/forwarding instance name> command. When you do this:
Specify the correct route distinguisher used for that VPN. This is used to extend the IP address so that you can identify the VPN to which it belongs.
rd <VPN route distinguisher>
Set up the import and export properties for the BGP extended communities. These are used to filter the import and export process.
route-target [export|import|both] <target VPN extended community> 
Configure the forwarding details for the respectives interfaces with this command:
ip vrf forwarding <table name>
Remember to set up the IP address after you do this.
Dependent upon the PE-CE routing protocol that you use, you must now do one or more of these:
Configure the static routes:
ip route vrf vrf-name prefix mask [next-hop-address]
                                  [interface {interface-number}] 
Configure the RIP with this command:
address-family ipv4 vrf <VPN routing/forwarding instance name>
Once you have done this part, enter the normal RIP configuration commands.
Note: This is only applied to the forwarding interfaces for the current VRF.
Note: You have to redistribute the correct BGP into RIP. When you do this, also remember to specify the metric that is used.
Declare the BGP neighbor information.
Configure the OSPF with the new IOS command:
router ospf <process ID> vrf <VPN routing/forwarding instance name>
Note: This is only applied to the forwarding interfaces for the current VRF.
Note: You have to redistribute the correct BGP into OSPF. When you do this, also remember to specify the metric that is used.
Note: Once you attribute the OSPF process to a VRF, this process number is always used for this particular VRF. This applies even if you do not specify it in the command line.
Configuration Procedure Part II
Configure BGP between the PE routers. There are several ways to configure BGP, such as the use of the route reflector or confederation methods. The method used here – direct neighbor configuration – is the simplest and least scalable.
Declare the different neighbors.
Enter the address-family ipv4 vrf <VPN routing/forwarding instance name> for each VPN present at this PE router. Carry out one or more of these steps, as necessary:
Redistribute the static routing information.
Redistribute the RIP routing informations.
Redistribute the OSPF routing information.
Activate BGP neighbors with the CE routers.
Enter the address-family vpnv4 mode, and perform these tasks:
Activate the neighbors.
Specify that extended community must be used. This is mandatory.

Testing Output
You can now use ping to test that everything is fine:
Pivrnec#ping 7.7.7.7      
 
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 7.7.7.7, timeout is 2 seconds:
!!!!!
Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 1/2/4 ms
The traceroute command displays this output:
Pivrnec#traceroute 7.7.7.7
 
Type escape sequence to abort.
Tracing the route to 7.7.7.7

  2 150.150.0.1 0 msec 0 msec 20 msec
  3 150.150.0.2 0 msec 0 msec * 
The MLPS hosts are not here because they do not see the IP header. The MPLS hosts only check the inbound label or interface and then forward it.
The operation on the IP Time To Live (TTL) field is only carried out on the edge LSR. The hop count shown is less than the actual hop count.
