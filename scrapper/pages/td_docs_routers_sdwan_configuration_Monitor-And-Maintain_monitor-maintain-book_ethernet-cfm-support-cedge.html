Introduction to Ethernet CFM
Ethernet Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) is an end-to-end per-service-instance ethernet layer operation, administration, and management (OAM) protocol. It includes proactive connectivity monitoring, fault verification, and fault isolation for large ethernet metropolitan-area networks (MANs) and wide-area-networks (WANs). Service provider networks are large and complex and have a wide user base. OAM protocols help in isolating failures and responding to them in a timely manner.
How CFM Works in Cisco SD-WAN
In a network where the provider edge routers and customer premise equipment (CPE) are connected through carrier ethernet network, it is necessary to monitor the links for any breakage. With the support for CFM on carrier ethernet networks, CFM messages are exchanged between provider edges and CPEs, and the CFM protocol ensures the provider edge is aware of any link failures in the network.
CFM in Cisco SD-WAN is supported on these interface types:
VDSL interfaces
SHDSL interfaces
GigabitEthernet interfaces
The following components support the functioning of CFM on Cisco SD-WAN.
Down Maintenance End Points
Ethernet CFM and Ethernet OAM Interaction
SNMP Traps
Down Maintenance End Points
A maintenance domain is a management space for managing and administering a network. A domain is owned and operated by a single entity and defined by the set of ports internal to the domain and at its boundary. A maintenance association identifies a service that can be uniquely identified within the maintenance domain. The CFM protocol runs within a maintenance association.
A maintenance end point (MEP) is a demarcation point on an interface that participates in CFM within a maintenance domain. MEPs drop all lower-level frames and forward all higher-level frames. MEPs are defined per maintenance domain (level) and service (S-VLAN or ethernet virtual circuit (EVC)). They are at the edge of a domain and define the boundary and confine CFM messages within that boundary. MEPs can proactively transmit CFM continuity check messages (CCMs) and at the request of an administrator, transmit traceroute, and loopback messages.
A down MEP sends and receives CFM frames through the wire connected to the port on which the MEP is configured. For CFM frames coming from the relay side, the down MEP drops all lower-level frames and those that are at its level. For CFM frames coming from the wire side, the down MEP processes all frames at its level and drops lower-level frames, except for traffic going to the other lower level down MEP. The MEP transparently forwards all CFM frames at a higher level, regardless of whether they are received from the relay or through the wire.
In order to deploy down MEP per subinterface, you must first create a EVC+VLAN maintenance association, configure the VLAN id under the subinterface, and then configure down MEP under the parent interface of that subinterface.
Ethernet CFM and Ethernet OAM Interaction
Ethernet Virtual Circuit
An EVC as defined by the Metro Ethernet Forum is a port-level point-to-point or multipoint-to-multipoint Layer 2 circuit. EVC status can be used by an edge device either to find an alternative path into the service provider network or in some cases, to fall back to a backup path over Ethernet or over another alternative service such as asynchronous transfer mode (ATM).
OAM Manager
OAM manager is an infrastructure element that streamlines interaction between OAM protocols. The OAM manager requires two interworking OAM protocols, in this case, Ethernet CFM and Ethernet OAM. Interaction is unidirectional from the OAM manager to the CFM protocol and the only information exchanged is the user network interface (UNI) port status. Additional port status values available are:
REMOTE_EE—Remote excessive errors
LOCAL_EE—Local excessive errors
TEST—Either remote or local loopback
After CFM receives the port status, it communicates that status across the CFM domain.
SNMP Traps
MEPs generate two types of Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) traps: continuity check (CC) traps and cross-check traps.
Continuity check traps:
MEP up: Sent when a new MEP is discovered, the status of a remote port changes, or connectivity from a previously discovered MEP is restored after interruption.
MEP down: Sent when a timeout or last gasp event occurs.
Cross-connect: Sent when a service ID does not match the VLAN.
Loop: Sent when a MEP receives its own continuity check messages (CCM).
Configuration error: Sent when a MEP receives a continuity check with an overlapping MPID.
Cross check traps:
Service up: Sent when all expected remote MEPs are up in time.
MEP missing: Sent when an expected MEP is down.
Unknown MEP: Sent when a CCM is received from an unexpected MEP.
Restrictions for Configuring Ethernet CFM
You can configure CFM only through CLI on Cisco vManage. Therefore, you can access the CFM execution for link fault detection, verification and isolation in the SSH terminal of your device.
UP MEPs and maintenance intermediate points (MIPs) are not supported.
CFM trouble-shooting functionality such as, layer 2 traceroute and ping by CFM is not supported on Cisco vManage. This functionality can be executed only on the device.
Configure Ethernet CFM using Cisco vManage CLI Template
The following commands are used to configure Ethernet CFM.
To enable CFM IEEE version of CFM:
Device(config)# ethernet cfm ieee
To enable CFM processing globally on the device:
Device(config)# ethernet cfm global
To enable caching of CFM data learned through traceroute messages:
Device(config)# ethernet cfm traceroute cache
To enable ethernet CFM syslog messages:
Device(config)# ethernet cfm logging
To enable SNMP trap generation for ethernet CFM continuity check events:
Device(config)# snmp-server enable traps ethernet cfm cc
To enable SNMP trap generation for ethernet CFM continuity check events in relation to the cross-check operation between statically configured MEPs and those learned via CCMs:
csnmp-server enable traps ethernet cfm crosscheck
To define an EVC and enter EVC configuration mode:
Device(config)# ethernet evc evc-id
To define a CFM maintenance domain at a particular maintenance level and enter ethernet CFM configuration mode:
Device(config)# ethernet cfm domain domain-name level level-id
To include the sender ID TLVs and the attributes containing type, length, and values for neighbor devices:
Device(config)# sender-id chassis
To configure a maintenance association within a maintenance domain and enter ethernet CFM service configuration mode:
Device(config-ecfm)# service short-ma-name evc evc-name vlan vlanid direction down
To configure offload sampling:
Device(config)# offload sampling sample
To enable the transmission of CCMs:
Device(config-ecfm-srv)# continuity-check
To configure the time period between CCMs transmission (the default interval is 10 seconds):
Device(config-ecfm-srv)# continuity-check [interval cc-interval]
To configure the MEP domain and ID on the interface:
Device(config)# interface interface-name
Device(config-if)# cfm mep domain domain-name mpid id service service-name
For a detailed explanation on the purpose of each command, see Configuring Ethernet CFM.
