Objective
The Cisco FindIT Network Management provides tools that help you easily monitor, manage, and configure your Cisco 100 to 500 Series network devices such as switches, routers, and wireless access points (WAPs) using your web browser. It also notifies you about device and Cisco Support notifications such as the availability of new firmware, device status, network settings updates, and any connected devices that are no longer under warranty or covered by a support contract.
The FindIT Network Management is a distributed application which is comprised of two separate components or interfaces: one or more Probes referred to as FindIT Network Probe and a single Manager called FindIT Network Manager.
An instance of FindIT Network Probe installed at each site in the network performs network discovery, and communicates directly with each Cisco device. In a single site network, you may choose to run a standalone instance of FindIT Network Probe. However, if your network comprises multiple sites, you may install FindIT Network Manager at a convenient location and associate each Probe with the Manager. From the Manager interface, you can get a high-level view of the status of all the sites in your network, and connect to the Probe installed at a particular site when you wish to view a detailed information for that site.
This article provides instructions on how to install and configure FindIT Network Manager and FindIT Network Probe using the Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager.

Step 5. Click the downloaded OVA image in Step 1, then click Open.
Step 6. Click Next to continue.
Step 7. (Optional) Double-click the Name field to change the appliance name.
Note: In this example, FindIT Network Manager is used.
Step 8. Click Import.
Note: The FindIT Network Manager will be displayed in the list of virtual machines once it has been successfully deployed.
Step 9. On the left panel, click to choose the deployed FindIT Network Manager appliance.
Step 10. Click Start to access the console of the VM.
Configure the Deployed FindIT Network Manager
Once deployment of the FindIT Network Manager is completed using your preferred virtual machine, follow the steps below to configure the VM.
Step 1. Access the console of the FindIT Network Manager VM.
Step 2. Log in to the console using the default username and password: cisco/cisco.

Step 3. Once you are prompted to change the password for the cisco account, enter the current password.
Step 4. Enter and retype the new password for the cisco account.
The DHCP IP Address and Administration GUI addresses will be displayed.
Note: In this example, the IP Address of FindIT Network Manager is 192.168.1.101 and the Administration GUI address is https://192.168.1.101.
Step 5. Enter the sudoconfig_vm command to start the initial setup wizard.
Step 6. Enter the password for sudo. The default password is cisco. If you changed it, enter the new password.
Step 7. Enter y for Yes or n for No in the setup wizard to configure the Hostname, Network, NTP server, and Time Zone.
Step 8. (Optional) If DHCP is specified when configuring network, enter the ifconfig command to check the assigned IP address and remember it. A static IP can also be configured.
You should now have completed the FindIT Network Manager installation on your VM.
