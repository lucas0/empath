Description
Multicast over L3 TLOC Extension
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.2
Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1
This feature enables support for transport location (TLOC) which allows addition of the peers transport to avoid the extra cost of additional IP and allows the use of dynamic load balance across multiple transports.
Support for Multicast Overlay Routing Protocols
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r
This feature enables efficient distribution of one-to-many traffic. The multicast routing protocols like, IPv4 Multicast, IGMPv3, PIM SSM, PIM ASM, Auto RP and Static RP distribute data (for example, audio/video streaming broadcasts) to multiple recipients. Using multicast overlay protocols, a source can send a single packet of data to a single multicast address, which is then distributed to an entire group of recipients.
The Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN multicast overlay software extends Protocol Independent Multicast Source-Specific Multicast (PIM-SSM) over the Cisco SD-WAN overlay using Overlay Management Protocol (OMP). Protocol Independent Multicast Sparse-Mode (PIM-SM) is deployed in the customer VPNs, and the Cisco IOS XE MVPN is used to integrate PIM in customer VPNs and OMP in the overlay. The OMP replicator is used in overlay multicast to optimize the multicast distribution tree across the overlay topology. The Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN router supports IGMPv2 and IGMPv3 reports and advertises receiver's multicast interest to remote Cisco SD-WAN routers using OMP. Depending on the level of optimization required, the Cisco SD-WAN routers join or prune to or from the replicators, and replicators use OMP to relay the join or prune to the Cisco SD-WAN router providing overlay connectivity to the PIM-RP or source.
The Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN multicast overlay implementation extends native multicast by creating a secure optimized multicast tree that runs on top of the overlay network.

Limitations of Multicast Configuration
Multicast overlay routing does not support the following features:
MSDP/Anycast-RP on Cisco SD-WAN routers
IPv6 overlay and IPv6 underlay
Dynamic BFD tunnel for multicast
Multicast with asymmetric unicast routing
Multicast overlay working does not support Data Policy. In case data policy is configured, then only required traffic is matched and not multicast traffic.
Supported Protocols
The Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN overlay multicast network supports the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) and Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and multicast template configurations on all the platforms.
PIM
IGMP
MSDP
PIM
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN overlay multicast supports PIM version 2 (defined in RFC 4601 ), with some restrictions.
On the service side, the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN software supports native multicast. A router appears as a native PIM router and establishes PIM neighborship with other PIM routers at a local site. A Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN router supports a directly connected local source, referred as a first hop router (FHR). Receivers residing downstream of a router can join multicast streams by exchanging IGMP membership reports directly with the device, and no other routers are required. Additionally, the Cisco SD-WAN router can act as the PIM-RP for the local site.
On the transport side, PIM-enabled Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN routers originate multicast service routes (called multicast autodiscover routes), sending them using OMP to the Cisco vSmart Controllers. The multicast autodiscover routes indicate whether the router is a replicator and the local threshold. Each PIM router also conveys information learned from the PIM join messages sent by local-site multicast-enabled routers, including multicast group state, source information, and RPs. These routes assist Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN routers in performing optimized joins across the overlay when joining existing multicast sources.
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN routers support both PIM source-specific mode (SSM) and ASM (Any Source Multicast) mode.
Rendezvous Points
The root of a PIM multicast shared tree resides on a router configured to be a rendezvous point (RP). In the Cisco SD-WAN solution, RPs can be Cisco SD-WAN routers or non-Cisco SD-WAN routers that reside in the local site.
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN supports the following modes of RP discovery:
Static RP
Auto-RP
Auto-RP Proxy
Dynamic RP-group mappings are propagated in the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN solution using Auto-RP. ACLs can be used to control or map certain group ranges to a specific RP. With this information, each PIM router has the ability to forward joins to the correct RP for the group that a downstream IGMP client is attempting to join. Auto-RP updates are propagated to downstream PIM routers if such routers are present in the local site and across the overlay to the remote sites that belong to the same VPN. While using Auto-RP, Replicator Node should be configured as the Auto-RP mapping agent.
Another RP selection model called bootstrap router (BSR) was introduced after Auto-RP in PIM-SM version 2. Auto-RP is a Cisco proprietary protocol, whereas PIM BSR is part of the PIM version 2 specification. BSR performs similarly to Auto-RP in that it uses candidate routers for the RP function and for relaying the RP information for a group.
Replicators
For efficient use of WAN bandwidth, strategic Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN routers can be deployed and configured as replicators throughout the overlay network. Replicators mitigate the requirement for a Cisco SD-WAN router with local sources or the PIM-RP to replicate a multicast stream once for each receiver. As discussed above, replicators advertise themselves, using OMP multicast-autodiscover routes, to the Cisco vSmart Controllers in the overlay network. The controllers then forward the replicator location information to the PIM-enabled Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN routers that are in the same VPN as the replicator.
A replicator Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN router receives streams from multicast sources, replicates them, and forwards them to other Cisco SD-WAN routers with multicast receivers in the same VPN. The details of the replication process are discussed below, in the section Multicast Traffic Flow through the Overlay Network. A replicator is typically a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN router located at a colo-site or another site with a higher-speed connection to the WAN transport network.
Multicast Service Routes
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN routers send multicast service routes to the Cisco vSmart Controller using OMP. From these routes, the controller processes and forwards joins for requested multicast groups towards the source address or PIM-RP as specified in the original PIM join message that resulted in a Cisco SD-WAN router advertising the OMP multicast service route. The source address can be either the IP address of an RP if the originating router is attempting to join the PIM shared tree or the IP address of the actual source of the multicast stream if the originating router is attempting to join the source tree.
IGMP
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN routers support the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) V2 and V3 protocol. IGMP is used by IPv4 hosts and routers to indicate their interest and in receiving multicast traffic for particular multicast groups. IGMP v3 report is used to indicate interest for a particular multicast group traffic from a specific source. From these membership reports, Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN routers originate the corresponding PIM join or OMP service route advertisements.
MSDP
Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) is a method of connecting multiple PIM-SM domains, and it is used to discover multicast sources in other PIM domains. When MSDP is configured in a network, rendezvous points (RP) exchange source information with RPs in other domains by maintaining MSDP peer relationships with MSDP-enabled routers in other domains. This peering relationship occurs over a TCP connection. A Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device can be configured as a RP so that it discover active sources outside of its domain.
Figure 1. MSDP
Here is an illustration of the sequence of events that occur when MSDP is implemented:
When a PIM designated router (DR) in domain A registers a source with its RP in domain A, the RP sends a Source Active (SA) message to all of its RP MSDP peers. The SA message identifies the source address, the group that the source is sending to, and the address or the originator ID of the RP, if configured.
The RP MSDP peer in domain B when it receives the SA message sends the SA message to all of its peers downstream.
The RP MSDP peer in domain B checks if there are any receivers of the advertised groups in its domain. If there are receivers in the group, the RP MSDP peer in domain B sends an (S, G) join toward the source. As a result, a connection is established between domain A and domain B. As multicast packets arrive at the RP, they are then forwarded down to the receivers in the RP’s domain. When the receivers receiving the multicast traffic learns of the source outside the PIM-SM domain (through the arrival of a multicast packet from the source), it can then send a PIM join toward the source and join source’s domain to receive the multicast traffic.
Traffic Flow in Multicast Overlay Routing
The following illustration represents the example topology for multicast overlay routing on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices:
Figure 2. Multicast Overlay Routing Topology
Configure Multicast Overlay Routing
For any Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN routers to be able to participate in the multicast overlay network, you must configure PIM on those routers.
Prerequisites
If you want to limit rendezvous point (RP) selection, configure an IPv4 ACL using a CLI add-on template. Configure an IPv4 ACL using a standard or extended access list and attach it to your device before enabling PIM. You must have created a valid standard or extended ACL prior to using the ACL in your multicast configuration.

Note
You cannot configure an ACL for a PIM feature template using Cisco vManage. You must configure the ACL using a CLI add-on template. The Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN multicast overlay implementation supports IOS XE standard or extended access lists.
At least one replicator is mandatory for overlay multicast configuration.
You can optionally configure IGMP to allow individual hosts on the service side to join multicast groups within a particular VPN.

Configure PIM Interfaces
If the router is just a multicast replicator and is not part of a local network that contains either multicast sources or receivers, you do not need to configure any PIM interfaces. The replicator learns the locations of multicast sources and receivers from the OMP messages it exchanges with the Cisco vSmart Controller. These control plane messages are exchanged in the transport VPN (VPN 0). Similarly, other Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices discover replicators dynamically, through OMP messages from the Cisco vSmart Controller.
To configure PIM interfaces, click Interface. Then click Add New Interface and configure the following parameters:

Rendezvous Point Selection Process by a PIM BSR
Table 9. Feature History
Feature Name
Release Information
Description
Dynamic Rendezvous Point (RP) Selection by a PIM BSR
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.5.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.5.1
This feature adds support for automatic selection of an RP candidate using a PIM BSR in an IPv4 multicast overlay. There is no single point of failure because every site has a local RP.
A Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device is selected as the RP, not a service-side device.
PIM uses a BSR to discover and announce RP-set information for each group prefix to all the routers in a PIM domain. This is the same function performed by Auto-RP, but a BSR is part of the PIM version 2 specification.

Note
Cisco Auto-RP cannot co-exist with PIM BSR. Cisco Auto-RP mode must be disabled with spt-only mode.
To avoid a single point of failure, you can configure several candidate BSRs in a PIM domain. A BSR is selected among the candidate BSRs automatically. The BSRs use bootstrap messages to discover which BSR has the highest priority. This router then announces to all PIM routers in the PIM domain that it is the BSR. Any router in the network can be a BSR candidate.
The elected BSR receives candidate-RP messages from all the candidate RPs in the domain. The bootstrap message sent by a BSR includes information about all of the candidate RPs.
An RP acts as the meeting place for sources and receivers of multicast data. In a PIM-SM network, sources must send their traffic to the RP. This traffic is then forwarded to receivers down a shared distribution tree. By default, when the first hop router of the receiver learns about the source, it sends a join message directly to the source, creating a source-based distribution tree from the source to the receiver. This source tree does not include a RP unless the RP is located within the shortest path between the source and the receiver.

Note
For a BSR to work for any multicast stream that spans across Cisco SD-WAN sites, SPT-only mode is mandatory. For a BSR within a local-site multicast stream within a Cisco SD-WAN site, it is not necessary to enable SPT-only mode.

Note
If you have two Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices in the same site, every Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device needs to be configured as a replicator for traffic to flow.

Configure MSDP Using a CLI Template
Before You Begin

Note
By enabling an MSDP peer, you implicitly enable MSDP.
IP multicast routing must be enabled and PIM-SM must be configured. For more information, see Configure PIM.
Configure MSDP Using a CLI Template
For more information about using CLI templates, see CLI Add-On Feature Templates and CLI Templates.

Note
By default, CLI templates execute commands in global config mode.
This section provides example CLI configurations to configure MSDP.
Enable MSDP and configure an MSDP peer as specified by the DNS name or IP address.
ip msdp peer peer ip address connect-source 
If you specify the connect-source keyword, the primary address of the specified local interface type and number values are used as the source IP address for the TCP connection. The connect-source keyword is recommended, especially for MSDP peers on a border that peer with a device inside of a remote domain.
Configure an originating address.
Perform this optional task to allow an MSDP speaker that originates an SA message to use the IP address of its interface as the RP address in the SA message.
You can also change the originator ID for any one of the following reasons:
If you configure multiple devices in an MSDP mesh group for Anycast RP.
If you have a device that borders a PIM-SM domain and a PIM-DM domain. If a device borders a PIM-SM domain and a PIM-DM domain and you want to advertise active sources within the PIM-DM domain, configure the RP address in SA messages to be the address of the originating device’s interface.
ip msdp originator-id type number 
Configure an MSDP Mesh Group.
Configures an MSDP mesh group and indicates that an MSDP peer belongs to that mesh group.

Note
You can configure multiple mesh groups per device.
ip msdp mesh-group mesh name{peer-ip address | peer name} 

Note
All MSDP peers on a device that participate in a mesh group must be fully meshed with all other MSDP peers in the group. Each MSDP peer on each device must be configured as a peer using the ip msdp peer command and also as a member of the mesh group using the ip msdp mesh-group command.

Information About Support for MSDP to Interconnect Cisco SD-WAN and Non-SD-WAN
MSDP facilitates interconnection of multiple Protocol Independent Multicast Sparse-Mode (PIM-SM) domains. When MSDP is enabled on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices, a rendezvous point (RP) in a PIM-SM domain maintains MSDP peering relationships with MSDP-enabled routers in other domains. For more information about MSDP, see MSDP.
From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.11.1a, you can configure Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices for MSDP interoperability with other devices. When Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices are configured for MSDP interoperability, they convert Source Active (SA) messages received from MSDP peers into OMP routes, and vice-versa.
The following illustration depicts MSDP interoperability between Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices in Cisco SD-WAN and devices in a non-SD-WAN setup.
Figure 4. MSDP Interoperability
Single Homed Network
In the sample topology, MSDP interoperability is enabled on the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device, R20, at site 2. R3 is configured as an RP for its PIM domain at the non-SD-WAN site. MSDP peering is established between R3 at the non-SD-WAN site and on R20 at site 2. When source H2 sends traffic to R4, R4 initiates a data registration with R3, and thereafter, R3 sends an MSDP SA message to R20. As MSDP interoperability is enabled in R20, R20 converts the received MSDP SA message to OMP SA routes, and then advertises them to all Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices located at other sites through the Cisco vSmart controller serving the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. When the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device R10 at site 1 receives this OMP SA route, R10 converts the OMP SA route into MSDP SA message and advertises the MSDP SA message to its MSDP peer R2 at the non-SD-WAN site. If R2 has any receivers interested in the group advertised in MSDP SA message, then R2 sends a (S,G) join towards the source. As a result, a inter-domain source tree is established across Cisco SD-WAN. As multicast packets arrive at R2 (RP), they are then forwarded down its own shared tree to the group members in the RP’s domain. R20 withdraws the advertised OMP SA route only when the MSDP SA message expires.
Dual-Homed Network
A dual home network is where there are two Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices configured for MSDP interoperability. In the dual-homed Cisco SD-WAN site 3, MSDP peering must be established between the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices R30, R40, and the non-SDWAN device R5. When the source registers its traffic with the RP R5, R5 sends a MSDP SA message to both R30 and R40. When R30 receives the MSDP SA message, it converts the MSDP SA message into OMP SA routes and then advertises to all the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices located at other sites, and to R40 within the same, site 3. MSDP SA filter must be configured between R30 and R40 to drop the SA message received from other Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices and sites through the Overlay Management Protocol (OMP). The Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device R10 at site 1 receives two OMP SA routes for the same Source Group (S, G) and caches them both. R10 then converts the OMP SA route into MSDP SA message and advertises to its MSDP peer R2 at the non-SD-WAN site. If R2 has any receivers interested in the group advertised in MSDP SA message, then R2 sends a (S,G) join towards the source. As a result, a inter-domain source tree is established across Cisco SD-WAN.
MSDP supports the following scenarios where Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices at the Cisco SD-WAN sites are configured for MSDP interoperability with other devices located in the non-SD-WAN sites.
Source devices located at the Cisco SD-WAN sites, and receivers at the Cisco SD-WAN and non-SD-WAN sites.
Source devices located in the non-SD-WAN sites, and receivers at the Cisco SD-WAN and non-SD-WAN sites.
In Dual border sites, where two devices are configured for MSDP interoperability in Cisco SD-WAN where sources and receivers are located in the Cisco SD-WAN sites.
In dual border sites, where two devices are configured for MSDP interoperability in non-SD-WAN, and where sources and receivers are located at the non-SD-WAN sites.
A Replicator can be any Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device located in the Cisco SD-WAN site. For more information about Replicators, see the Replicators section in PIM.
Benefits of Support for MSDP to Interconnect Cisco SD-WAN and non-SD-WAN
Facilitates MSDP interoperability between devices located at the Cisco SD-WAN sites and devices at the non-SD-WAN sites.
Prerequisites for Support for MSDP to Interconnect Cisco SD-WAN and Non-SD-WAN
For MSDP interoperability to work, you must enable shortest-path tree (SPT) SPT-only mode on a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device, and the device must be selected as an RP. For more information, see the Basic Configuration section in Configure Multicast Using Configuration Groups.
For MSDP interoperability, the peer devices must be set up in a mesh group.
In a dual-homed setup, configure an MSDP SA filter on a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device to drop MSDP SA messages from the other Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device.
Restrictions for Support for MSDP to Interconnect Cisco SD-WAN and Non-SD-WAN
Only one MSDP mesh group is supported per site in Cisco SD-WAN.
The MSDP peer devices must be located at the same site and cannot be spread across sites.
Configure MSDP to Interconnect Cisco SD-WAN and Non-SD-WAN

Troubleshooting
MSDP SA Cache Not Populated
OMP SA Route Not Advertised
MSDP SA Cache Not Populated
Problem MSDP SA cache is not populated on a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device when a source in a site sends traffic.
Possible Cause Check if there are any connectivity or configuration issues between the MSDP peers.
Solution To resolve the problem, do the following:
Solution Check the MSDP peering status between the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device and the device in non-SD-WAN.
Solution Verity that these commands msdp-interworking and spt-only are configured in the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device.
OMP SA Route Not Advertised
Problem A Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device does not advertise the OMP SA route when it receives a MSDP SA message from a MSDP peer.
Possible Cause  msdp-interworking configuration could be missing.
Solution Configure the msdp-interworking command in the correct VRF.
