View Team Performance
Use the Team Performance gadget to view the agents on each of your assigned teams.
Procedure
Step 1
In the Team Performance gadget, you can view the details of the team selected by default in the Team Name drop-down.
A list of agents for the selected team with their current state, time in state, extension, and action appears. Click the headers of the columns to sort by Agent Name, State, Time in State, or Extension.
Note
  For the Time in State to appear for logged out and Not Ready agents, the agent state must have changed at least once post server restart.
By default, the list will only contain logged in agents for the selected team. To view both, logged in and logged out agents, check the Include logged out agents check box.
Note
  Use the Search box to refine any agent details by using the search criterion such as Agent Name, State, or Extension. The search results are retained even when you switch between tabs during the active session.
Select an agent and in the corresponding row, click under the Actions tab to monitor the agent, change the state to Ready, Not Ready, or Sign Out the agent.
Note
  The Time in State field refreshes every 10 seconds. When Finesse receives the next agent state change event for an agent, the timer resets to 0.
Step 2
To view another team, click the Team Name drop-down and choose a new team.

Change the State of an Agent
Use the Team Performance gadget to change the state of an agent to Ready, Not Ready, or Sign Out.
Procedure
Step 1
From the Team Name drop-down list, choose the agent's team.
Step 2
From the displayed list, choose the agent whose state you want to change.
Step 3
In the Actions tab of the selected agent, click and choose:
Ready
To force the agent state to Ready.
Not Ready
To force the agent state to Not Ready.
Sign Out
To sign the agent out.
In the Actions tab, the Ready, Not Ready, and Sign Out options are active only if the action is allowed.
For example, if you select an agent who is in Ready state, you will see only the Not Ready and Sign Out options. If you select an agent who is in Not Ready state, you will see only the Ready and Sign Out options.
If you sign out an agent on an active call (in Talking state), or has a call on hold (in Hold state), that agent is immediately signed out of the desktop but the call is retained.
Monitor a Call
You must be in Not Ready state to monitor an agent. You can monitor only one agent at a time. To monitor another agent, you must End the silent monitoring call and then select a new agent.
Procedure
Step 1
From the Team Name drop-down list, choose the team whose agents you want to monitor.
Step 2
From the displayed list, choose an agent to monitor.
Step 3
In the Actions tab of the selected agent, click > Monitor.
The silent monitor call appears in the call control area of the desktop. The Hold, Barge In, and End buttons are enabled. Click:
Hold
To place the call on hold.
Retrieve
To retrieve the call placed on hold.
Barge In
To barge in to the call.
Step 4
To end the silent monitor call, click End.
Note
  The monitoring initiated on a consult call terminates, when the consult call is conferenced. This is due to the temporary nature of the monitored call. The monitoring must be re-initiated again, to monitor the conferenced call which is already in progress. Please note that monitoring initiated on a call before the consult call is placed, will not be affected due to conferencing activity and continues without disruption.
Barge In on a Call
The Barge In feature allows you to join a call between an agent and a caller.

Note
You can only barge in on a call that you are silently monitoring.
For the supervisor to be able to barge in, the agent and supervisor extensions must have visibility to each other's partition or calling search space (CSS) without any prefix or steering digit.
Procedure
Step 1
From the Team Name drop-down list, choose the agent's team.
Step 2
From the displayed list, choose an agent in the Talking state.
Step 3
In the Actions tab of the selected agent, click > Monitor.
The silent monitor call appears in the call control area of your desktop. The Barge In button appears.
Step 4
Click Barge In.
The call becomes a conference call between you, the agent, and the caller.
Intercept a Call
If you have initiated the conference call you can drop other agents, supervisors, or non-agents from the conference call based on the permission defined by your administrator.
The non-agents in the conference call include the caller, CTI Route Point, IVR port, a device to which no agent is signed in, or a caller device.
The Drop button is displayed on the call control area only if the administrator has set the permission for you to drop participants from the conference call.
Procedure
Step 1
Click Drop.
The agents, supervisors, or non-agents from the conference call are displayed. The agents and supervisors are prefixed with the icon () followed by the extension that is used to sign-in to the Finesse desktop. The non-agents are prefixed with the icon () followed by the ID of the caller device, CTI Route Point, IVR port, or a device to which no agent is signed in.
Step 2
Click the agent, supervisor or non-agent to drop from the list of participants.
A prompt message is displayed to confirm the participant to be dropped from the conference call.
Step 3
Click Drop.
Limitation
Finesse desktop cannot distinguish agents from another peripheral gateway (PG) as agents. So the agents from another PG are displayed using the same icon used for non-agents () in the Finesse desktop.
Send Team Message
The Team Message feature allows you to create and send a broadcast message to one or multiple teams. The message appears as a banner across the Finesse desktop and agents can view these messages in real-time. Team Message will be available on your Finesse desktop only if the administrator has configured this feature for you.
Procedure
Step 1
In the Finesse desktop, click the Team Message icon.
Step 2
In the Compose Message box, enter the broadcast message (maximum number of characters allowed is 255).
Step 3
Select the team or teams to send the message by checking the check box next to the team name.
Note
  You can send multiple messages to a single team, multiple teams, or all teams.
Step 4
From the drop-down, you can set an expiry time for the composed messages: starting at 5 minutes and ending at 23:55 hours. The time is displayed in hours and minutes. However, this time frame can be edited.
Step 5
Click Send.
You can view the latest messages sent by clicking Show recent messages. If you wish to delete any or all messages, check the check box next to the message. Click Delete and confirm the deletion.
The message is removed from active display and the previous non-expired team message will become the active message for the agent.
Note
  Administrator or supervisor who creates a Team Message can delete the created Team Message through TeamMessage API. For more information on deleting a TeamMessage, see https://developer.cisco.com/docs/finesse/#teammessagedelete-a-team-message.

Note
The rate at which messages (create/delete) are published to the teams involved, is capped at per hour and the maximum number of active messages allowed is . If the limit of active messages is reached, supervisors will not be able to broadcast new messages until an existing team message is deleted or it expires.
As there are no individual limitations on supervisors, either one or all supervisors can broadcast messages up to the maximum active messages limit.
