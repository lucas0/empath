Failures loading websites using TLS 1.3 with SSL inspection enabled
  Affected Platforms:
All physical and virtual managed devices, meaning those that run Firepower Threat Defense and ASA with FirePOWER Services
  Symptom:
With an SSL inspection policy enabled, TLS 1.3 connections fail for traffic that matches SSL decryption rules. 
  Starting in March 2018, certain web browsers are being updated to prefer TLS 1.3 traffic over TLS 1.2 traffic. In that case, connections between browsers and websites that support TLS 1.3 fail to establish.
  Users see the following error in their browser:
  ERR_SSL_VERSION_INTERFERENCE
  In addition, TLS version 1.3 traffic is not decrypted or inspected.
  Conditions:
·         SSL inspection policy is enabled on the managed device
·         TLS 1.3 is enabled in the browser because of a browser update
·         The user browses to a web site that supports TLS 1.3
 
  Workaround:
Configure each managed device to remove support for TLS 1.3 and instead negotiate an encrypted connection using TLS 1.2.
  On your managed device, use the following steps:
  ·         Log into the CLI using an SSH client to make a connection to the management IP address. Log in using the admin username (default password is Admin123) or as another CLI user account. 

For more information:
·         Firepower Threat Defense devices: Chapter on using the CLI in the Command Reference for Firepower Threat Defense for Firepower Threat Defense devices 
·         Classic devices: “Logging Into the Command Line Interface on Classic Devices” in the Firepower Management Center Configuration Guide.
·         At the > prompt, enter the following command:

system support ssl-client-hello-tuning extensions_remove 43

(43 is the identifier for the TLS 1.3 protocol.)
·         Follow the prompts on your screen to restart the detection engine, Snort. For example:

pmtool restartbytype DetectionEngine

·         Enter the following command to confirm the configuration change:

system support ssl-client-hello-display
  The following is displayed to confirm the change was successful:
extensions_remove=43
