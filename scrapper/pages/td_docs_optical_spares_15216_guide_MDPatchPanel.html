Installing the Cisco ONS 15216-MD-48-ODD, 15216-MD-48-ODDE, 15216-MD-48-EVENE, and 15216-MD-48-EVEN Mux/Demux Exposed Faceplate Patch Panels
This document explains how to install and operate the Cisco ONS 15216-MD-48-ODD, 15216-MD-48-ODDE, 15216-MD-48-EVENE, and 15216-MD-48-EVEN Mux/Demux Exposed Faceplate patch panels.
Overview of the ONS 15216-MD-48-ODD, ONS 15216-MD-48-ODDE, and ONS 15216-MD-48-EVENE and ONS 15216-MD-48-EVEN Mux/Demux Patch Panels
The ONS 15216-MD-48-ODD=/15216-MD-48-ODDE= and ONS 15216-MD-48-EVEN=/15216-MD-48-EVENE= units are the Cisco ONS 15216 exposed faceplate multiplexer/demultiplexer patch panels of 48-channels spaced at 100 GHz on the odd or even ITU grid respectively. The difference between the ONS 15216-MD-48-ODD/15216-MD-48-ODDE and ONS 15216-MD-48-EVEN/15216-MD-48-EVENE patch panel is the operating 100 GHz ITU grid.
The ONS 15216-MD-48-ODD/15216-MD-48-ODDE or ONS 15216-MD-48-EVEN/15216-MD-48-EVENE patch panel enables 48-channels of ITU wavelengths to be placed or removed from a single fiber. For C-band channel wavelength plan for the odd and even patch panels, see "Channel Wavelength Allocation".

Note
Unless otherwise specified, "ONS 15216-MD", , or “Patch Panel” refers to both odd and even patch panels. The odd and even patch panels mentioned in this document refers to the Cisco ONS 15216-MD-48-ODD/15216-MD-48-ODDE and Cisco ONS 15216-MD-48-EVEN/15216-MD-48-EVENE patch panels.
The patch panel can combine 48-channels of ITU wavelengths spaced at 100 GHz to a denser DWDM signal and separate the combined signal to 48-channels of ITU wavelengths spaced at 100 GHz. To increase the network capacity, the patch panel is plugged with a Cisco ONS 15216 50/100 GHz Interleaver and Deinterleaver module (15216-MD-48-CM) for ONS 15216-MD-48-ODD= and ONS 15216-MD-48-EVEN= units. To increase the network capacity, the patch panel is plugged with a Cisco ONS 15216 50/100 GHz Coupler and Splitter module (15216-MD-48-CME) for ONS 15216-MD-48-ODDE= and ONS 15216-MD-48-EVENE= units. The patch panel can then be used along with another patch panel of a different grid (odd or even).
The interleaver or coupler module combines the signals from the 15216-MD-48-ODD/15216-MD-48-ODDE and 15216-MD-48-EVEN/15216-MD-48-EVENE patch panels spaced at 100 GHz to a denser DWDM signal spaced at 50 GHz and the deinterleaver or splitter module splits the combined signal (96 channel signal) to the 15216-MD-48-ODD/15216-MD-48-ODDE and 15216-MD-48-EVEN/15216-MD-48-EVENE patch panels in the opposite direction.

Note
Cisco NCS 2000 Series does not support the 15216-MD-48-ODDE and 15216-MD-48-EVENE patch panels.
The monitor ports on the 15216-MD-48-ODDE and 15216-MD-48-EVENE patch panels are reserved for future features.
Features
The Cisco ONS 15216 MD 48-channel mux/demux patch panel provides signal multiplexing and demultiplexing in 100 GHz channel-spacing DWDM systems. It is optically and electrically passive and requires no temperature control. It uses fused fiber coupler and birefringent crystal technologies. The ultra-low dispersion of the patch panel coupled with the wide bandwidth reduces dispersion accumulation and bandwidth narrowing, making the patch panel ideal for multi-OADM metro-ring or mesh-based architectures.
Some of the operating features of the patch panel include:
Low dispersion
Low insertion loss
High channel isolation
Wide clear bandwidth
Full C-band coverage
Multiplex and demultiplex 48-channels
Athermal design
The patch panel works with 50 GHz and 100 GHz WXC cards. However, when used with a 50 GHz card, the patch panel should be used with a pluggable interleaver and deinterleaver module along with another patch panel of a different grid (odd or even).
The patch panel can be used in these scenarios:
Point-to-point network
Hub node for an open-ring network
Multiplex add/drop for multi-degree ROADM
Functional Description
The functional unit of the ONS 15216 odd and even patch panel is the passive athermal AWG (arrayed waveguide grating) optical module. The athermal AWG optical module comprises mux and demux modules as shown in the following figure:
Figure 1. Mux and Demux Athermal AWG Modules



The mux module combines signals from Chi-RX ports (48-channels) into the aggregated COM-TX port. An integrated tap-coupler combines the aggregated signals with the additional external sources injected at AUX-MUX port and splits 1% of the aggregated signals towards the MON-MUX port that is used for monitoring purpose.
The demux module separates the aggregated signals into individual Chi-TX ports. An integrated tap-coupler splits 1% of the aggregated signals coming from the COM-RX port towards MON-DMX port that is used for monitoring.

Performance Monitoring
The patch panel uses Optical Test Access Port (TAP) devices to enable passive access and monitoring in the fiber-optic network. TAPs enable network-based intrusion detection system sensors to operate efficiently without interruption. They send traffic data to a monitoring device by splitting the network signal, without introducing delay or changing the content or structure of the information contained in the packets. An optical spectrum analyzer (OSA) ) or power meter (PM) can be used for optical power monitoring and optical analysis.
The following table shows the manufacturer-specified TAP split ratios for the TAP coupler optical power in the patch panel. The split ratio denotes the ratio of the TAP input signal to the output signal.

Cleaning and Maintaining Fiber-Optic Connectors
Connector cleaning is required to maintain the performance of fiber-optic circuits. It is important that both the LC/UPC connector at the end of the fiber-optic cable and the optical mating adapter on the front panel of the device are clean before the connection is made.

Warning
Invisible laser radiation may be emitted from disconnected fibers or connectors. Do not stare into beams or view directly with optical instruments. Statement 1051
The following warning applies to disposal of chemicals and other materials used to clean connectors and adapters:

Warning
Ultimate disposal of this product should be handled according to all national laws and regulations. Statement 1040

Note
Before installing the fiber-optic cable, always perform the cleaning procedure for cable connectors described in the following section. Whenever possible, inspect each connector before connecting it to the optical mating adapter on the front panel.

Note
The LC optical mating adapter on the faceplate of the device is less likely to get dirty if it is capped when not in use. On some devices, the optical mating adapter has a shutter. The shutter automatically closes when the LC/UPC connector is disconnected. This prevents entry of dirt.
The procedure for a thorough cleaning of these adapters is complicated. Use a commercially available cleaning kit and closely follow the instructions included with the kit.
Customer-supplied Cleaning Materials
The Type A fiber optic connector cleaners (for example, CLETOP reel) are recommended to clean the cable connectors, but are not supplied with the device.
If properly maintained (only used with clean, defect-free fiber connectors and capped when not in use), the mating adapter would not require cleaning. However, if you suspect the adapter is dirty, clean it by using the CLETOP stick swab.

Note
For multifiber cable assemblies, use specific cleaning tools or materials designed for the assembly type.
Cleaning the Optical Mating Adapter
Procedure
Step 1   Read the cartridge cleaning instructions (provided by the manufacturer) to insert the cartridge cleaning tip into the optical mating adapter.
Step 2   Slide the lever on the cartridge to swipe the mating surface.
Note   
Always keep unused adapter ports and fiber connectors capped with a clean dust cap. The optical mating adapters that have shutter need not be capped.
Cleaning Fiber-Optic Cable Connectors
The tools required to clean fiber connectors are:
Inspection microscope
Type A Fiber Optic Connector Cleaner (CLETOP reel)
Optical swab
Optical receiver cleaning stick
Procedure
Step 1   Using an inspection microscope, inspect each fiber connector for dirt, cracks, or scratches.
Step 2   Replace any damaged fiber connectors.
Note    Replace all dust caps whenever the equipment is unused for 30 minutes or more.
Caution   
Do not reuse optical swabs. Keep unused swabs off of work surfaces.
Step 3   Clean the fiber connectors with CLETOP reel:
If present, remove the dust cap from the fiber connector.
Press the lever down to open the shutter door. Each time you press the lever, you expose a clean wiping surface.
Insert the connector into the CLETOP cleaning cassette slot, rotate one-quarter turn, and gently swipe downwards.
Use an inspection microscope to inspect each fiber connector for dirt, cracks, or scratches. If the connector is not clean, repeat the above sub-steps.
Insert the fiber connector into the applicable adapter or attach a dust cap to the fiber connector.
Note    Before replacing a dust cap on a connector, verify that the dust cap is clean. To clean the dust cap, wipe the outside of the cap using a dry, lint-free wipe and the inside of the dust cap using a CLETOP stick swab (14100400).

1 The Insertion Loss (IL) values are measured as the maximum IL inside the Operating Wavelength Bandwidth (± 80 pm, centered on each ITU wavelength of the channel).
2 Insertion Loss Uniformity is defined as the difference between the maximum insertion losses over any two operating wavelength bandwidths.
3 Adjacent Channel Isolation is defined as the difference between the maximum IL in the 100 GHz transmitted channel Bandwidth (ITU ± 80 pm) and the minimum IL measured over the Operating Wavelength Bandwidth of both adjacent 100 GHz channels.
4 Non-Adjacent Channel Isolation is defined as the difference between the maximum IL in the 100 GHz transmitted channel Bandwidth (ITU ± 80 pm) and the minimum IL measured over the Operating Wavelength Bandwidth of both non-adjacent 100 GHz channels.
5 The difference between the maximum and minimum group delay in the Operating Wavelength Bandwidth of each channel evaluated at all SOP.
6 Chromatic Dispersion is defined as the maximum derivative of the Group Delay versus the wavelength curve in the 100 GHz transmitted channel bandwidth (Operating Wavelength Bandwidth)
7 PDL (Polarization Dependent Loss) is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum IL in the 100 GHz transmitted channel Bandwidth (Operating Wavelength Bandwidth) evaluated at all SOP, measured at a given wavelength.
8 PMD (Polarization Mode Dispersion) is defined as the maximum of the DGD versus the wavelength curve in the 100 GHz transmitted channel bandwidth (Operating Wavelength Bandwidth).
9 Mux Module: Attenuation = IL1 - IL2, where IL1 = Ch1-RX to MON-MUX Insertion Loss and IL2 = Ch1-RX to COM-TX Insertion Loss.
