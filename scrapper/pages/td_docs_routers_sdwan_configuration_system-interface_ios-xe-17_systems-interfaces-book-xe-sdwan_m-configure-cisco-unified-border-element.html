Information About CUBE
CUBE bridges voice and video connectivity between two VoIP networks. It is similar to a traditional voice gateway, except for the replacement of physical voice trunks with IP-based voice trunks. Traditional gateways connect VoIP networks to telephone companies by using a circuit-switched connection, such as PRI. CUBE connects VoIP networks to other VoIP networks and enterprise networks to Internet telephony service providers (ITSPs).
CUBE provides conventional Session Border Controller (SBC) functions and a wide variety advanced features.
You can configure Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices for CUBE by using device CLI templates or CLI add-on feature templates.
For more information about the CUBE setup, functionality, usage, configuration, and related topics, see the Cisco Unified Border Element Configuration Guide.

Use Cases for CUBE
CUBE can be used to configure session border controller elements for a wide variety of applications, including the following:
Enterprise premises-based collaboration capabilities using Cisco Unified Communications Manager (or another call control application) with centralized or local PSTN breakouts
A local breakout gateway for Cisco Unified Communications Manager Cloud, which is a Cisco-hosted cloud service for large enterprises
A local gateway to enable the Bring Your Own PSTN (BYoPSTN) option for Cisco Webex Calling
Edge audio for Cisco Webex meetings with a direct VoIP route to the Cisco Webex cloud or through existing PSTN services
Configure CUBE
To configure a device to use the CUBE functionality, create a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device CLI template or a CLI add-on feature template for the device.
For information about device CLI templates, see CLI Templates for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Device Routers.
For information about CLI add-on feature templates, see CLI Add-On Feature Templates.
For information about CUBE configuration and usage, see Cisco Unified Border Element Configuration Guide.
