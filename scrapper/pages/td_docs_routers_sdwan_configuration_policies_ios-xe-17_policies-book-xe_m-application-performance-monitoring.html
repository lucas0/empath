Overview of Application Performance Monitor
The Application Performance Monitor feature is a simplified framework that enables you to configure intent-based performance monitors. With this feature, you can view real-time, end-to-end application performance filtered by client segments, network segments, and server segments. This information helps you optimize application performance.
An application performance monitor is a predefined configuration that is used to collect performance metrics for specific traffic.
Key Concepts in Application Performance Monitoring
Monitoring Profile: A profile is a predefined set of traffic monitors that can be enabled or disabled for a context. As part of this feature, the sdwan-performance profile has been enhanced to include Application Response Time (ART) and media monitors to monitor traffic passing through Cisco SD-WAN tunnel interfaces. The sdwan-performance profile has a dedicated policy to filter traffic based on your intent.
When you choose the sdwan-performance profile, the related configuration is generated and applied automatically.
Context: A context represents a performance monitor policy map that is attached to an interface for ingress and egress traffic. A context contains information about a traffic monitor that has to be enabled. When a context is attached to an interface, two policy-maps are created, one each for ingress and egress traffic. Depending on the direction specified in the traffic monitor, the policy maps are attached in that direction and the traffic is monitored.

Note
A context can be attached to multiple interfaces. Only one context can be attached to an interface. You can modify the context only when it is not attached to an interface.
Traffic Monitoring Specifications: You can choose to filter performance metrics using classification and sampler.
Classification: Classification is a filter that defines the traffic that should be monitored for specified applications. This filter reduces the load on the device and performance collectors because they only need to monitor performance for specific applications.
Sampler: A sampler monitors random traffic flows, based on the sampling rate specified, rather than all the flows. Enabling the sampler reduces scaling and performance impact when the scale of traffic is large.
Features and Benefits
ART can be monitored for TCP flows. Some of the parameters that can be monitored areâ€”server network delay, client network delay, and application delay.
Jitter can be monitored for Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) audio and video traffic.
Information about input and output interfaces and local and remote TLOCs can be collected for every flow that matches the performance monitor.
Performance monitor can be configured on all WAN tunnel interfaces or specific WAN tunnel interfaces using CLI commands.
Global performance sampler is supported. The sampler allows you to monitor random flows based on the sampling rate configured, rather than the entire traffic, therefore, reducing performance and scaling overhead.
How Application Performance Monitor Works
Figure 1. Performance Monitoring Workflow
In this image, performance monitor has been applied globally (on all tunnel interfaces). You also have the option to enable it on specific interfaces. Performance is monitored for traffic going out of, and coming into the WAN tunnel interfaces. Based on the exporter parameters defined in the context that is initiated from the monitoring profile, the metrics that are collected are sent to the third-party collector that is defined. You can then view details of the application or media that you are monitoring using various show commands.
Limitations and Restrictions
Performance monitoring is only supported on IPv4 traffic. IPv6 traffic is not supported.
Once a performance monitor is applied to a device, the configuration cannot be modified and reapplied to the device. Follow these steps to make any modifications to performance monitor configuration:
Edit the CLI Add-on feature template or device CLI template to remove the performance monitor apply command from the template. Update the device CLI template or the device template to which the CLI Add-on feature template is attached.
Edit the performance monitor context in the CLI Add-on feature template, and apply the performance monitor again using the performance monitor apply command. Update the device template to which the CLI Add-on feature template is attached.
Alternatively, configure a new context based on the same monitoring profile, and remove the previous context configuration.
App visibility must be enabled in a policy to be able to set the connector initiator value appropriately.
Configure Application Performance Monitor
You can enable application performance monitor globally (on all WAN tunnel interfaces) or on specific WAN tunnel interfaces. You can also enable performance monitoring for ART, or media monitors, or both.
To configure application performance monitoring using Cisco vManage, create a CLI add-on feature template and attach it to the device template.
Enable Performance Monitor Globally
The following example shows how to configure a performance monitor context using the sdwan-performance profile. This configuration enables monitoring of traffic metrics for ART and media, and applies the configuration to all SD-WAN tunnel interfaces. Here, 10.0.1.128 is the IP address of the third-party collector, GigabitEthernet9 is the source interface, and 2055 is the listening port of the third-party collector.

Enable Performance Monitor on a Specific Interface
The following example shows how to configure a performance monitor context using the sdwan-performance profile. This configuration enables monitoring of traffic metrics for ART and media, and applies it to a specific tunel interface, in this case, Tunnel1. Here, 10.0.1.128 is the IP address of the third-party collector, GigabitEthernet9 is the source interface, and 2055 is the listening port of the third-party collector.

Specify Additional Monitoring Filters and Sampling Rate
The following example shows how to enable specific type of traffic to be monitored. In this case, the match protocol of rtp-audio is defined in the class map named match-audio. This class in then referenced in traffic-monitor media class-and match-audio so that rtp-audio traffic is specifically monitored. Alternatively, you can use the keyword class-and . In such a case, the customized class map replaces the default class map, which is automatically created when you enable the sdwan-performance profile.
In this example, performance monitor is applied globally, which means that it is applied on all SD-WAN tunnel interfaces. The sampling rate of 10 indicates that one in 10 flows is monitored. Sampling rate 100 indicates that one in 100 flows is monitored.
