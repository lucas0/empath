action (EEM)
To match a regular expression pattern on an input string, to specify the action of writing a message to syslog, and to specify the action of reloading the Cisco IOS software when an Embedded Event Manager (EEM) applet is triggered, use the action command in applet configuration mode. To disable this function, use the no form of this command.
action label { regexp string-submatch | | reload | | syslog msg msg-text | | wait wait-interval }
no action label
Syntax Description
label
Unique identifier that can be any string value. Actions are sorted and run in ascending alphanumeric key sequence using the label as the sort key. If the string contains embedded blanks, enclose it in double quotation marks.
string-submatch
(Optional) The variable name to store any submatches that are present. A maximum of three submatch strings can be specified.
msg
Specifies the message to be logged.
msg-text
Character text, an environment variable, or a combination of the two. If the string contains embedded blanks, enclose it in double quotation marks.
Note
  Messages written to syslog from an EEM applet are not screened for EEM syslog events, which may lead to recursive EEM syslog events. Messages sent from an EEM applet include the applet name for identification.
wait-interval
The wait interval range is from 1 to 31536000.
Command Default
No messages are written to syslog.
No reload of the Cisco IOS software is performed.
No regular expression patterns are matched.
