Introduction
This document describes the procedure to configure Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) with IPv6 for Admin Portal and CLI.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:
Identity Services Engine (ISE)
IPv6
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
ISE version 3.0 Patch 4.
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Background Information
In most cases, Cisco Identity Services Engine can be configured with an Ipv4 address to manage ISE through User interface (GUI) and CLI log in into Admin Portal, however, from ISE version 2.6 and above Cisco ISE can be managed over an IPv6 address, and configure an IPv6 address to Eth0 (Interface) when setup wizard as well as through CLI. When configured IPv6 address, it is recommended to have an IPv4 address configured (in addition to IPv6 address) for the Cisco ISE node communication. Hence, dual stack (combination of both IPv4 and IPv6) is required.
It is possible to configure Secure Socket Shell (SSH) with IPv6 addresses. Cisco ISE supports multiple IPv6 addresses on any interface and these IPv6 addresses can be configured and managed using CLI.

ISE Configuration
Note: By default, ipv6 address option is enable in all ISE interfaces. It is a best practice to disable this option if it is not planned to be used issue the no ipv6 address autoconfig and/or no ipv6 enable where applicable. Use the show run command to validate which interfaces have ipv6 enabled.
Note: The configuration considers cisco ISE is already configured with IPv4 addressing.
ems-ise-mnt001/admin# Configure terminal
ems-ise-mnt001/admin(config)# int GigabitEthernet 0
ems-ise-mnt001/admin(config-GigabitEthernet)# ipv6 address 2001:420:404a:133::66
% Changing the IP address might cause ise services to restart
Continue with IP address change?  Y/N [N]:Y
Note: Adding or changing IP addressing on an interface causes the services to restart
Step 2. Once services have been restarted issue the show application status ise command to validate the services are running:
ems-ise-mnt001/admin# show application status ise

Communication validation with use of ping for IPv6 Address on MacOS
Step 1. Open a terminal and use the ping6 <IPv6 Address> command to validate the communication response from ISE
M-65PH:~ ecanogut$ ping6 2001:420:404a:133::66
PING6(56=40+8+8 bytes) 2001:420:c0c4:1005::589 --> 2001:420:404a:133::66
16 bytes from 2001:420:404a:133::66, icmp_seq=0 hlim=51 time=229.774 ms
16 bytes from 2001:420:404a:133::66, icmp_seq=1 hlim=51 time=231.262 ms
16 bytes from 2001:420:404a:133::66, icmp_seq=2 hlim=51 time=230.545 ms
16 bytes from 2001:420:404a:133::66, icmp_seq=3 hlim=51 time=320.207 ms
16 bytes from 2001:420:404a:133::66, icmp_seq=4 hlim=51 time=236.246
Communication validation with use of ping for IPv6 Address on Windows
In order for the IPv6 ping command to work, Ipv6 needs to be enabled on the network configuration.
Step 1. Select Start > Settings > Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings.
Step 2. Validate Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6) is enabled, click on the checkbox in case this option is disable.
Step 3: Open a terminal and use ping <IPv6 Address> or ping -6 <ise_node_fqdn> command to validate the communication response from ISE
> ping 2001:420:404a:133::66
Communication validation with use of ping for IPv6 Address on Ping IPv6 In Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Mint, CentOS, RHEL).
Step 1. Open a terminal and use ping <IPv6 Address> or ping -6 <ise_node_fqdn> command to validate the communication response from ISE
$ ping 2001:420:404a:133::66
Communication validation with use of ping for IPv6 Address on Ping IPv6 In Cisco (IOS)
Note: Cisco provides the ping command in exec mode in order to check connectivity to the IPv6 targets. The ping command requires ipv6 parameter and the IPv6 address of the target.
Step 1. Log in into cisco IOS device in exec mode and issue the ping Ipv6 <IPv6 Address> command to validate the communication response from ISE
# ping ipv6 2001:420:404a:133::66
Note: In addition, you can also take pcaps from ISE to validate the income IPv6 Traffic
