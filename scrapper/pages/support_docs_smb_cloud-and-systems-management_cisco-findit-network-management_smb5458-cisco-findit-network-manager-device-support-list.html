Objective
The Cisco FindIT Network Management provides tools that help you easily monitor, manage, and configure your Cisco 100 to 500 Series network devices such as switches, routers, and wireless access points (WAPs) using your web browser. It also notifies you about device and Cisco Support notifications such as the availability of new firmware, device status, network settings updates, and any connected devices that are no longer under warranty or covered by a support contract.
The FindIT Network Management is a distributed application which is comprised of two separate components or interfaces: one or more Probes referred to as FindIT Network Probe and a single Manager called FindIT Network Manager.
An instance of FindIT Network Probe installed at each site in the network performs network discovery, and communicates directly with each Cisco device. In a single site network, you may choose to run a standalone instance of FindIT Network Probe. However, if your network comprises multiple sites, you may install FindIT Network Manager at a convenient location and associate each Probe with the Manager. From the Manager interface, you can get a high-level view of the status of all the sites in your network, and connect to the Probe installed at a particular site when you wish to view a detailed information for that site.
This article provides the list of products that make up the Cisco 100 to 500 Series portfolio that support the FindIT Network Manager. The features supported are primarily controlled by the management protocols supported by the device, and so may be dependent on the device firmware version.
The FindIT Network Manager functionality is divided into the following areas:
Discovery — Includes the ability to detect the device and display detailed information about the device.
Monitoring — Perform real time monitoring of the device through the Dashboard.
Operations — Firmware upgrade, configuration (save, backup, restore), device reboot.
Configuration — Includes functionality offered by the Device View, System Configuration and Network pages.
Reporting — Device is included in network reports.
