Objective
Executive reports are different reports that are being generated from the devices on the FindIT Network Probes linked to the FindIT Network Manager. Running these reports is one of the two optional steps that you can perform in the process flow of getting started with using the plugin.
This feature can be used to view a high-level dashboard displaying a summary of device status. The view may be filtered based on Kaseya Organizations or Groups. The report includes status charts and graphs that represent the devices that meet the specific conditions. You may click through the links to remediate the condition, or to view more detailed information.
It is quite helpful to get detailed information about devices on a network to help identify devices with alerts, what needs to be upgraded, if any have reached end of support, or if any are out of warranty. Executive reports categorize the devices on the basis of their current status.
This article aims to show you how to run various executive reports on the Cisco FindIT Kaseya Plugin.
