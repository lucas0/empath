Test Case II: L2TPv3 Xconnect over MPLS network with Endpoints in VRF
   Introduction
This document describes how the Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) can be used when you configure Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)v3 Xconnect over IP and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) network.
Background Information
L2TP is the tunneling protocol used by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in order to provide Virtual Private Network (VPN) in the dial access space over the internet. 
It combines the best of Cisco's Layer 2 Forwarding (L2F) protocol and Microsoft's Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP). The main components of L2TP are L2TP Access Controller (LAC) and L2TP Network Server (LNS).
L2TP Access Controller: LAC is an access server connected to Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). The LAC is the initiator of incoming calls and the receiver of outgoing calls. It is connected to LNS over LAN or WAN.
L2TP Network Server: LNS is the network server for L2TP protcol where PPP sessions terminate and are authenticated. The LNS is the initiator of outgoing calls and the receiver of incoming calls.
L2TPv2 was designed to carry PPP traffic over IP networks. Network access equipment (DSL, cable modem or dial-up access interfaces) accepted PPP connections from subscribers and tunnelled the PPP sessions to the ISP over L2TP. The new version L2TPv3 is designed to carry any Layer 2 payload in addition to PPP which was the only payload that was supported by version 2.  Specifically, L2TPv3 defines the L2TP protocol for tunneling Layer 2 payloads over an IP core network with the use Layer 2 VPNs. Benefits of this feature include this:
L2TPv3 simplifies deployment of VPNs
L2TPv3 does not require MPLS
L2TPv3 supports Layer 2 tunneling over IP for any payload
Here is the sample configuration of L2TPv3 pseudowire:
1.enable
2.configureterminal
3.interface type slot/port
4.xconnectpeer-ip-address vcidencapsulation l2tpv3pw-classpw-class-name
Now take a look at how L2TPv3 Xconnect behaves when VRF is used. Here is the topology that is used for demonstration in which we Xconnect is configured between CPE and ASR1002 (IP) and ASR1004 (MPLS) with endpoints at ASR1000 in VRF (VRF Aware L2TPv3 is not supported on ASR1000 platform).
Test Case I: L2TPv3 Xconnect over IP network with Endpoints in VRF
PE-1 and PE-2 make the MPLS network for ISP. CPE is connected to PE-1 over VRF and ASR1002 is connected to PE-2 over VRF. ASR1002 also has VRF on the interface connected to PE-2. The reachability of CPE loopback from ASR1002 is via VRF over IP interface.

     It says Segment 2 is down, which means the path from CPE to ASR1002 is having an issue. However, we are able to ping the Endpoint. The debugs on CPE shows that tunnel to Endpoint is failed or there is no route to endpoint.

The main issue here is that Endpoint is reachable via VRF on ASR1002. The Xconnect endpoint needs to be in Global Routing Table for it to come up. Let us now configure a route for CPE Loopback 1.1.1.1/32 in global pointing to interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0.906 which is itself in VRF. 
 ip route 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.255 GigabitEthernet0/0/0.906 10.1.1.2



              S        1.1.1.1/32 [1/0] via 10.1.1.2, GigabitEthernet0/0/0.906
Once the dummy static route is configured, Xconnect comes up. You can also point it to Null0. This is a workaround to let the router believe that Endpoint is reachable via Global not VRF and is just used for Control Plane. The actual data plane traffic will be via VRF only. 
Here are the ping results with and without VRF:
ASR1002 #ping 1.1.1.1

Type escape sequence to abort.

Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 1.1.1.1, timeout is 2 seconds:

Test Case II: L2TPv3 Xconnect over MPLS network with Endpoints in VRF
PE-1, PE-2 and PE-3 make the MPLS network for ISP with PE-2 acting as Route Reflector (RR). CPE is connected to PE-1 over VRF and ASR1004 is connected to PE-2 with MPLS enabled on the interface. ASR1004 also has VRF in which it is supposed to receive the VPNv4 routes from PE-1 via RR. The reachability of CPE looback from ASR1004 is via VRF over MPLS interface.

You cannot configure a static route in this case as exit interface is MPLS enabled interface.  As a workaround, there are two interfaces looped back to each other and configured one in VRF with other in global. Then configured a static route in global pointing towards VRF interface, with this Xconnect became stable.

The traffic flow is seen as in case of ASR1004:
When traffic comes from CPE on ASR1004, it comes in MPLS interface Gi0/0/1 and gets switched directly to Gi0/0/0 Access port.
When traffic comes from Access Port Gi0/0/0, it takes the looped path of Gi0/0/0 -> Gi0/0/2 -> Gi0/0/3 -> Gi0/0/1.
The main issue with this workaround is for QFP utilization on ASR1000 platform as packet processing is done twice:
