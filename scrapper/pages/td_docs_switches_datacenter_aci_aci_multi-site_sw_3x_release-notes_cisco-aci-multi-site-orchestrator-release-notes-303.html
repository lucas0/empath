Cisco ACI Multi-Site Orchestrator Release Notes, Release 3.0(3)
This document describes the features, issues, and deployment guidelines for the Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) Multi-Site Orchestrator software.
Cisco ACI Multi-Site is an architecture that allows you to interconnect separate Cisco APIC cluster domains (fabrics), each representing a different region. This helps ensure multitenant Layer 2 and Layer 3 network connectivity across sites and extends the policy domain end-to-end across the entire system.
Cisco ACI Multi-Site Orchestrator is the intersite policy manager. It provides single-pane management that enables you to monitor the health of all the interconnected sites. It also allows you to centrally define the intersite policies that can then be pushed to the different Cisco APIC fabrics, which in term deploys them on the physical switches that make up those fabrics. This provides a high degree of control over when and where to deploy those policies.

New Software Features
This release adds the following new features:
Feature
Description
Support for Intersite L3Out with Policy Based Redirect (PBR)
This capability enables endpoints in site 1 to use PBR policy with site 2 L3Out for WAN connectivity (intersite L3Out). For example, if each site has its firewall cluster and L3Out, if one of the site’s L3Out goes down, the application EPG endpoints in that site can use the other site’s L3Out for WAN connectivity.
For more information, see Cisco ACI Multi-Site Configuration Guide, Release 3.0(x).
New Hardware Features
There is no new hardware supported in this release.
The complete list of supported hardware is available in the Cisco ACI Multi-Site Hardware Requirements Guide.
Changes in Behavior
If you are upgrading to this release, you will see the following changes in behavior:
■      For all new deployments, we recommend installing Multi-Site Orchestrator, Release 3.0(2j) or later in Application Services Engine.
■      If your Multi-Site Orchestrator is deployed in Application Services Engine and you are upgrading from Release 3.0(1) or earlier, you must deploy a new Application Services Engine, Release 1.1.3d cluster and migrate your existing configuration.
The procedure is described in detail in Cisco ACI Multi-Site Orchestrator Installation and Upgrade Guide.
■      Any shadow objects created by the Multi-Site Orchestrator will now be automatically hidden in each site’s APIC GUI if that site is running Cisco APIC, Release 5.0(2) or later. You can choose to disable this feature in the APIC GUI if you want the objects to be visible.
■      Simultaneous updates to Sites, Tenants, and Schemas from multiple Multi-Site Orchestrator GUI sessions will no longer cause some changes to be overwritten or lost. However, the default REST API functionality was left unchanged in order to preserve backward compatibility with existing applications. In other words, while the UI is always enabled for this protection, you must explicitly enable it for your UPDATE and DELETE API calls for MSO to keep track of configuration changes, as described in the Cisco ACI Multi-Site REST API Configuration Guide.
■      Starting with Release 2.2(3), additional External EPG subnet flags have been exposed through the Multi-Site Orchestrator GUI.
Prior to Release 2.2(3), only the following subset of external EPG subnet flags available on each site’s APIC was managed by the Multi-Site Orchestrator:
—     Shared Route Control—configurable in the Orchestrator GUI
—     Shared Security Import—configurable in the Orchestrator GUI
—     Aggregate Shared Routes—configurable in the Orchestrator GUI
—     External Subnets for External EPG—not configurable in the GUI, but always implicitly enabled
Starting with Release 2.2(3), all subnet flags available from the APIC can be configured and managed from the Orchestrator:
—     Export Route Control
—     Import Route Control
—     Shared Route Control
—     Aggregate Shared Routes
—     Aggregate Export (enabled for 0.0.0.0 subnet only)
—     Aggregate Import (enabled for 0.0.0.0 subnet only)
—     External Subnets for External EPG
—     Shared Security Import
When upgrading to this release from Release 2.2(2) or earlier, any subnet flags previously unavailable in the Orchestrator GUI will be imported from the APIC and added to the Orchestrator configuration. All imported flags will retain their state (enabled or disabled) with the exception of External Subnets for External EPG, which will remain enabled post-upgrade. If you had previously explicitly disabled the External Subnets for External EPG flag directly in the APIC (for example, in Cloud APIC use case) you will need to disable it again through the Orchestrator GUI.
When downgrading from this release to Release 2.2(2) or earlier, the subnet flags not available in those releases will be cleared and set to disabled in the sites’ APICs. You can then manually enable them directly in each site’s APIC if necessary.
For additional information on these flags, see the Cisco ACI Multi-Site Configuration Guide.
■      When upgrading from a release prior to Release 2.2(1), a GUI lockout timer for repeated failed login attempts is automatically enabled by default and is set to 5 login attempts before a lockout with the lockout duration incremented exponentially every additional failed attempt.
■      If you configure read-only user roles in Release 2.1(2) or later and then choose to downgrade your Multi-Site Orchestrator to an earlier version where the read-only roles are not supported:
—     You will need to reconfigure your external authentication servers to the old attribute-value (AV) pair string format. For details, see the "Administrative Operations" chapter in the Cisco ACI Multi-Site Configuration Guide.
—     The read-only roles will be removed from all users. This also means that any user that has only the read-only roles will have no roles assigned to them and a Power User or User Manager will need to re-assign them new read-write roles.
■      Starting with Release 2.1(2), the 'phone number' field is no longer mandatory when creating a new Multi-Site Orchestrator user. However, because the field was required in prior releases, any user created in Release 2.1(2) or later without a phone number provided will be unable to log into the GUI if the Orchestrator is downgraded to Release 2.1(1) or earlier. In this case, a Power User or User Manager will need to provide a phone number for the user.
■      If you are upgrading from any release prior to Release 2.1(1), the default password and the minimum password requirements for the Multi-Site Orchestrator GUI have been updated. The default password has been changed from ‘We1come!” to “We1come2msc!” and the new password requirements are:
—     At least 12 characters
—     At least 1 letter
—     At least 1 number
—     At least 1 special character apart from * and space
You will be prompted to reset your passwords when you:
—     First install Release 2.1(1) or later
—     Upgrade to Release 2.1(1) or later from a release prior to Release 2.1(1)
—     Restore the Multi-Site Orchestrator configuration from a backup
■      Starting with Release 2.1(1), Multi-Site Orchestrator encrypts all stored passwords, such as each site’s APIC passwords and the external authentication provider passwords. As a result, if you downgrade to any release prior to Release 2.1(1), you will need to re-enter all the passwords after the Orchestrator downgrade is completed.
To update APIC passwords:
a.     Log in to the Orchestrator after the downgrade.
b.     From the main navigation menu, select Sites.
c.     For each site, edit its properties and re-enter its APIC password.
To update external authentication passwords:
a.     Log in to the Orchestrator after the downgrade.
b.     From the navigation menu, select Admin à Providers.
c.     For each authentication provider, edit its properties and re-enter its password.

For Cisco ACI Multi-Site, Fabric IDs Must be the Same for All Sites, or the Querier IP address Must be Higher on One Site.
The Cisco APIC fabric querier functions have a distributed architecture, where each leaf switch acts as a querier, and packets are flooded. A copy is also replicated to the fabric port. There is an Access Control List (ACL) configured on each TOR to drop this query packet coming from the fabric port. If the source MAC address is the fabric MAC address, unique per fabric, then the MAC address is derived from the fabric-id. The fabric ID is configured by users during initial bring up of a pod site.
In the Cisco ACI Multi-Site Stretched BD with Layer 2 Broadcast Extension use case, the query packets from each TOR get to the other sites and should be dropped. If the fabric-id is configured differently on the sites, it is not possible to drop them.
To avoid this, configure the fabric IDs the same on each site, or the querier IP address on one of the sites should be higher than on the other sites.
CSCvd61787
STP and "Flood in Encapsulation" Option are not Supported with Cisco ACI Multi-Site.
In Cisco ACI Multi-Site topologies, regardless of whether EPGs are stretched between sites or localized, STP packets do not reach remote sites. Similarly, the "Flood in Encapsulation" option is not supported across sites. In both cases, packets are encapsulated using an FD VNID (fab-encap) of the access VLAN on the ingress TOR. It is a known issue that there is no capability to translate these IDs on the remote sites.
CSCvi61260
If an infra L3Out that is being managed by Cisco ACI Multi-Site is modified locally in a Cisco APIC, Cisco ACI Multi-Site might delete the objects not managed by Cisco ACI Multi-Site in an L3Out.
CSCvq07769
"Phone Number" field is required in all releases prior to Release 2.2(1). Users with no phone number specified in Release 2.2(1) or later will not be able to log in to the GUI when Orchestrator is downgraded to a an earlier release.
Usage Guidelines
This section lists usage guidelines for the Cisco ACI Multi-Site software.
■      For all new deployments, we recommend installing Multi-Site Orchestrator, Release 3.0(2j) or later in Application Services Engine.
Multi-Site Orchestrator, Release 3.0(2j) requires Application Services Engine, Release 1.1.3d.
■      In Cisco ACI Multi-Site topologies, we recommend that First Hop Routing protocols such as HSRP/VRRP are not stretched across sites.
■      HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS and there is no HTTP support globally or per user basis.
■      Up to 12 interconnected sites are supported.
■      Proxy ARP glean and unknown unicast flooding are not supported together.
Unknown Unicast Flooding and ARP Glean are not supported together in Cisco ACI Multi-Site across sites.
■      Flood in encapsulation is not supported for EPGs and Bridge Domains that are extended across ACI fabrics that are part of the same Multi-Site domain. However, flood in encapsulation is fully supported for EPGs or Bridge Domains that are locally defined in ACI fabrics, even if those fabrics may be configured for Multi-Site.
■      The leaf and spine nodes that are part of an ACI fabric do not run Spanning Tree Protocol (STP). STP frames originated from external devices can be forwarded across an ACI fabric (both single Pod and Multi-Pod), but are not forwarded across the inter-site network between sites, even if stretching a BD with BUM traffic enabled.
■      GOLF L3Outs for each tenant must be dedicated, not shared.
The inter-site L3Out functionality introduced on MSO release 2.2(1) does not apply when deploying GOLF L3Outs. This means that for a given VRF there is still the requirement of deploying at least one GOLF L3Out per site in order to enable north-south communication. An endpoint connected in a site cannot communicate with resources reachable via a GOLF L3Out connection deployed in a different site.
■      While you can create the L3Out objects in the Multi-Site Orchestrator GUI, the physical L3Out configuration (logical nodes, logical interfaces, and so on) must be done directly in each site's APIC.
■      VMM and physical domains must be configured in the Cisco APIC GUI at the site and will be imported and associated within the Cisco ACI Multi-Site.
Although domains (VMM and physical) must be configured in Cisco APIC, domain associations can be configured in the Cisco APIC or Cisco ACI Multi-Site.
■      Some VMM domain options must be configured in the Cisco APIC GUI.
The following VMM domain options must be configured in the Cisco APIC GUI at the site:
—     NetFlow/EPG CoS marking in a VMM domain association
—     Encapsulation mode for an AVS VMM domain
■      Some uSeg EPG attribute options must be configured in the Cisco APIC GUI.
The following uSeg EPG attribute options must be configured in the Cisco APIC GUI at the site:
—     Sub-criteria under uSeg attributes
—     match-all and match-any criteria under uSeg attributes
■      Site IDs must be unique.
In Cisco ACI Multi-Site, site IDs must be unique.
■      To change a Cisco APIC fabric ID, you must erase and reconfigure the fabric.
Cisco APIC fabric IDs cannot be changed. To change a Cisco APIC fabric ID, you must erase the fabric configuration and reconfigure it.
However, Cisco ACI Multi-Site supports connecting multiple fabrics with the same fabric ID.
■      Caution: When removing a spine switch port from the Cisco ACI Multi-Site infrastructure, perform the following steps:
a.     Click Sites.
b.     Click Configure Infra.
c.     Click the site where the spine switch is located.
d.     Click the spine switch.
e.     Click the x on the port details.
f.      Click Apply.
■      Shared services use case: order of importing tenant policies
When deploying a provider site group and a consumer site group for shared services by importing tenant policies, deploy the provider tenant policies before deploying the consumer tenant policies. This enables the relation of the consumer tenant to the provider tenant to be properly formed.
■      Caution for shared services use case when importing a tenant and stretching it to other sites
When you import the policies for a consumer tenant and deploy them to multiple sites, including the site where they originated, a new contract is deployed with the same name (different because it is modified by the inter-site relation). To avoid confusion, delete the original contract with the same name on the local site. In the Cisco APIC GUI, the original contract can be distinguished from the contract that is managed by Cisco ACI Multi-Site, because it is not marked with a cloud icon.
■      When a contract is established between EPGs in different sites, each EPG and its bridge domain (BD) are mirrored to and appear to be deployed in the other site, while only being actually deployed in its own site. These mirrored objects are known as "shadow” EPGs and BDs.
For example, if one EPG in Site 1 and another EPG in Site 2 have a contract between them, in the Cisco APIC GUI at Site 1 and Site 2, both EPGs will be present. They appear with the same names as the ones that were deployed directly to each site. This is expected behavior and the shadow objects must not be removed. In Cisco APIC releases prior to Release 5.0(2), these objects are always visible. Starting with Cisco APIC, Release 5.0(2), these shadow objects are automatically hidden from view, but are still present in the configuration; you can choose to show these objects by enabling a user setting in each site’s APIC GUI.
For more information, see the Schema Management chapter in the Cisco ACI Multi-Site Configuration Guide.
■      Inter-site traffic cannot transit sites.
Site traffic cannot transit sites on the way to another site. For example, when Site 1 routes traffic to Site 3, it cannot be forwarded through Site 2.
■      The ? icon in Cisco ACI Multi-Site opens the menu for Show Me How modules, which provide step-by-step help through specific configurations.
—     If you deviate while in progress of a Show Me How module, you will no longer be able to continue.
—     You must have IPv4 enabled to use the Show Me How modules.
■      User passwords must meet the following criteria:
—     Minimum length is 8 characters

Compatibility
This release supports the hardware listed in the Cisco ACI Multi-Site Hardware Requirements Guide.
Multi-Site Orchestrator releases have been decoupled from the APIC releases. The APIC clusters in each site as well as the Orchestrator itself can now be upgraded independently of each other and run in mixed operation mode. For more information, see the Interoperability Support section in the  “Infrastructure Management” chapter of the Cisco ACI Multi-Site Orchestrator Installation and Upgrade Guide.
Scalability
For the verified scalability limits, see the Cisco ACI Verified Scalability Guide.
