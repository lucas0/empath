Product Architecture
Cisco VSG is designed using advanced networking concepts such as control and data-path splitting to provide efficiency, availability, and high performance while securing virtualized environments. Operating in conjunction with Cisco Nexus 1000V Switches, which are distributed virtual switches, in the VMware vSphere hypervisor and Microsoft Hyper-V, Cisco VSG uses the Cisco vPath technology embedded in the Cisco Nexus 1000V Virtual Ethernet Module (VEM), as shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2.      Cisco VSG Deployment Topology
Cisco vPath technology steers traffic, whether inbound or traveling from virtual machine to virtual machine, to the designated Cisco VSGs. A split-processing model is applied in which initial packet processing occurs in the Cisco VSG for policy evaluation and enforcement. Subsequent policy enforcement for packets is offloaded directly to Cisco vPath. Cisco vPath provides:
●   Intelligent traffic steering: Flow classification and redirection to associated Cisco VSGs
●   Fast path offload: Policy enforcement of flows offloaded by Cisco VSG to Cisco vPath
●   Service chaining: Insertion of Cisco VSG along with other network services in the traffic path
Cisco vPath is designed for multitenancy, providing traffic steering and fast path offload on a per-tenant basis.
Together, the Cisco VSG and Cisco Nexus 1000V VEM provide the following deployment benefits:
●   Efficient deployment: Each Cisco VSG can provide protection across multiple physical servers, eliminating the need to deploy one virtual appliance per physical server.
●   High performance: By offloading enforcement to Cisco Nexus 1000V VEM vPath modules, Cisco VSG architecture boosts performance.
●   Operational simplicity: Cisco VSG can be transparently inserted in one-arm mode without the need to create multiple switches or to temporarily migrate virtual machines to different switches or servers. Zone scaling is based on security profiles, not on virtual network interface cards (vNICs), which are limited for virtual appliances. These features simplify physical server upgrades without compromising security or incurring application outages.
●   High availability: Cisco VSG can be deployed in active-standby mode to help ensure a highly available operating environment, with Cisco vPath redirecting packets to the standby Cisco VSG if the active Cisco VSG becomes unavailable.
●   Independent capacity planning: Cisco VSG can be placed on a dedicated server controlled by the security operations team so that appropriate computing capacity can be allocated to application workloads; capacity planning can occur independently across server and security teams; and operation segregation can be maintained across security, network, and server teams.
Trusted Access
Cisco VSG allows IT departments to segment their data center and cloud environments with strong security boundaries. Multiple instances of Cisco VSG can secure entire data centers or divide lines of business or tenants, allowing large-scale deployments. Security segments are isolated, and traffic cannot cross segment boundaries. Cisco VSG can be deployed at the line-of-business or tenant level, at the virtual data center (vDC) level, or at the virtual application (vApp) level.
As virtual machines are instantiated for trust zones, their security profiles and zone memberships are assigned immediately through binding with Cisco Nexus 1000V port profiles, as shown in Figure 2. A security profile contains context-aware rule sets that specify access policies for traffic entering and exiting each zone. In addition to defining virtual machine and network contexts, custom attributes provide a flexible and extensible way to define trust zones. Controls are applied to zone-to-zone traffic as well as to external area-to-zone (and zone-to-external area) traffic. Zone-based enforcement also can occur within a VLAN, because a VLAN often identifies a segment or tenant boundary. Cisco VSG evaluates access control rules and subsequently offloads enforcement to the Cisco Nexus 1000V VEM vPath for performance acceleration. Enforcement can trigger permit or deny actions and optional access logs. Cisco VSG also provides policy-based traffic monitoring capabilities with access logs.
The traffic steering intelligence of Cisco vPath offers an efficient deployment model in that a Cisco VSG can protect virtual machines in a zone spanning multiple hypervisors. Overlapping (private) IP address space can be allocated per line of business or tenant, an important consideration in multitenant cloud environments. Cisco VSG management and deployment of associated security policies are performed in the Cisco Prime™ Network Services Controller (Cisco NSC; formerly known as the Cisco Virtual Network Management Center [VNMC]), described later in this document.
Dynamic (Virtualization-Aware) Operation
Virtualization can be highly dynamic, with frequent add, delete, and change operations on virtual machines. Live migration of virtual machines occurs through manual or programmed VMware vMotion and Microsoft Hyper-V Live Migration. Figure 3 shows how a structured deployment such as the one in Figure 2 can change over time as a result of this dynamic virtual machine environment.
Cisco VSG operating in conjunction with the Cisco Nexus 1000V (and vPath) supports dynamic virtualization. Trust zones and associated security profiles for each line of business or tenant are created with Cisco VSG, and the Cisco Prime NSC security profiles are bound to Cisco Nexus 1000V port profiles authored on the Cisco Nexus 1000V Virtual Supervisor Module (VSM) and published to VMware vCenter and Microsoft Hyper-V System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM). When a new virtual machine is instantiated, the server administrator assigns the appropriate port profile to the virtual machine's virtual Ethernet port. The port and security profiles and the virtual machine's zone membership are immediately applied. A virtual machine can be repurposed simply by assigning different port and security profiles.
VMware vMotion and Microsoft Hyper-V Live Migration events trigger movement of virtual machines across physical servers. The Cisco Nexus 1000V helps ensure that port and security profiles both follow the virtual machine. Security enforcement and monitoring remain in place regardless of VMware vMotion and Microsoft Hyper-V Live Migration events.
Figure 3.      Cisco VSG Provides Security Even in Dynamic Virtual Machine Environments, Including Virtual Machine Live Migration
Nondisruptive Administration
The Cisco VSG solution offers a nondisruptive administration model, allowing IT security, network, and server teams to collaborate while helping ensure administrative segregation to meet compliance and audit requirements and reduce administrative errors. The Cisco Prime NSC and Cisco Nexus 1000V VSM deliver the nondisruptive administration model (Figure 4).
●   Security administrators can author and manage security profiles as well as manage Cisco VSG instances; security profiles are referenced in Cisco Nexus 1000V port profiles.
●   Network administrators can author and manage port profiles as well as manage Cisco Nexus 1000V distributed virtual switches. Port profiles are referenced in VMware vCenter and Microsoft Hyper-V SCVMM through the programmatic interface of the Cisco Nexus 1000V VSM.
●   Server administrators can select the appropriate port profile in VMware vCenter and Microsoft Hyper-V SCVMM when instantiating a virtual machine.
Additionally, third-party management and orchestration tools can interact programmatically, through XML APIs, with Cisco Prime NSC for automated management and provisioning of Cisco VSG.

Deployment Considerations
To support different use cases across lines of business or tenants, vDCs, and vApps, Cisco VSG provides a highly flexible and simple deployment model. Each line of business or tenant can include multiple virtual machine zones, vDCs, and vApps. A vDC can also contain multiple virtual machine zones and vApps. Figure 5 illustrates several such deployment scenarios. For example, a line-of-business or tenant Cisco VSG can be deployed to protect the virtual machine zones, vDCs, and vApps of segment 1; for segment 2, Cisco VSG can be deployed on a per-vDC basis; and for segment 3 Cisco VSG can be deployed on a per-vApp basis.
