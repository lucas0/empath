The Catalyst 6000 family eight and 16 port Gigabit Ethernet modules are Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standards compliant, and support full duplex operation.
The eight port modules can be configured with Short-Wave (SX), Longwave/Long-Haul (LX/LH), and Extended Range (ZX) GBICs. All Gigabit Ethernet ports on these modules have SC-type connectors for Multi-Mode Fiber (MMF) or Single-Mode Fiber (SMF).
The 16 port Gigabit Ethernet modules are available in a variety of interfaces: small form factor MT-RJ connectors, SX, LX/LH, and ZX GBICs, and RJ-45 connectors for Category 5, 5e, or 6 copper cabling.
1000Base-T copper GBICs with RJ-45 connectors(part number WS-G5483) are supported for the Catalyst 6000 series as of CatOS Relase 7.2 or later. For a complete list of 1000 Base-T supported switches and the minimum IOS release required, please consult the Cisco Gigabit Ethernet Transceiver Modules Compatibility Matrix.
Catalyst 6000 series switches support 10/100/1000BASE-T Ethernet Modules as of Catalyst OS 6.2(2) and Integrated Cisco IOS(Native Mode) release 12.1(8a)EX.
Catalyst 6500 series switches using the supervisor 720 can use either Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP) modules, or 1000Base-T copper built in uplink ports. For more information on installing and using the (SFP) modules, consult the Catalyst 6500 Transceivers, Module Connectors, and Cables Specifications guide.
Coarse Wave Division Multiplexing (CWDM) GBIC modules for fiber-optic connections are supported on the Catalyst 6500/0000 series switches from Cisco CatOS version 7.2(1) or later, or Cisco IOS code version 12.1(13)E1 or later.
