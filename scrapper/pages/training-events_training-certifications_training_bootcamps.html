Customer testimonials
“The Cisco Training Bootcamp made a big difference in my daily responsibilities because I could save time while automating certain tasks. I really liked the focused, relevant labs. But I think the biggest benefit was the way the Bootcamp helped me and my team optimize the way we rolled out and deployed our new infrastructure.”
