Introduction
This document describes a configuration example for integrating Duo SAML SSO with Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client access that leverages Cisco ISE for a detailed posture assessment. Duo SAML SSO is implemented using Duo Access Gateway (DAG) which communicates to the Active Directory for initial user authentication and then communicates to Duo Security (Cloud) for multi-factor authentication. Cisco ISE is used as an authorization server for providing endpoint verification using posture assessment.

Contributed by Dinesh Moudgil and Pulkit Saxena, Cisco HTTS Engineer.

Prerequisites
Requirements
This document assumes that the ASA is fully operational and configured to allow the Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) or Command Line Interface (CLI) to make configuration changes.
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:
    Fundamentals of Duo Access Gateway and Duo Security 
    Basic knowledge of remote access VPN configuration on the ASA
    Basic knowledge of ISE and posture services

Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software versions:
Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.12(3)12
Duo Access Gateway
Duo Security 
Cisco Identity Services Engine version 2.6 and later
Microsoft Windows 10 with AnyConnect Version 4.8.03052

Note: Anyconnect Embedded Browser, used in this implementation, requires ASA on 9.7(1)24, 9.8(2)28, 9.9(2)1 or higher version of each release, and AnyConnect version 4.6 or later.
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.

Traffic Flow
Anyconnect client initiates an SSL VPN connection to Cisco ASA

Cisco ASA, configured for primary authentication with Duo Access Gateway (DAG), redirects the embedded browser in Anyconnect client to DAG for SAML authentication

Anyconnect client is redirected to Duo Access Gateway

Once the AnyConnect client enters the credentials, a SAML authentication request is built and is issued from Cisco ASA to Duo Access Gateway

Duo Access Gateway leverages the integration with on-site active directory to perform primary authentication for the Anyconnect client

Once the primary authentication is successful, Duo Access Gateway sends a request to Duo Security over TCP port 443 to begin two-factor authentication

The AnyConnect client has presented with "Duo Interactive Prompt" and the user completes Duo two-factor authentication using their preferred method (push or passcode)

Duo Security receives an authentication response and returns the information to the Duo Access Gateway

Based on the authentication response, Duo Access Gateway builds a SAML authentication response which contains SAML assertion and responds to the Anyconnect client

Anyconnect client successfully authenticates for SSL VPN connection with Cisco ASA

Once the authentication is successful, Cisco ASA sends an authorization request to Cisco ISE
Note: Cisco ISE is configured only for authorization since Duo Access Gateway provides the necessary authentication
Cisco ISE processes the authorization request and since the client posture status is Unknown, returns Posture redirect with limited access to Anyconnect client via Cisco ASA

If Anyconnect client doesn't have a compliance module, it is prompted to download it to proceed further with posture assessment

If Anyconnect client has a compliance module, it establishes a TLS connection with Cisco ASA and posture flow starts

Depending on the posture conditions configured on ISE, posture checks are done and details are sent from Anyconnect client to Cisco ISE

If the client posture status changes from Unknown to Compliant, change of authorization (CoA) request is sent from Cisco ISE to Cisco ASA to grant full access to the client and VPN is fully established

Configurations

- Duo Admin Portal Configuration
In this section, configure the ASA application on the Duo Admin Portal.
1. Login to “Duo Admin Portal” and navigate to “Applications > Protect an Application”, and search for “ASA” with protection type of “2FA with Duo Access Gateway, self-hosted”. Click “Protect” on the far right to configure the Cisco ASA

To verify if authorization was successfully performed on ISE, navigate to "Operations > RADIUS > Live Logs"

This section exhibits the relevant information associated to the authorized user i.e. identity, authorization profile, authorization policy, and posture status.
Note: For additional posture validation on ISE, please refer to the following documentation:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/identity-services-engine/215236-ise-posture-over-anyconnect-remote-acces.html#anc7

To verify the authentication status on Duo Admin Portal, click on the "Reports" on the left side of the Admin Panel that shows the Authentication Log.

User Experience



Troubleshoot
This section provides the information you can use in order to troubleshoot your configuration.
Note: Refer to Important Information on Debug Commands before you use debug commands.
Caution: On the ASA, you can set various debug levels; by default, level 1 is used. If you change the debug level, the verbosity of the debugs might increase. Do this with caution, especially in production environments.
Most SAML troubleshooting will involve a misconfiguration that can be found through checking the SAML configuration or running debugs.

"debug webvpn saml 255" can be used to troubleshoot most issues, however in scenarios where this debug does not provide useful information, additional debugs can be run:

debug webvpn 255
debug webvpn anyconnect 255
debug webvpn session 255
debug webvpn request 255 

To troubleshoot authentication and authorization issues on ASA, use the following debug commands:

debug radius all
debug aaa authentication
debug aaa authorization To troubleshoot Posture related issues on ISE, set the following attributes to debug level: 

posture (ise-psc.log)
portal (guest.log)
provisioning (ise-psc.log)
runtime-AAA (prrt-server.log)
nsf (ise-psc.log)
nsf-session (ise-psc.log)
swiss (ise-psc.log)
Note: For detailed posture flow and troubleshooting AnyConnect and ISE, refer to the following link:
ISE Posture Style Comparison for Pre and Post 2.2
