Creating Google Cloud User Tenant
Before you begin
You must make certain configurations in Google Cloud before creating a Google Cloud user tenant in the Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator:
For either a managed or an unmanaged tenant, you must first set up a project in Google Cloud. See Setting Up the Google Cloud Project for a User Tenant for those instructions.
For an unmanaged tenant, you must then generate the necessary private key information and download the JSON file from Google Cloud. See Generating and Downloading Private Key Information from Google Cloud for an Unmanaged Tenant.
Procedure
Step 1
Log in to your Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator.
Step 2
In the left navigation menu, choose "Tenants".
Step 3
Choose "Add Tenant".
Step 4
Under General, provide a tenant name and an optional description.
The tenant name must be in the following format:
[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?
This means that the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all the following characters can be hyphens, lowercase letters, or digits, except the last character, which cannot be a hyphen.
Step 5
From the Associated Sites area, choose the Google Cloud site where you want to create the tenant.
Step 6
After selecting your Google Cloud site, click on the edit icon to specify your account information.

Configuring an Application Profile and EPG
Adding Cloud Endpoint Selector
Applying contract between the cloud EPGs
This section describes how to apply a contract to allow communication between the endpoints with in your cloud site. One thing to keep in mind regarding Google Cloud contracts is that the contracts should be deployed bi-directionally for bi-directional traffic.
Before you begin
You must have multiple cloud EPGs Creating Cloud EPGs already configured in your cloud site.
Procedure
Step 1
In the Main menu, select Application Management > Schemas.
Step 2
Create a contract and assign it to the cloud EPG.
Select the schema and the template that contains your existing cloud EPG.
Create the contract you will use for this use case.
If you already have an existing contract you want to apply for communication between the Cloud EPGs, you can skip this step.
Otherwise, create a contract and the required filters as you typically would for any inter-EPG communication in Cisco ACI fabrics.
Assign the contract to the cloud EPG.
You can decide which of the two EPGs will be the provider and which will be the consumer based on your specific use case.
Step 3
Select the other EPG.
From the right property side bar , choose Add contract.
In the contract window, select which contract you want to assign.
Select the same contract you assigned in previous step.
Click Save
Step 4
Deploy the templates.
