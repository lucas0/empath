Introduction
Voicemail is one of the most common features in IP Telephony. The Cisco IP Phone 6800, 7800, or 8800 Series Multiplatform Phone has voicemail storage capabilities.
The phones referenced in this article are not Enterprise phones that use a specific call controller. If you would like to compare the two different types of phones, check out Compare & Contrast: Cisco IP MPP Phones & Cisco Unified IP Phones.
Phones with Multiplatform Firmware
MPP phones require either service from an Internet Telephony Service Provider (ITSP) or an IP Private Branch Exchange (PBX) call control server. WebEx Calling, Ring Central, and Verizon are examples of an ITSP. Some examples of IP PBX services that work with Cisco MPP phones include, Asterisk, Centile, and Metaswitch platforms.
These ITSP and IP PBX call controllers are a separate system in which the phone and the call controller communicate with each other to provide services such as call park and voicemail. Since the MPP phones do not use a specific call controller, access and procedures vary.
Each call controller can follow different procedures, so we can't tell you exactly how yours will work. For information and help with your specific voicemail commands, refer to the help sites from the provider you chose. If you have an administrator, you can contact them for details and possible training.
Setting Up Personal Voicemail
The person that set up your network most likely configured a generic voicemail message, extension, and password. When you go into the voice mailbox for the first time, you can create a personalized message. In this example, we used FreePBX for our IP PBX. FreePBX uses Asterisk.
Step 1
Pick up the handset or press the speaker icon.
Step 2
Enter the key combination to access your voicemail. Common options are *98 or *99.
Step 3
You will receive a prompt for the extension. This is most likely the same number of the extension of the phone. In some cases you may be given a different extension. Check with your voice administrator or service provider.
Step 4
You will receive a prompt for the password. This may be the number of the extension of the phone or a number provided to you by your service provider.
Step 5
You will receive a prompt to state your name and click the pound key. Speak clearly into the phone.
Step 6
You can select 1 to save the name, 2 to listen to it, or 3 to re-record.
Step 7
You will receive a prompt to record a greeting and click the pound key.
Step 8
You can select 1 to save the greeting, 2 to listen to it , or 3 to re-record.
Step 9
You will receive a prompt to record a busy message.
Step 10
You can select 1 to save the busy message, 2 to listen to it, or 3 to re-record.
The next time time you access your voice mailbox, you have the option to change your password.
Change Voice Mailbox Settings
Step 1
