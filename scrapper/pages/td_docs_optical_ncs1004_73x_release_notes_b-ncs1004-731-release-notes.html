What's New in Cisco IOS XR Release
Cisco is continuously enhancing the product with every release and this section covers a brief description of key features and enhancements. It also includes links to detailed documentation, where available.
Feature Description
Configuration
400 TXP or MXP modes with CFP2 DCO for OTN-XP Card
On the OTN-XP card, you can configure a single 400GE or 4x100G payload that is received over the client port as a 400G signal over DWDM on the line side.
The card improves efficiency, performance, and flexibility for customer networks allowing 400GE or 4x100G client transport over 400G WDM wavelength.
Encryption Support on 1.2TL Card
AES 256 GCM authenticated OTNSec encryption on 1.2TL line cards is supported. It uses only pre-shared keys for authentication. Optical encryption secures the communications link in and out of a facility, rendering all data undecipherable to hackers who tap into networks.
Enhanced Q-Margin Support
Enhanced Q-Margin is supported for Forward error correction (FEC) and performance monitoring on CoherentDSP Controllers for 1.2T and 1.2TL cards. This enhanced Q-margin value is calculated based on the maximum number of errors for each frame. An attribute that is called instantaneous Q-margin is displayed in the output of the show controllers coherentDSP command. The lower the delta value between the instantaneous Q-margin value with the Q-margin value, the better the FEC performance of the NCS 1004 system. The instantaneous Q-margin values thus help you to optimize the system with continuous error correction in subsea transport networks.
Fast polling of SOP data
Fast polling of State of Polarization (SOP) data is enabled on the optics controller. NCS 1004 internally polls third-party devices (for example, AC1200) for subsea configuration parameters, such as SOP-S1, SOP-S2, and SOP-S3, and retrieves data every 1.6 seconds. A maximum of 1200 samples are collected in one minute for each trunk port.
This feature allows you to analyze the subsea cables and to study the possibility of earthquake occurrences.
Commands modified:
controller optics
show controllers
PRBS (Pseudo Random Binary Sequence) on ODU4
1.2T card supports PRBS on the ODU4 controller. This feature allows you to test whether the traffic is error free during link bring up without depending on the peer port.
Register Settings for Submarine Parameters
The register settings feature is supported on the 1.2T and 1.2TL cards and is enabled by default. The feature enables you to provision submarine proprietary parameter values and store them in specific memory locations of NCS 1004 system. These parameters are used for critical testing purposes. For example, you can assign value on how much power is required for the NCS 1004 system hardware so that it can be used for submarine testing to check the exact location of the fiber cut in the cable. This value can also be tuned for shorter or longer distance signal transmission.
Data Models
NETCONF Support for READ, WRITE, and Execute or Administrative Commands.
Support for IPv4 and IPv6 Ping test using the Cisco-IOS-XR-ping-act YANG model, instead of using CLI commands, is available. RPC (Remote Procedure Call) Request and Response messages are used to do the ping test, which is automated using scripts. This enables you to perform the ping test in a less time-consuming manner and to enhance network scalability.
OC (Open Configuration) Model for Client FEC and Laser Squelch
The OC model for configuring client FEC and Laser Squelch is available. This feature enables you to perform the configuration using scripts, which is less time-consuming. Also, the Open Configuration model supports the use of vendor-neutral data models to configure and manage the network.
OC (Open Configuration) Support for LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) on Management Port
The OC support for configuring LLDP on a management port is available. This feature enables you to perform the configuration using scripts, which is less time-consuming. Also, the Open Configuration model supports the use of vendor-neutral data models to configure and manage the network.
OC (Open Configuration) Support for Regen option
The OC support for configuring the Line Card in Regen mode is available. This enables you to perform the configuration using scripts, which is less time-consuming. Also, the Open Configuration model supports the use of vendor-neutral data models to configure and manage the network.
OC (Open Configuration) Terminal Device Revision
The Open Configuration terminal device revision to 1.7.2 allows you to provide LLDP support on the client optics. This feature allows you to learn LLDP neighbors and the topology of the devices for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) purposes.
gNOI for BERT
EMS gNOI supports Bit Error Rate Testing (BERT) operations on NCS 1004 for the following remote procedure calls (RPCs):
StartBERT
StopBERT
GetBERTResults
gNOI for BERT is a vendor agnostic open configuration method of enabling and testing network links through the Pseudo Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) feature.
OpenROADM
OpenROADM YANG support
The OpenROADM Multi-Source Agreement (MSA) device management model, which defines interoperability specifications for the control and provisioning of ROADM devices, is supported. The specifications consist of optical interoperability and a NETCONF API that uses YANG models. The goal of the OpenROADM MSA is to provide a common management model to simplify the management of multi-vender optical network architectures. With the OpenROADM YANG support, you can control and manage the device using an OpenROADM compliant controller and the OpenROADM YANG models.
Hardware
NCS1K4-2-QDD-C-K9 C-Band Line Card
NCS 1004 supports the NCS1K4-2-QDD-C-K9 C-Band line card. The card has eight client ports (QSFP28 and QSFP-DD) and two DWDM dual sub-channel module trunk ports. Each trunk port is capable of 200, 300, and 400 Gbps line rate with fine control of modulation format, baud-rate, and forward error correction. The trunk ports are software configurable. The line card supports module and slice configurations.
Commands added:
controller HundredGigECtrlr
Pluggables Support
The following pluggables are supported:
QSFP-40/100-SRBD
QSFP-100G-ER4L-S
QSFP-DD QDD-400G-FR4-S
QDD-400-AOCxM
