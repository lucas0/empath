    Value Statement
Our customer businesses are growing, and their network footprint is expanding at very fast rates.
●      This puts an increasing strain on the customer deployment teams as they run into an ever-increasing backlog of work to keep up with all the activity.
●      The average truck roll for the provisioning of new equipment costs anywhere from $1200 to $3000.
A key customer request has been to automate the onboarding of new devices into their network, therefore reducing the need to send deployment teams on site for provisioning and onboarding and increasing the speed at which the equipment becomes available for use.
Cisco Crosswork™ Zero-Touch Provisioning (ZTP) allows customers to provision and onboard new Cisco® IOS XR devices automatically. Using a common GUI and API via the Crosswork infrastructure, the network administrator can define policies for the provisioning of new devices. The result is a simplified onboarding process translating to significant time and cost savings by automating the process across many thousands of devices.
Product overview
Network operators are facing challenges to support the exponential growth of network devices. Providing a reliable way to automatically onboard these devices has become crucial to enable them to prepare for rapid expansion for 5G or other deployments. Access devices are often deployed in remote locations, which is often accompanied by the need for a truck roll to complete the provisioning, therefore increasing the need for automation. Cisco IOS XR7 software along with ZTP support enhances the entire customer experience of deploying new hardware and onboarding devices.
The Cisco Crosswork ZTP app provides an integrated turnkey solution to onboard a range of XR devices and enable faster time to deploy new hardware at a lower operating cost.
When a new device is powered up, ZTP provides the automated ability to download and apply the initial software load and configuration to complete the provisioning of this device. After applying the configuration, the app allows for downloading and executing additional scripts on the device. These scripts enable the operator to fetch additional RPMs (Linux binary packages) from the controller. ZTP simplifies the process of deploying a new device with Day 0 configuration and bringing it up to the desired state in an automated manner.
The fully integrated solution combines core capabilities from multiple innovative, industry-leading products—Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (NSO), Cisco Prime Network Registrar, and the Cisco Crosswork suite of applications—with common API and integrates with a common UI, providing control via a single pane of glass.
With the Cisco Crosswork ZTP application, customers can realize these outcomes:
●      Bring up the device with customer-certified software or image and obtain its IP address from a DHCP server such as Cisco Prime Network Registrar.
●      Download and apply an initial configuration.
●      Download and execute a shell script.
●      Manage the device family profile, device config, image, and scripts so that they are applied to the onboarded equipment in a unified manner based on customer preference.
●      Automatically onboard the new devices to Crosswork Device Lifecyle Manager for Day 1 operation.
●      Provide a turnkey automation solution to offer faster deployment of many new devices at machine speed, yielding ever-improving mean time to use as the savings compound across the larger numbers of devices over time.
The result? Increased profitability through faster deployment, optimized investments, and better OpEx utilization.
With release version 2.0, we have implemented Secure ZTP RFC8572. When Secure ZTP is enabled, certificate exchange mechanism is used, where the server and device certificates are validated before the image and configuration are downloaded.
A list of certificates used is shown in the table below:

Secure ZTP workflow
●      The device sends SUDI certificate, and the ZTP server validates the device with SUDI root.
●      The server responds with the ownership voucher and PDC.
●      The device verifies the ownership voucher and extracts the owner certificate from the PDC.
●      This establishes a way to trust the bootstrap data.
●      A trusted HTTPS connection is established using the owner certificate.
●      ZTP service generates bootstrap response containing onboarding information, which consists of download URL, pre-config, and post-config scripts. All artifacts shared through the secure connection are also encoded with the ownership voucher.
●      On receiving the information, the device requests the image, downloads the image, reboots the device, and applies the pre- and post-config scripts.
●      This completes the secure ZTP provisioning process, and the status is updated in the Crosswork ZTP server.
