Problem Description
On September 30 2020, Cisco Automated Software Distribution (ASD) service will decommission legacy API versions that are used by selected older products in the Cisco Small Business portfolio. As a result, these products will no longer be able to automatically identify and apply firmware updates. Affected products include:
Cisco FindIT Network Discovery Utility, versions 2.0.4 and earlier
Cisco RV130 and RV130W VPN Routers, all firmware versions
Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router, all firmware versions
Workaround
For the FindIT Network Discovery Utility, use of the ASD service may be restored by upgrading the utility to version 2.0.5 or later. The 2.0.5 update may be manually downloaded from the Cisco Software Center. Click here to access the URL.
The RV130, RV130W and RV215W router platforms are end-of-sale and will not be updated to support the new ASD API versions. Software updates for these platforms may be manually downloaded from the Cisco Software Center and applied to the device using the administration Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Software updates are available for the following platforms:
RV215W
RV130 Series
RV130W Series
For more information on the end-of-sale and recommended replacements, consult the end-of-sale bulletin.
