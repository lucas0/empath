Introduction
This document provides sample configurations on Fast EtherChannel (FEC) that uses Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) between a Cisco Catalyst 6000 Switch and a workstation or server. Any Cisco Catalyst 4000, 5000, and 6000 Series Switches that run a Catalyst operating system (CatOS) can be used in the configurations presented in this document to obtain the same results. This includes the Catalyst 2948G, 4912G, and 2980G Switches.
EtherChannel bundles individual Ethernet links into a single logical link that provides bandwidth up to 800 Mbps full-duplex for FastEthernet EtherChannel, or 8 Gbps full-duplex Gigabit EtherChannel (GEC) between a Catalyst 6000 Series Switch and another switch or host. Cisco Catalyst 4000 and 6000 Series Switches support Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) (802.3ad) since CatOS 7.1 software. LACP is another Etherchannel protocol that can be used instead of PAgP.
This document covers configurations that use PAgP, which is a Cisco proprietary protocol. A workstation/server Network Interface Card (NIC) might not support this protocol. Therefore, it is necessary to configure the switch as shown in this document.
For Cisco Catalyst switches that run Cisco IOSÂ® software, refer to EtherChannel Between a Cisco Catalyst Switch That Runs Cisco IOS and a Workstation or Server Configuration Example.
Refer to these links for more information on how to configure EtherChannel and guidelines on Catalyst switches that run CatOS:
Configuring EtherChannel on Catalyst 6500
Configuring EtherChannel on Catalyst 5000
Configuring EtherChannel on Catalyst 4000
Also, make sure that you verify the server NIC documentation for any guidelines for interoperation with Cisco switches. The configuration of NIC adapter is beyond the scope of this document. Configuration options are a proprietary function of the third party NIC adapter vendor.
All Ethernet ports on all modules support EtherChannel (maximum of eight compatibly configured ports). This includes Ethernet ports on a standby supervisor engine. All ports in each EtherChannel must be the same speed and duplex. There is no requirement that ports be contiguous, except for some Catalyst 5000 Switching modules or on the same module. Refer to Configuring Fast EtherChannel and Gigabit EtherChannel for more information.
If a link within an EtherChannel fails, traffic previously carried over the failed link switches to the segments within the EtherChannel that remain.
In the sample configuration in this document, an EtherChannel link is created to carry traffic for one VLAN across two fast Ethernet ports between a Catalyst 6000 Switch and a Windows NT workstation.

Important Notes
This section provides information for Catalyst 4000, 5000, and 6000 Switches that run CatOS.
The Catalyst 4000 and 6000 Series Switches, along with the 2948G and 2980G Switches, support EtherChannel on any combination of ports on different modules as long as they have the same speed/duplex, and the modules are installed in the same switch chassis.
Catalyst 5000 Switches might only support EtherChannel within the same blade and within the same group of ports. This depends on the module. Refer to Configuring Fast EtherChannel and Gigabit EtherChannel for Catalyst 5000 restrictions and guidelines. Issue the show port capabilities command to check this. The EtherChannel capacity is explicitly stated, as shown in this output:

EtherChannel Modes
Mode Explanation
On This mode forces the port to channel without PAgP. With the on mode, a usable EtherChannel exists only when a port group in on mode is connected to another port group in the on mode. This mode is used if the NIC does not support PAgP (recommended).
Desirable The PAgP mode that places a port into an active negotiating state, in which the port initiates negotiations with other ports by sending PAgP packets. This mode is used if the NIC supports PAgP.
silent The keyword that is used with the auto or desirable mode when no traffic is expected from the other device to prevent the link from being reported to the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) as down. (default)
non-silent The keyword that is used with the auto or desirable mode when traffic is expected from the other device.
For Workstations or Servers
This document provides a configuration for a server that supports FEC without PAgP support.
Note: Check with the NIC vendor for support of Cisco proprietary FEC and PAgP. Some servers might support LACP, which is preferred. Make sure your switch runs Catalyst OS 7.1 or later in order to support LACP.
Once the NIC adapters are teamed and a new connection is formed, the individual NIC adapters are disabled and will not be accessible through the old IP address. Configure the new connection with static IP address, default gateway, and DNS/WINS settings, or for dynamic configuration.
Configure
In this section, you are presented with the information to configure the features described in this document.
Note: Use the Command Lookup Tool (registered customers only) to find more information on the commands used in this document.
Network Diagram
This document uses this network setup:
The EtherChannel should start on a single device and end on a single device. An EtherChannel should not start on a single workstation, or on a switch and end on different workstations or different switches. In the same way, an EtherChannel should not start from two different workstations or different switches and end on a single workstation or on a single switch. As an exception, if Cisco Catalyst 3750 Stack is used as an end-point, the EtherChannel can either start or end on different member switches of the same stack. Refer to Cross-Stack EtherChannel on a Catalyst 3750 Switch Configuration Example for this Cross-Stack EtherChannel configuration.
Configurations
This configuration is applied to the Fast Ethernet ports on the Catalyst 6000 Switch. These are the general configuration tasks:
Assign a VLAN to the Fast Ethernet ports.
Disable trunking on the Fast Ethernet ports (highly recommended).
Enable spanning tree portfast on the Fast Ethernet ports (highly recommended).
Set EtherChannel modes on the Fast Ethernet ports.
Configure a EtherChannel load-balance distribution algorithm.
