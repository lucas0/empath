Cisco Business Edition 4000 - Great Solution
The Cisco Business Edition 4000 is a great product. It does exactly what it was built for, and the hardware components are very solid. The hardware is built with redundancy for the power supplies.

Best cloud management for IP phones and user friendly
As it is a completely cloud-based product this is easy to access. We easily manage or access it from anywhere. It is very easy to deploy and easy to manage and use. Its mobile device integration feature is very good and we loved it. It is ideal for remote access.
