Introduction
This document describes how to configure a remote router (Cisco 3640) to dial the central site using an analog POTS line in the event that the Frame Relay connection goes down. The Cisco 3640 uses dialer profiles to provide the backup interface for the Frame Relay link. Also, a specific async interface is set aside for backup dialout. Note that this configuration can be expanded to include Multilink PPP, which would significantly increase the bandwidth available for the backup connection. See the Multilink PPP for DDR - Basic Configuration and Verification document for more information.
This document shows how to configure a backup connection with a routing protocol running on the async link. Careful consideration is needed before implementing such a design as the bandwidth used by the routing protocol may curtail the bandwidth available for data transfer. Snapshot routing or static routes may be used across the async link, instead of a routing protocol.

Components Used
The information in this document is based on the software and hardware versions below.

Cisco 7206
The information presented in this document was created from devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If you are working in a live network, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command before using it.
Background Theory
It is common to provide redundant paths for WAN connections such as Frame Relay with dial-on-demand circuits. Asynchronous modems and circuit-switched Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) lines are regularly used to backup WAN interfaces. Careful planning is necessary when designing dial backup scenarios. Factors such as traffic on the backup links, the number of links susceptible to failure, and port capacity planning to support backup circuits must be considered.
Three common methods available to provide backup for a WAN link are:
Backup interfaces
Dialer Watches
Floating static routes
A backup interface remains inactive until the primary link goes down. The backup link is then activated, reestablishing the connection between the two sites. When implementing backup interfaces for Frame Relay links, point-to-point subinterfaces on the Frame Relay links are advantageous since the main or multipoint interfaces may remain in an up/up state even if primary virtual circuits (PVCs) go down, causing the backup interface to not be activated. It is also advisable to configure Frame Relay end-to-end keepalives on your network for Cisco IOSÂ® Software release 12.05(T) or later. Refer to the Frame Relay End-to-End Keepalive document for more information.
A Dialer Watch provides reliable connectivity without relying solely on defining interesting traffic to trigger outgoing calls at the central router. The Dialer Watch monitors certain specific routes and, if those networks are unreachable, the Dialer Watch brings up the secondary link. Refer to the Configuring DDR Backup using BRIs and Dialer Watch document for more information on dialer watches.
Floating static routes are static routes that have an administrative distance greater than the administrative distance of dynamic routes. Administrative distances can be configured on a static route so that the static route is less desirable than a dynamic route; hence, the static route is not used when the dynamic route is available. However, if the dynamic route is lost, the static route can take over and traffic can be sent through this alternative route. Refer to the Configuring ISDN Backup for Frame Relay document for an example on how to configure backups with floating static routes.
When designing a dial backup scenario, remember to consider factors such as traffic patterns on the backup links, the number of links that might fail, and the number of ports available at the central-site in a worst-case situation.
Configure
In this section, you are presented with the information to configure the features described in this document.
Network Diagram
This document uses the network setup shown in the diagram below.
Configurations
This document uses the configurations shown below.
Note: The configurations in this document are based on Cisco IOS Software Release 12.0(7)T running on a Cisco 3640 and an AS5200 Network Access Server. The Cisco 3640 has an NM-8AM Analog Modem Network Modules Card that allows the router to place up to eight outgoing analog calls without using an external modem.
The AS5200 has been configured as a regular Access Server capable of supporting both ISDN and async dialup users as well as the backup connection.
The configuration of maui-rtr-06 (Cisco 7206) is irrelevant to the dial backup scenario. The Cisco 7206 is only used to terminate the incoming WAN links. The configuration is not necessary to demonstrate async backup.

Troubleshoot
This section provides information you can use to troubleshoot your configuration.
Troubleshooting Commands
Certain show commands are supported by the Output Interpreter tool, which allows you to view an analysis of show command output.
Note: Before issuing debug commands, please see Important Information on Debug Commands.
debug dialer events - To display debugging information about the packets received on a dialer interface. When Dial on Demand Routing (DDR) is enabled on the interface, information concerning the cause of any call (called the Dialing cause) is also displayed. For more information, see the debug dialer event information in the Debug Commands documentation.
debug dialer packets - To display debugging information about the packets received on a dialer interface. The no form of this command disables debugging output. For more information, see the debug dialer packets information in the Debug Commands documentation.
debug ppp - To display information on traffic and exchanges in an internetwork implementing PPP. The no form of this command disables debugging output.
[no] debug ppp {packet | negotiation | error | authentication}
For more information, see the debug ppp information in the Debug Commands documentation.
debug isdn event - To display ISDN events occurring on the user side (on the router) of the ISDN interface. Q.931 ISDN events are displayed (call setup and teardown of ISDN network connections). The no form of this command disables debugging output.
debug isdn q931 - To display information about call setup and teardown of ISDN network connections (Layer 3) between the local router (user side) and the network. The no form of this command disables debugging output. For more information, see the debug isdn q931 information in the Debug Commands documentation.
