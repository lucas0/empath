Benefits
Performance for the next decade
The Cisco 8000 Series routers have the capability to redefine the economics of the Internet. They provide breakthrough density and massive scale, building the foundation of a new network for the next decade.
400G optimized platforms that scale from 10.8 Tbps to 260 Tbps.
Design flexibility with up to 648 port configurations that support 100G or 400G throughput.
Distinguished from System-on-Chip (SoC) designs by supporting full routing functionality on a single ASIC.
Fully featured carrier-grade routing platform delivering superior density, performance, scalability, and buffering.
Simplified operations
The 8000 Series routers provide massive capacity in high-density designs, allowing communication service providers to reduce operational footprints, lower carbon emissions, and evolve to more efficient network architectures.
Cloud-enhanced design for easier integration with orchestration and management tools.
Common architecture and designs across modular and fixed routers provide topological regularity, scalability, and operational simplicity.
Real-time telemetry feeds for improved network visibility and control.
New fabric-based architectures for easy scale out and higher resiliency.
Proactive security
The Cisco 8000 Series Routers enhance security by enabling you to measure, audit, verify, and enforce the trustworthiness of your critical infrastructure.
A hardware root of trust based on the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) and IEEE 802.1 AR standards.
Cisco Chip Protection that monitors the fingerprints of the physical components to validate that no counterfeit items have been introduced to the unit.
Every software image downloaded from Cisco is cryptographically signed using private keys.
All Cisco 8100 and 8200 routers are FIPS 140-2 Level 2 compliant and support advanced security features to ensure platform and OS integrity.
Sustainability
The Cisco 8000 Series, based on the break-through Silicon One ASIC, is a high performance platform of routers that is 3x more power efficient and twice as dense as the closest competitor. You can now meet the demands of the network while reducing your power consumption and carbon footprint.
Award winning innovation
Cisco 8000 Series Routers earn the Best of Show Award, for Network Infrastructure at Interop Tokyo two years in a row.

Integrated innovations
Modernized network operating system
The 8000 Series utilizes the IOS XR operating system platform to simplify operations for users and help reduce complexity.
Reduce OpEx with customization based on the features you need rather than forcing a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach.
Ease the delivery and deployment with simplified installation procedures.
Facilitate integration to orchestration and management tools thanks to a wide variety of open APIs.
Next generation silicon design
Cisco Silicon One provides the performance and efficiency of switching with the scale, buffering, programmability, and carrier-class features of routing.
Unified architecture provides for accelerated innovation and service deployments.
More than twice the network bandwidth in a single ASIC than any other routing silicon.
Delivers consistent features, services, and telemetry across network roles, including full-featured router-on-a-chip, line card network processor, or fabric element in a modular router.
