Umbrella, worth it's weight for sure
Cisco umbrella protects the whole network. While you can have an agent installed on machines to provide more protection abilities and filtering, you more than likely have IoT devices on your network and you want to make sure those aren't working with bad actors.

Cisco Umbrella Great Product and Price!
Umbrella has stood up to all of the major DNS vector threats (e.g., CC) we have encountered from APTs to criminal elements attempting to penetrate our network, whether to steal IP or install malware on our network. In conjunction with our suite of other security products, Umbrella has withstood the test of time. We have had this product on our network for over 3 years now with no complaints.
