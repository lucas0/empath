    The Cisco Crosswork Cloud Traffic Analysis™ platform addresses Traffic Analysis, Peering Prospecting, and Peering Engineering challenges by providing a comprehensive network view and analysis of traffic at network peering boundaries designed to visualize and optimize traffic flows.
Product overview
Your network can be complex and often unpredictable. Traffic from over-the-top applications, automated systems, malicious attacks, or variations from simple operational errors can have unforeseen effects on traffic flows. Network operators need a scalable and insightful toolset to help them visualize and optimize their traffic congestion at key points within their network. Today’s network devices can produce vast amounts of data both on statistics and flows. Operators need effective tools to consume and correlate this critical traffic data at scale and at low operational cost. Crosswork Cloud Traffic Analysis’ analytics capabilities are being integrated into the Crosswork Network Automation portfolio as a new cloud-based SaaS offering traffic analysis and recommendation for edge network devices.
Cisco Crosswork Cloud Traffic Analysis service is a hosted application that provides rich analysis, visualization, and optimization recommendations for network traffic flows. Traffic Analysis helps you understand the flow of traffic across key points in your network and is delivered as a scale-out cloud service. This allows day-zero deployment with feature sets that are always up to date, with very low ongoing maintenance requirements.
Cisco Crosswork Cloud Traffic Analysis aggregates traffic flow data across multiple devices, giving operators a view of the traffic matrix across the whole network. It adds critical context to observed traffic flows based on the existing rich data sets of external routing data from the Cisco Crosswork Cloud Traffic Analysis External Route Analysis service. This allows operators to gain a deeper understanding of the origins of traffic flows on their networks, as well as the impacts of changes in external routing state and policy.
Cisco Crosswork Cloud Traffic Analysis is designed to provide actionable recommendations for optimizing traffic at congested network edges. As the number of peering points expand in today’s distributed networks, delivering this end-to-end traffic visibility at scale becomes a critical requirement for effective network optimization. This visibility allows network operators to drive manual or automated changes that are clear and easy to implement based on defined policies – throughout the network.
Cisco Crosswork Cloud Traffic Analysis helps address key Service Provider and Enterprise customer challenges such as who should you peer with and what changes do you need to make to achieve a Peering Traffic load balance with engineering recommendations applicable at all SP Network IGP boundaries. By effectively extracting and managing huge amounts of data, operators can rapidly address and even proactively avoid disrupting events and impending security threats. Crosswork Traffic Analysis technology will help to provide reliable, timely, and actionable information about what’s happening in the network 24/7 to deliver premium networked experiences.
Cisco Crosswork Cloud Traffic Analysis offers a networking monitoring solution for complex enterprise and service provider networks. The solution supports both cloud and on-premises server, router, switch, and firewall hardware. The Cisco Crosswork Cloud Traffic Analysis solution captures, enriches, and analyzes network data to help service providers, web companies, and enterprises to improve network performance, manage costs, gain visibility, and reduce downtime.
Prominent feature
Product description
Cisco Crosswork Cloud has added a new module, Traffic Analysis. This capability expands on the existing cloud-based platform by presenting up-to-date network traffic change information. It uses standards-based traffic flow protocols in combination with a cloud-native architecture to capture the state of your network’s congestion across aggregated entry points. A critical step in reducing the Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) for network edge congestion issues is the identification of which nodes are congested and what traffic flows are causing the congestion.
Figure 1.               
Mean Time to Resolution with Traffic Analysis
The Traffic Analysis features provide awareness of distributed congestion between multiple network elements at network boundaries. The platform differentiates itself buy its ability to view the utilization state of multiple devices and what traffic is causing the congestion. Traffic Analysis uses protocols like NetFlow, BGP, IPFix, and SNMP to enable multivendor support for traffic information awareness. Subscribers can analyze live and historical activity of the traffic matrix information for groups of network devices. Users can also quickly and easily identify what changes are required in order to better distribute traffic between multiple devices. This can enable network owners to maximize the capability of all the assets during peak operating periods.
Network control protocols such as IGPs, BGP, RSVP-TE, and segment routing enable network operators to influence how traffic enters and exits internal routing domains. Network boundaries often have multiple entry points. It can be difficult to continuously identify which IP routes can be manipulated in order to meet operational needs. The Cisco Crosswork Cloud Traffic Analysis module is designed to give your organization the tools to identify and understand what changes need to be made to manage distributed congestion events at the edges of your networks. This unique service will significantly reduce the time it takes to know which edge devices are being congested and what traffic is causing that congestion.
The Traffic Analysis module removes the complexity and steps required for network operators or automation systems to quickly answer questions about short-lived edge congestion that cannot wait for hardware upgrades or significant changes to the network structure. The service is designed to improve the performance and reduce operational costs of multi-homed networks. By adding intelligence to routing changes, Traffic Analysis leverages a company’s existing network connectivity to deliver substantial network performance improvements, allowing for a better return on investment.
Cisco Crosswork Cloud Traffic Analysis collects network data through a secure, federated collection model and provides traffic data analytics to significantly reduce mean time to resolve edge congestion. This cloud service provides network operators the following initial capabilities:
●     Real-time and historical visualizations of traffic matrixes for devices, device groups, and interfaces
●     Alarms and notifications
●     ASN and per-IP route traffic statistics
●     Top-X traffic matrix table browser
●     Flexible traffic dashboards and reports
Figure 2.               
Key use cases
Continuous traffic event awareness and management
The Cisco Crosswork Cloud Traffic Analysis platform features continuous monitoring of traffic event workflow use cases:
●     Independent monitoring traffic forwarding matrix information
●     Monitor changing traffic flows to critical destinations inside and outside my network
◦    Monitor critical third-party traffic flows
◦    Monitor traffic flows to my hosted infrastructure
●     Forensic combination of BGP and traffic flow update analysis
◦    Understand how route changes impact traffic capacity
◦    Identify which route events triggered specific traffic profile changes
●     Traffic event search criteria
◦    Top-X prefix searches associated with ASN, device, and interface groupings
◦    Utilization per top prefixes based on ASN, device, and interface groupings
Monitored IP route prefix and ASN traffic history
The traffic history enables the user to quickly identify IP prefix traffic events of importance. Events can be sorted and searched in various ways to quickly locate the root cause of a service impacting incident. Once an event is located, the detailed information for that event can be viewed as part of the next action. Subscribers will have different lookback periods based on the tier of subscription purchased.
Top talkers dashboards
The dashboard feature provides an immediate view of top talker information for various network elements, including top transit and to/from ASNs as well as top prefixes and top devices. This view is the entry point into identification of which network segments are the most frequently consuming network elements.
Figure 3.               
Top Talker Dashboard
Traffic matrix index search
The traffic search feature enables users to quickly locate specific prefixes or ASNs that are of interest based on the size and direction of flows and to then use these selections to graphically compare their traffic rates over time.
Figure 4.               
Traffic Search Feature
Device and interface traffic statistics
The time series traffic statistics feature shows the data rates for both devices and interfaces over a respective sample period. This can be useful to determine when specific traffic events occurred and use these time points. A user can further apply this information to quickly locate which IP route prefixes or ASNs are causing the event.
Figure 5.               
Time Series Traffic Statistics Feature
Traffic grouping view
When a number of items need to be compared over time, the user can group common items and compare their traffic profile over time. This feature can be beneficial when investigating traffic flows based on unexpected or disjoint groups of network objects. It can also be useful in matching flow capacities based on opposite directions, to better understand the impact based on direction through different places in the network.
