Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCvx28898 SUDI certificate expiration may impact functionality
Problem Description
A Cisco Secure Unique Device Identifier (SUDI) certificate that is registered to a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and that is also used to configure certain functionalities will expire on a limited number of Cisco Catalyst Switching products (see the Products Affected section). Any service that relies on a SUDI certificate to establish a secure connection might not work after the certificate expires.
Background
SUDI is an X.509v3 certificate which maintains the product identifier and serial number. The identity is implemented at manufacturing and is linked to a publicly identifiable root Certificate Authority (CA). The SUDI can be used as an immutable identity for configuration, security, auditing, and management.
The Cisco SUDI certificate, when registered to a PKI and used to configure certain functionalities on Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE, will expire on a limited number of Catalyst Switching products either on [the date of manufacture + 10 years] or on 2029-05-14, whichever is earlier. Any service that relies on a SUDI certificate to establish a secure connection might not work after the certificate expires.
In order to determine the SUDI certification expiration date, enter this command: show crypto pki certificates
  Sample Output:
switch> show crypto pki certificates
 
Certificate
Status: Available
Certificate Serial Number (hex): 051E49D9
Certificate Usage: General Purpose
Issuer:
cn=ACT2 SUDI CA
o=Cisco
Subject:
Name: <product id>
Serial Number: PID:<product id> SN:<serial no>
cn=<product id>
ou=ACT-2 Lite SUDI
o=Cisco
serialNumber=PID:<product id> SN:<serial no>
Validity Date:
start date: 02:23:17 UTC Apr 20 2020
end date: 20:25:41 UTC May 14 2029
Associated Trustpoints: CISCO_IDEVID_SUDI
  In order to determine if a SUDI trust point is used, enter this command:
Switch# show run | i CISCO_IDEVID_SUDI
  Various features that might be linked to the SUDI certificate are shown in these sample configurations:
HTTPS
ip http secure-trustpoint CISCO_IDEVID_SUDI
ip http client secure-trustpoint CISCO_IDEVID_SUDI
  SSH authentication that uses certificates
ip ssh server certificate
   profile server
      trustpoint sign CISCO_IDEVID_SUDI
  Zero Touch Deployment (ZTD) that uses a certificate enrollment profile for enrollment or reenrollment
crypto pki profile enrollment profile-name
   credential CISCO_IDEVID_SUDI
Problem Symptom
Any services that rely on a trust point that is configured with an expired Cisco SUDI certificate will be affected. Some examples are:
HTTP Server over TLS (HTTPS) - HTTPS will produce an error in the browser which indicates that the certificate is expired.
SSH Server - Applications that use SUDI certificates to authenticate the SSH session might fail to authenticate.
Note: This use of SUDI certificates is rare. Username/password authentication and non-SUDI public/private key authentication are not affected.
Workaround/Solution
Customers should use one of these four workaround methods in order to install and use an alternate certificate:
Install a certificate from a CA.
Use the local Cisco IOS CA server to generate and sign a new certificate.
Use OpenSSL to generate a PKCS12 certificate bundle and import the bundle to Cisco IOS.
Use Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) to acquire a certificate from the customer's PKI.
Note: Introduction of a new certificate on a device might require import of the issuer's certificate on any peer devices where the new certificate is used to protect communication.
Note: After a new non-SUDI certificate is obtained, the configuration of any feature that is identified in the Background section must be updated. The trust point configuration commands must be reconfigured to be able to use the new certificate.
  Workaround 1
Install a certificate from a CA.
In this workaround, a certificate request is generated and displayed by Cisco IOS. The administrator then copies the request and submits it to a third-party CA and retrieves the result.
Note: Use of a CA to sign certificates is a security best-practice. This procedure is provided as a workaround in this field notice. However, it is preferable to continue to use the third-party CA-signed certificate after you apply this workaround, rather than to use a self-signed certificate.
In order to install a certificate from a third-party CA, complete these steps:
1.   Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).
Switch#conf t
Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z.
Switch(config)# crypto pki trustpoint TEST
Switch(ca-trustpoint)# enrollment term pem
Switch(ca-trustpoint)# subject-name CN=TEST
Switch(ca-trustpoint)# revocation-check none
Switch(ca-trustpoint)# rsakeypair TEST
Switch(ca-trustpoint)# exit
Switch(config)# crypto pki enroll TEST
% Start certificate enrollment ..
% The subject name in the certificate will include: CN=TEST
% The subject name in the certificate will include: Switch.cisco.com
% The serial number in the certificate will be: <serial no>
% Include an IP address in the subject name? [no]: no
Display Certificate Request to terminal? [yes/no]: yes
Certificate Request follows:
 
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
A Base64 Certificate is displayed here. Copy it, along with the ---BEGIN and ---END lines.
-----END CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
---End - This line not part of the certificate request---
2.   Submit the CSR to the third-party CA.
Note: The procedure to submit the CSR to a third-party CA and retrieve the resulting certificate varies based on the CA that is used. Consult the documentation of your CA for instructions on how to perform this step.
3.   Download the new identity certificate for the switch along with the CA certificate.
4.   Install the CA certificate on the device.
Switch# conf t
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
Switch(config)# crypto pki auth TEST
Enter the base 64 encoded CA certificate.
End with a blank line or the word "quit" on a line by itself
    
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
REMOVED
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
   
Certificate has the following attributes:
   Fingerprint MD5: 79D15A9F C7EB4882 83AC50AC 7B0FC625
   Fingerprint SHA1: 0A80CC2C 9C779D20 9071E790 B82421DE B47E9006
% Do you accept this certificate? [yes/no]: yes
Trustpoint CA certificate accepted.
% Certificate successfully imported
Install the identity certificate on the device.
Switch(config)# crypto pki import TEST certificate
    Enter the base 64 encoded certificate.
End with a blank line or the word "quit" on a line by itself
 
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
REMOVED
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
    
% Switch Certificate successfully imported
  Workaround 2
Use the local Cisco IOS CA server to generate and sign a new certificate.
Note: The local CA server feature is not available on all products.
Switch# conf t
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
Switch(config)# ip http server
Switch(config)# crypto pki server IOS-CA
Switch(cs-server)# grant auto
Switch(cs-server)# database level complete
Switch(cs-server)# no shut
 
%Some server settings cannot be changed after CA certificate generation.

  Workaround 3
Use OpenSSL to generate a PKCS12 certificate bundle and import the bundle to Cisco IOS.
Note: This process generates a self-signed certificate and a corresponding key-pair package into a PKCS12 formatted file. This file is protected only by a password. Compromise of the password or of the key-pair itself will enable an unauthorized party to replicate this certificate. Appropriate steps should be taken to keep the key-pair and password confidential.
1.   Generate a PKCS12 certificate bundle.
Linux, UNIX, or macOS example:
User@linux-box$ openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout tmp.key -x509 -days 4000 -out tmp.cer -subj
"/CN=SelfSignedCert" &> /dev/null && openssl pkcs12 -export -in tmp.cer -inkey tmp.key -out tmp.bin
-passout pass:<use a secure password> && openssl pkcs12 -export -out certificate.pfx
-password pass:<use a secure password> -inkey
tmp.key -in tmp.cer && rm tmp.bin tmp.key tmp.cer && openssl base64 -in certificate.pfx

  Workaround 4
Use SCEP to acquire a certificate from the customer's PKI.
This use case is typical for utility customers. Follow these steps to set up the device to acquire a certificate from the customer's PKI:
1.   Create a new trustpoint Locally Significant Device Identifier (LDevID).
crypto pki trustpoint LDevID
 enrollment retry count 10
 enrollment retry period 2
 enrollment profile LDevID
 serial-number none
 fqdn none
 ip-address none
 password
 fingerprint 3F520C4C0F3236C9CA3D5C209C9948EC
 subject-name serialNumber=PID:<product id> SN:<serial no>,CN=<serial no>
 revocation-check none
 rsakeypair LDevID 2048
2.   Create an enrollment profile for the new trustpoint LDevID.
crypto pki profile enrollment LDevID
 enrollment url  http://192.168.0.254:80  < This is the RA or CA IP address and the port number.
3.   Authenticate the trustpoint.
conf t
crypto pki authenticate LDevID
4.   Enroll the trustpoint.
conf t
crypto pki enroll LDevID
5.   Use the new LDevID certificate instead of SUDI for configurations and applications.
