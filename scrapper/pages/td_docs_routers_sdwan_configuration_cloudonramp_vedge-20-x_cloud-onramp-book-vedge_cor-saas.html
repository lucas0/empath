Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.8.1
Cisco vManage Release 20.8.1
This feature adds better visibility into how Cloud onRamp for SaaS determines the best path for Microsoft Office 365 traffic, if you have opted to use Microsoft telemetry.
One enhancement is a chart that shows how Microsoft rates the connection quality of different interfaces, specifically for different types (called service areas) of Office 365 traffic. This is helpful for troubleshooting Office 365 performance issues.
Another addition is the SD-AVC Cloud Connector page, which shows a list of Microsoft URL and IP endpoints and categories that Cisco SD-WAN receives from Microsoft Cloud.
Many organizations rely on software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications for business-critical functions. These cloud-based services include Amazon AWS, Box, Dropbox, Google Apps, Office 365, and many others. As cloud-based services, these SaaS applications must communicate with their own remote servers, which are available through internet connections.
At remote sites, SaaS applications may pose these special challenges:
Performance: If remote sites, such as branch offices, route SaaS traffic through a centralized location, such as a data center, performance degrades, with latency that affects the user experience.
Inability to optimize routing: Network administrators may not have any visibility into the performance of these SaaS applications, or any ability to change the routing of the SaaS traffic to more efficient paths.
Cloud onRamp for SaaS (formerly called CloudExpress service) addresses these challenges. It enables you to select specific SaaS applications and interfaces, and to let Cisco SD-WAN determine the best performing path for each SaaS application, using the specified interfaces. For example, you can enable:
routing through a direct internet access (DIA) connection at a branch site, if available
routing through a gateway location, such as a regional data center
Ensuring the best path for cloud traffic is critical. SD-WAN monitors each available path for each SaaS application continually, so if a problem occurs in one path, it can adjust dynamically and move SaaS traffic to a better path.

Common Scenarios for Using Cloud onRamp for SaaS
For an organization using SD-WAN, a branch site typically routes SaaS application traffic by default over SD-WAN overlay links to a data center. From the data center, the SaaS traffic reaches the SaaS server.
For example, in a large organization with a central data center and branch sites, employees might use Office 365 at a branch site. By default, the Office 365 traffic at a branch site would be routed over SD-WAN overlay links to a centralized data center, and from there to the Office 365 cloud server.
Scenario 1: If the branch site has a direct internet access (DIA) connection, you may choose to improve performance by routing the SaaS traffic through that direct route, bypassing the data center.
Scenario 2: If the branch site connects to a gateway site that has DIA links, you may choose to enable SaaS traffic to use the DIA of the gateway site.
Scenario 3: Hybrid method.
Scenario 1: Cloud Access through Direct Internet Access Links
Scenario 2: Cloud Access through a Gateway Site
Scenario 3: Hybrid Approach
Scenario 1: Cloud Access through Direct Internet Access Links
In this scenario, a branch site has one or more direct internet access (DIA) links, as shown in the illustration below.
Using Cloud onRamp for SaaS, SD-WAN can select the best connection for each SaaS application through the DIA links or through the SD-WAN overlay links. Note that the best connection may differ for different SaaS applications. For example, Office365 traffic may be faster through one link, and Dropbox traffic may be faster through a different link.
Scenario 2: Cloud Access through a Gateway Site
In this scenario, a branch site has one or more direct connections to a gateway site, and the gateway site has links to the internet.
Using Cloud onRamp for SaaS, SD-WAN can select the best connection for each SaaS application through the gateway site. If the branch site connects to more than one gateway site, SD-WAN ensures that SaaS traffic uses the best path for each SaaS application, even through different gateway sites.
Scenario 3: Hybrid Approach
In this scenario, a branch site has both direct internet access (DIA) links, and links to a gateway site, which also has links to the internet.
Using Cloud onRamp for SaaS, SD-WAN can select the best connection for each SaaS application, either through DIA links or through the gateway site.
Best Path Determination
Cloud onRamp for SaaS selects the best path for each application using an algorithm that takes input from the following sources.

Information About Cloud OnRamp for SaaS Probing Through VPN 0 Interfaces at Gateway Sites
A branch site may connect to the internet through one or more direct internet access (DIA) interfaces at the branch site itself, or through a gateway site, which might use a service VPN or VPN 0 to connect to the internet.
In addition to probing the DIA interfaces at a branch site, Cloud OnRamp for SaaS can probe interfaces at a gateway site, whether they use service VPNs (VPN 1, VPN 2, …) or the transport VPN (VPN 0), when determining the best path to use for the traffic of specified cloud applications. This is helpful when the branch site connects to the internet through a gateway site.
When configuring Cloud OnRamp for SaaS to use the gateway site, specify whether the gateway site uses service VPNs or VPN 0 to connect to the internet, as shown in the following illustrations.
Figure 1. Branch Site Connects to a Gateway Site That Uses Service VPNs to Connect to the Internet
Figure 2. Branch Site Connects to a Gateway Site That Uses VPN 0 to Connect to the Internet
Benefits of Cloud onRamp for SaaS
Benefits of Cloud OnRamp for SaaS Probing Through VPN 0 Interfaces at Gateway Sites
Benefits of Cloud OnRamp for SaaS Probing Through VPN 0 Interfaces at Gateway Sites
In some network scenarios, a site connects to the internet, entirely or in part, through a gateway site that uses a VPN 0 interface to connect to the internet. This is in contrast to using service VPNs (VPN 1, VPN 2, …).
When the gateway site connects to the internet using VPN 0, the best path to cloud application servers may be through the VPN 0 interface. When Cloud onRamp for SaaS probes for the best path for the traffic of specified cloud applications, it can probe through VPN 0 interfaces at gateway sites. This extends the best path options to include more of the available interfaces connected to the internet.

Note
A branch site that connects to the internet through a gateway site may also connect to the internet through one or more DIA interfaces at the branch site itself.

Prerequisites for Cloud OnRamp for SaaS
The following sections describe the prerequisites for Cloud OnRamp for SaaS features.
Prerequisites for Cloud onRamp for SaaS, General
Prerequisites for Cloud OnRamp for SaaS Probing Through VPN 0 Interfaces at Gateway Sites
Prerequisites for Cloud onRamp for SaaS, General
The prerequisites for using Cloud onRamp for SaaS differ for Cisco vEdge devices and Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. For information about using Cloud onRamp for SaaS with Cisco vEdge devices, see Cloud OnRamp Configuration Guide for vEdge Routers, Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.
For Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices, the requirements are:
The devices must be running Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.1a or later.
The devices must be in vManage mode.
All Cisco vSmart Controller instances must be in vManage mode.
A centralized policy that includes an application-aware policy must be activated. You can configure more than one centralized policy in Cisco vManage, but only one can be active.

Note
This is an important difference from using Cloud onRamp for SaaS with Cisco vEdge devices, which do not have this requirement.
Cloud onRamp for SaaS is enabled (Administration > Settings).
To specify traffic by Office 365 traffic category, the following are also required:
Cisco SD-AVC is enabled (Administration > Cluster Management).
Cisco SD-AVC Cloud Connector is enabled (Administration > Settings). If Cloud Connector is not enabled, policies specifying Office 365 traffic cannot match the Office 365 traffic. The traffic uses the default path, rather than the best path selected by Cloud onRamp for SaaS.
Prerequisites for Cloud OnRamp for SaaS Probing Through VPN 0 Interfaces at Gateway Sites
Cloud onRamp for SaaS probing through VPN 0 interfaces at gateway sites presupposes that a branch site connects to the internet through a gateway site, and that the gateway site connects to the internet using a VPN 0 interface. The branch site may or may not also connect to the internet through one or more DIA connections.
Restrictions for Cloud onRamp for SaaS
The following section(s) describe the restrictions applicable to Cloud OnRamp for SaaS features.
Restrictions for Cloud onRamp for SaaS, General
Restrictions for Cloud onRamp for SaaS, General
Configuring Cloud onRamp for SaaS when a site is using a loopback as a transport locator (TLOC) interface is not supported.
Configuring Cloud OnRamp for SaaS on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices is only through centralized app-aware policy using match condition "cloud-saas-app-list" and action "cloud-saas". For mixed deployments including Cisco SD-WAN and Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices, we recommend to have different app-aware policies for Cisco SD-WAN and Cisco IOS-XE SD-WAN devices.

How many sites are operating with Cloud onRamp for SaaS.
A color-coded rating of the Quality of Experience (vQoE) score for the application (green=good score, yellow=moderate score, red=poor score) on the devices operating at each site.
Optionally, you can click a tile to show details of Cloud onRamp for SaaS activity for the application, including the following:
Field
Description
vQoE Status
A green checkmark indicates that the vQoE score for the best path meets the criteria of an acceptable connection. The vQoE is calculated based on average loss and average latency. For Office 365 traffic, other connection metrics are also factored in to the vQoE score.
vQoE Score
For each site, this is the vQoE score of the best available path for the cloud application traffic.
The vQoE score is determined by the Cloud onRamp for SaaS probe. Depending on the type of routers at the site, you can view details of the vQoE Score as follows:
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices:
To show a chart of the vQoE score history for each available interface, click the chart icon. In the chart, each interface vQoE score history is presented as a colored line. A solid line indicates that Cloud onRamp for SaaS has designated the interface as the best path for the cloud application at the given time on the chart.
You can place the cursor over a line, at a particular time on the chart, to view details of the vQoE score of an interface at that time.
From Cisco vManage Release 20.8.1, for the Office 365 application, the chart includes an option to show the vQoE score history for a specific service area, such as Exchange, Sharepoint, or Skype. For each service area, a solid line in the chart indicates the interface chosen as the best path at a given time. If you have enabled Cloud onRamp for SaaS to use Microsoft traffic metrics for Office 365 traffic, the choice of best path takes into account the Microsoft traffic metrics.
Cisco vEdge devices:
To show a chart of the vQoE score history, click the chart icon. The chart shows the vQoE score for the best path chosen by Cloud onRamp for SaaS.
DIA Status
The type of connection to the internet, such as local (from the site), or through a gateway site.
Selected Interface
The interface providing the best path for the cloud application.
Note 
If the DIA status is Gateway, this field displays N/A.
Activated Gateway
For a site that connects to the internet through a gateway site, this indicates the IP address of the gateway site.
Note 
If the DIA status is Local, this field displays N/A.
Local Color
For a site that connects to the internet through a gateway site, this is the local color identifier of the tunnel used to connect to the gateway site.
Note 
If the DIA status is Local, this field displays N/A.
Remote Color
For a site that connects to the internet through a gateway site, this is the remote (gateway site) color identifier of the tunnel used to connect to the gateway site.
Note 
If the DIA status is Local, this field displays N/A.
SDWAN Computed Score
This field is applicable only if the site uses Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. It does not apply for Cisco vEdge devices.
From Cisco vManage Release 20.8.1, for the Microsoft Office 365 application, an SDWAN Computed Score column provides links to view charts of the path scores (OK, NOT-OK, or INIT) provided by Microsoft telemetry for each Microsoft service area, including Exchange, Sharepoint, and Skype. The chart shows the scores over time for each available interface. The scores are defined as follows:
OK: Acceptable path
NOT-OK: Unacceptable path
INIT: Insufficient data
These charts provide visibility into how Cloud onRamp for SaaS chooses a best path for each type of Microsoft Office 365 traffic.
A use case for viewing the path score history is for determining whether Microsoft consistently rates a particular interface as NOT-OK for some types of traffic, such as Skype traffic.
