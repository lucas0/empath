•System management
•Interfaces
•Fabric
•Quality of service
•Security

The information in these new guides previously existed in the Cisco MDS 9000 Family CLI Configuration Guide and in the Cisco MDS 9000 Family Fabric Manager Configuration Guide. Those configuration guides remain available on Cisco.com and should be used for all software releases prior to MDS NX-OS Release 4.2(1). Each guide addresses the features introduced in or available in a particular release. Select and view the configuration guide that pertains to the software installed in your switch.
Some information from the Cisco MDS 9000 Family CLI Configuration Guide and the Cisco MDS 9000 Family Fabric Manager Configuration Guide now appears in the following guides that are common among products that run the Nexus operating system:
•Cisco NX-OS Family Licensing Guide - Explains the licensing model and describes the feature licenses.
•Cisco NX-OS Fundamentals Configuration Guide - Describes the switch setup utility and includes general CLI, file system, and configuration information.
