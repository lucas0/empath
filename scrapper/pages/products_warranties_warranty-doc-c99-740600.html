  Cisco Small Business Product 3-Year Limited Hardware Warranty Terms
The following are terms applicable to your hardware warranty. Your embedded software is subject to the Cisco EULA (link available below) and/or any SEULA or specific Software warranty terms for additional software products loaded on the device.
Duration of Hardware Warranty: Three (3) Years
Replacement, Repair or Refund Procedure for Hardware: Cisco or its service center will use commercially reasonable efforts to ship a replacement part for delivery upon receipt of the defective product at Cisco's site. The replacement part will be shipped via ground shipping with shipping charges prepaid. Actual delivery times may vary depending on Customer location.
Cisco reserves the right to refund the purchase price as its exclusive warranty remedy.
Limited Hardware Warranty
Hardware. Cisco Systems, Inc., or the Cisco Systems, Inc. subsidiary selling the Product ("Cisco") warrants that commencing from the date of shipment to Customer (and in case of resale by a Cisco reseller, commencing not more than ninety (90) days after original shipment by Cisco), and continuing for a period of the longer of (a) ninety (90) days or (b) as otherwise set forth at https://cisco.com/go/warranty, the Hardware will be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use. The date of shipment of a Product by Cisco is set forth on the packaging material in which the Product is shipped. This limited warranty extends only to the original user of the Product. Customer's sole and exclusive remedy and the entire liability of Cisco and its suppliers under this limited warranty will be, at Cisco's or its service center's option, shipment of a replacement within the warranty period and according to the replacement process described in the warranty card (if any), or if no warranty card, as described on the Cisco Product Warranties web page https://www.cisco.com/go/warranty or a refund of the purchase price if the Hardware is returned to the party supplying it to Customer, freight and insurance prepaid. Cisco replacement parts used in Hardware replacement may be new or equivalent to new. Cisco's obligations hereunder are conditioned upon the return of affected Hardware in accordance with Cisco's or its service center's then-current Return Material Authorization (RMA) procedures.
Restrictions. This limited warranty does not apply if the Hardware (a) has been altered, except by Cisco or its authorized representative, (b) has not been installed, operated, repaired, or maintained in accordance with instructions supplied by Cisco, (c) has been subjected to abnormal physical or electrical stress, abnormal environmental conditions, misuse, negligence, or accident; or (d) is licensed for beta, evaluation, testing or demonstration purposes.
DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN THIS LIMITED WARRANTY, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, NON-INTERFERENCE, ACCURACY OF INFORMATIONAL CONTENT, OR ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, LAW, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE, ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED BY CISCO, ITS SUPPLIERS AND LICENSORS. TO THE EXTENT AN IMPLIED WARRANTY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, SUCH WARRANTY IS LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE EXPRESS WARRANTY PERIOD. BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY. THESE WARRANTIES GIVE CUSTOMER SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND CUSTOMER MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. This disclaimer and exclusion shall apply even if the express warranty set forth above fails of its essential purpose.
Limitations and Exclusions of Liability. In no event will Cisco or its licensors be liable for the following, regardless of the theory of liability or whether arising out of the use or inability to use the Hardware or otherwise, even if a party been advised of the possibility of such damages: (a) indirect, incidental, exemplary, special or consequential damages; (b) loss or corruption of data or interrupted or loss of business; or (c) loss of revenue, profits, goodwill or anticipated sales or savings. All liability of Cisco, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, suppliers and licensors collectively, to Customer, whether based in warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, shall not exceed the license fees paid by Customer to any Approved Source for the Hardware that gave rise to the claim. This limitation of liability for Hardware is cumulative and not per incident. Nothing in this limited warranty limits or excludes any liability that cannot be limited or excluded under applicable law.
Duration of Software Warranty: One (1) Year
Software: Cisco warrants that commencing from the date of shipment to Customer (but in case of resale by an authorized Cisco reseller, commencing not more than ninety (90) days after original shipment by Cisco), and continuing for a period of one (1) year: (a) the media on which the Software is furnished will be free of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use; and (b) the Software substantially conforms to its published specifications.
Cisco reserves the right to refund the purchase price as its exclusive warranty remedy.
