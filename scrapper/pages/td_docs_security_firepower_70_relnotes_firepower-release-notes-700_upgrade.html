FXOS 2.10.1.159 is required for the Firepower 4100/9300. In most cases, we recommend you use the latest FXOS build in each major version. To help you decide, see the Cisco Firepower 4100/9300 FXOS Release Notes, 2.10(1).
ASA with FirePOWER Services
6.4
See Device Platforms for ASA requirements for your model. Although there is wide compatibility between ASA and ASA FirePOWER versions, upgrading allows you to take advantage of new features and resolved issues. To help you decide, see the Cisco Secure Firewall ASA Release Notes.
NGIPSv
6.4
Minimum Version to Patch
Patches change the fourth digit only. You cannot upgrade directly to a patch from a previous major or maintenance release.
Guidelines for Cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center
You do not upgrade the cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center. It does not have a version and we take care of feature updates.
Upgrading FTD with Cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center
To upgrade FTD with the cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center, use the latest released version of the Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Upgrade Guide for Firepower Management Center.

Note
The cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center cannot manage FTD Version 7.1. You cannot upgrade a cloud-managed device from Version 7.0 to Version 7.1 unless you unregister and disable cloud management. We recommend you upgrade the device directly to Version 7.2+.
Upgrading Co-Managed Devices
Customer-deployed FMCs running Version 7.2+ can co-manage cloud-managed FTD devices, but for event logging and analytics purposes only. You must use the cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center to manage and configure all other aspects of FTD, including upgrade.
Remember, a customer-deployed FMC must run the same or newer version as its managed devices—and this includes devices co-managed by the cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center. That is, you cannot use the cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center to upgrade a co-managed device past its customer-deployed FMC.
For example, consider a threat defense device with two managers:
Device, running Version A.
Customer-deployed FMC, running Version B.
Cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center, no version.
In this scenario, you can use the cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center to upgrade the device to Version B (the same version as the co-manager), but not to Version C (past the co-manager).
Upgrade Guidelines for Version 7.0
These checklists provide new and/or previously published upgrade guidelines that may apply to you.

Reconnect with Cisco Threat Grid for High Availability FMCs
Deployments: High availability/AMP for Networks (malware detection) deployments where you submit files for dynamic analysis
Upgrading from: Version 6.4.0 through 6.7.x
Directly to: Version 7.0.0+
Related bug: CSCvu35704
Version 7.0.0 fixes an issue with high availability where, after failover, the system stopped submitting files for dynamic analysis. For the fix to take effect, you must reassociate with the Cisco Threat Grid public cloud.
After you upgrade the high availability pair, on the primary FMC:
Choose AMP > Dynamic Analysis Connections.
Click Associate in the table row corresponding to the public cloud.
A portal window opens. You do not have to sign in. The reassociation happens in the background, within a few minutes.
Upgrade Failure: Firepower 1010 Switch Ports with Invalid VLAN IDs
Deployments: Firepower 1010
Upgrading from: Version 6.4 through 6.6
Directly to: Version 6.7+
For the Firepower 1010, FTD upgrades to Version 6.7+ will fail if you configured switch ports with a VLAN ID in the 3968–4047 range. These IDs are for internal use only.
FMCv Requires 28 GB RAM for Upgrade
Deployments: FMCv
Upgrading from: Version 6.2.3 through 6.5
Directly to: Version 6.6+
All FMCv implementations now have the same RAM requirements: 32 GB recommended, 28 GB required (64 GB for FMCv 300). Upgrades to Version 6.6+ will fail if you allocate less than 28 GB to the virtual appliance. After upgrade, the health monitor will alert if you lower the memory allocation.
These new memory requirements enforce uniform requirements across all virtual environments, improve performance, and allow you to take advantage of new features and functionality. We recommend you do not decrease the default settings. To improve performance, you can increase a virtual appliance’s memory and number of CPUs, depending on your available resources. For details, see the Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center Virtual Getting Started Guide.

Note
As of the Version 6.6.0 release, lower-memory instance types for cloud-based FMCv deployments (AWS, Azure) are fully deprecated. You cannot create new instances using them, even for earlier versions. You can continue running existing instances.
This table summarizes pre-upgrade requirements for lower-memory deployments.
Table 5. FMCv Memory Requirements for Version 6.6+ Upgrades
Platform
Pre-Upgrade Action
Details
VMware
Allocate 28 GB minimum/32 GB recommended.
Power off the virtual machine first.
For instructions, see the VMware documentation.
KVM
Allocate 28 GB minimum/32 GB recommended.
For instructions, see the documentation for your KVM environment.
AWS
Resize instances:
From c3.xlarge to c3.4xlarge.
From c3.2.xlarge to c3.4xlarge.
From c4.xlarge to c4.4xlarge.
From c4.2xlarge to c4.4xlarge.
We also offer a c5.4xlarge instance for new deployments.
Stop the instance before you resize. Note that when you do this, data on the instance store volume is lost, so migrate your instance store-backed instance first. Additionally, if your management interface does not have an Elastic IP address, its public IP address is released.
For instructions, see the documentation on changing your instance type in the AWS user guide for Linux instances.
Azure
Resize instances:
From Standard_D3_v2 to Standard_D4_v2.
Use the Azure portal or PowerShell. You do not need to stop the instance before you resize, but stopping may reveal additional sizes. Resizing restarts a running virtual machine.
For instructions, see the Azure documentation on resizing a Windows VM.
Firepower 1000 Series Devices Require Post-Upgrade Power Cycle
Deployments: Firepower 1000 series
Upgrading from: Version 6.4.0.x
Directly to: Version 6.5.0+
Version 6.5.0 introduces an FXOS CLI 'secure erase' feature for Firepower 1000/2100 and Firepower 4100/9300 series devices.
For Firepower 1000 series devices, you must power cycle the device after you upgrade to Version 6.5.0+ for this feature to work properly. The automatic reboot is not sufficient. Other supported devices do not require the power cycle.
Historical Data Removed During FTD Upgrade with FDM
Deployments: FTD with FDM
Upgrading from: Version 6.2.3 through 6.4.0.x
Directly to: 6.5.0+
All historical report data is removed during the upgrade due to a database schema change. After the upgrade, you cannot query historical data, nor view historical data in dashboards.
New URL Categories and Reputations
Deployments: Any
Upgrading from: Version 6.2.3 through 6.4.0.x
Directly to: Version 6.5.0+
Talos Intelligence Group has introduced new categories and renamed reputations to classify and filter URLs. For detailed lists of category changes, see the Cisco Firepower Release Notes, Version 6.5.0. For descriptions of the new URL categories, see the Talos Intelligence Categories site.
Also new are the concepts of uncategorized and reputationless URLs, although rule configuration options stay the same:
Uncategorized URLs can have a Questionable, Neutral, Favorable, or Trusted reputation.
You can filter Uncategorized URLs but you cannot further constrain by reputation. These rules will match all uncategorized URLs, regardless of reputation.
Note that there is no such thing as an Untrusted rule with no category. Otherwise uncategorized URLs with an Untrusted reputation are automatically assigned to the new Malicious Sites threat category.
Reputationless URLs can belong to any category.
You cannot filter reputationless URLs. There is no option in the rule editor for 'no reputation.' However, you can filter URLs with Any reputation, which includes reputationless URLs. These URLs must also be constrained by category. There is no utility to an Any/Any rule.
The following table summarizes the changes on upgrade. Although they are designed for minimal impact and will not prevent post-upgrade deploy for most customers, we strongly recommend you review these release notes and your current URL filtering configuration. Careful planning and preparation can help you avoid missteps, as well as reduce the time you spend troubleshooting post-upgrade.
Table 6. Deployment Changes on Upgrade
Change
Details
Modifies URL rule categories.
The upgrade modifies URL rules to use the nearest equivalents in the new category set, in the following policies:
Access control
SSL
QoS (FMC only)
Correlation (FMC only)
These changes may create redundant or preempted rules, which can slow performance. If your configuration includes merged categories, you may experience minor changes to the URLs that are allowed or blocked.
Renames URL rule reputations.
The upgrade modifies URL rules to use the new reputation names:
Untrusted (was High Risk)
Questionable (was Suspicious sites)
Neutral (was Benign sites with security risks)
Favorable (was Benign sites)
Trusted (was Well Known)
Clears the URL cache.
The upgrade clears the URL cache, which contains results that the system previously looked up in the cloud. Your users may temporarily experience slightly longer access times for URLs that are not in the local data set.
Labels 'legacy' events.
For already-logged events, the upgrade labels any associated URL category and reputation information as Legacy. These legacy events will age out of the database over time.
Pre-Upgrade Actions for URL Categories and Reputations
Before upgrade, take the following actions.
Table 7. Pre-Upgrade Actions
Action
Details
Make sure your appliances can reach Talos resources.
The system must be able to communicate with the following Cisco resources after the upgrade:
https://regsvc.sco.cisco.com/ — Registration
https://est.sco.cisco.com/ — Obtain certificates for secure communications
https://updates-talos.sco.cisco.com/ — Obtain client/server manifests
http://updates.ironport.com/ — Download database (note: uses port 80)
https://v3.sds.cisco.com/ — Cloud queries
The cloud query service also uses the following IP address blocks:
IPv4 cloud queries:
146.112.62.0/24
146.112.63.0/24
146.112.255.0/24
146.112.59.0/24
IPv6 cloud queries:
2a04:e4c7:ffff::/48
2a04:e4c7:fffe::/48
Identify potential rule issues.
Understand the upcoming changes. Examine your current URL filtering configuration and determine what post-upgrade actions you will need to take (see the next section).
Note
  You may want to modify URL rules that use deprecated categories now. Otherwise, rules that use them will prevent deploy after the upgrade.
In FMC deployments, we recommend you generate an access control policy report, which provides details on the policy's current saved configuration, including access control rules and rules in subordinate policies (such as SSL). For each URL rule, you can see the current categories, reputations, and associated rule actions. On the FMC, choose Policies > Access Control, then click the report icon () next to the appropriate policy.
Post-Upgrade Actions for URL Categories and Reputations
After upgrade, you should reexamine your URL filtering configuration and take the following actions as soon as possible. Depending on deployment type and the changes made by the upgrade, some — but not all — issues may be marked in the GUI. For example, in access control policies on FMC/FDM, you can click Show Warnings (FMC) or Show Problem Rules (FDM).
Table 8. Post-Upgrade Actions
Action
Details
Remove deprecated categories from rules. Required.
The upgrade does not modify URL rules that use deprecated categories. Rules that use them will prevent deploy.
On the FMC, these rules are marked.
Create or modify rules to include the new categories.
Most of the new categories identify threats. We strongly recommend you use them.
On the FMC, these new categories are not marked after this upgrade, but Talos may add additional categories in the future. When that happens, new categories are marked.
Evaluate rules changed as a result of merged categories.
Each rule that included any of the affected categories now include all of the affected categories. If the original categories were associated with different reputations, the new rule is associated with the broader, more inclusive reputation. To filter URLs as before, you may have to modify or delete some configurations; see Guidelines for Rules with Merged URL Categories.
Depending on what changed and how your platform handles rule warnings, changes may be marked. For example, the FMC marks wholly redundant and wholly preempted rules, but not rules that have partial overlap.
Evaluate rules changed as a result of split categories.
The upgrade replaces each old, single category in URL rules with all the new categories that map to the old one. This will not change the way you filter URLs, but you can modify affected rules to take advantage of the new granularity.
These changes are not marked.
Understand which categories were renamed or are unchanged.
Although no action is required, you should be aware of these changes.
These changes are not marked.
Evaluate how you handle uncategorized and reputationless URLs.
Even though it is now possible to have uncategorized and reputationless URLs, you cannot still cannot filter uncategorized URLs by reputation, nor can you filter reputationless URLs.
Make sure that rules that filter by the Uncategorized category, or by Any reputation, will behave as you expect.
Guidelines for Rules with Merged URL Categories
When you examine your URL filtering configuration before the upgrade, determine which of the following scenarios and guidelines apply to you. This will ensure that your post-upgrade configuration is as you expect, and that you can take quick action to resolve any issues.
Table 9. Guidelines for Rules with Merged URL Categories
Guideline
Details
Rule Order Determines Which Rule Matches Traffic
When considering rules that include the same category, remember that traffic matches the first rule in the list that includes the condition.
Categories in the Same Rule vs Categories in Different Rules
Merging categories in a single rule will merge into a single category in the rule. For example, if Category A and Category B are merging to become Category AB, and you have a rule with both Category A and Category B, then after merge the rule will have a single Category AB.
Merging categories in different rules will result in separate rules with the same category in each rule after the merge. For example, if Category A and Category B are merging to become Category AB, and you have Rule 1 with Category A and Rule 2 with Category B, then after merge Rule 1 and Rule 2 will each include Category AB. How you choose to resolve this situation depends on the rule order, on the actions and reputation levels associated with the rules, on the other URL categories included in the rule, and on the non-URL conditions that are included in the rule.
Associated Action
If merged categories in different rules were associated with different actions, then after merge you may have two or more rules with different actions for the same category.
Associated Reputation Level
If a single rule includes categories that were associated with different reputation levels before merging, the merged category will be associated with the more inclusive reputation level. For example, if Category A was associated in a particular rule with Any reputation and Category B was associated in the same rule with reputation level 3 - Benign sites with security risks, then after merge Category AB in that rule will be associated with Any reputation.
Duplicate and Redundant Categories and Rules
After merge, different rules may have the same category associated with different actions and reputation levels.
Redundant rules may not be exact duplicates, but they may no longer match traffic if another rule earlier in the rule order matches instead. For example, if you have pre-merge Rule 1 with Category A that applies to Any Reputation, and Rule 2 with Category B that applies only to Reputation 1-3, then after merge, both Rule 1 and Rule 2 will have Category AB, but Rule 2 will never match if Rule 1 is higher in the rule order.
On the FMC, rules with an identical category and reputation will show a warning. However, these warnings will not indicate rules that include the same category but a different reputation.
Caution: Consider all conditions in the rule when determining how to resolve duplicate or redundant categories.
Other URL Categories in a Rule
Rules with merged URLs may also include other URL categories. Therefore, if a particular category is duplicated after merge, you may want to modify rather than delete these rules.
Non-URL Conditions in a Rule
Rules with merged URL categories may also include other rule conditions, such as application conditions. Therefore, if a particular category is duplicated after merge, you may want to modify rather than delete these rules.
The examples in the following table use Category A and Category B, now merged into Category AB. In two-rule examples, Rule 1 comes before Rule 2.
Table 10. Examples of Rules with Merged URL Categories
Scenario
Before Upgrade
After Upgrade
Merged categories in the same rule
Rule 1 has Category A and Category B.
Rule 1 has Category AB.
Merged categories in different rules
Rule 1 has Category A.
Rule 2 has Category B.
Rule 1 has Category AB.
Rule 2 has Category AB.
The specific result varies by the rules' order in the list, reputation levels, and associated actions. You should also consider all other conditions in the rule when determining how to resolve any redundancy.
Merged categories in different rules have different actions
(Reputation is the same)
Rule 1 has Category A set to Allow.
Rule 2 has Category B set to Block.
(Reputation is the same)
Rule 1 has Category AB set to Allow.
Rule 2 has Category AB set to Block.
Rule 1 will match all traffic for this category.
Rule 2 will never match traffic, and will display a warning indicator if you show warnings after merge, because both category and reputation are the same.
Merged categories in the same rule have different reputation levels
Rule 1 includes:
Category A with Reputation Any
Category B with Reputation 1-3
Rule 1 includes Category AB with Reputation Any.
Merged categories in different rules have different reputation levels
Rule 1 includes Category A with Reputation Any.
Rule 2 includes Category B with Reputation 1-3.
Rule 1 includes Category AB with Reputation Any.
Rule 2 includes Category AB with Reputation 1-3.
Rule 1 will match all traffic for this category.
Rule 2 will never match traffic, but you will not see a warning indicator because the reputations are not identical.
Upgrade Guidelines for FXOS
For the Firepower 4100/9300, major FTD upgrades also require an FXOS upgrade.
Major FTD versions have a specially qualified and recommended companion FXOS version. Use these combinations whenever possible because we perform enhanced testing for them. Maintenance release and patches rarely require FXOS upgrades, but you may still want to upgrade to the latest FXOS build to take advantage of resolved issues.
We also recommend the latest firmware; see the Cisco Firepower 4100/9300 FXOS Firmware Upgrade Guide.
For critical and release-specific upgrade guidelines, new and deprecated features, and open and resolved bugs, see the Cisco Firepower 4100/9300 FXOS Release Notes.
Minimum FXOS Version to Upgrade FTD
The minimum FXOS version to run Version 7.0 is FXOS 2.10.1.159.
Minimum FXOS Version to Upgrade FXOS
You can upgrade to any later FXOS version from as far back as FXOS 2.2.2.
Time to Upgrade FXOS
An FXOS upgrade can take up to 45 minutes and can affect traffic flow and inspection. For more information, see Traffic Flow and Inspection for FXOS Upgrades.
Unresponsive Upgrades
Do not make or deploy configuration changes during upgrade. Even if the system appears inactive, do not manually reboot or shut down during upgrade. You could place the system in an unusable state and require a reimage.
Unresponsive FMC or Classic Device Upgrade
Do not restart an upgrade in progress. If you encounter issues with the upgrade, including a failed upgrade or unresponsive appliance, contact Cisco TAC.
Unresponsive FTD Upgrade
For major and maintenance upgrades, you can manually cancel failed or in-progress upgrades, and retry failed upgrades:
FMC: Use the Upgrade Status pop-up, accessible from the Upgrade tab on the Device Management page, and from the Message Center.
FDM: Use the System Upgrade panel.
You can also use the FTD CLI.

Note
By default, FTD automatically reverts to its pre-upgrade state upon upgrade failure ("auto-cancel"). To be able to manually cancel or retry a failed upgrade, disable the auto-cancel option when you initiate the upgrade. Auto-cancel is not supported for patches. In a high availability/scalability deployment, auto-cancel applies to each device individually. That is, if the upgrade fails on one device, only that device is reverted.
This feature is not supported for patches or for upgrades from Version 6.6 and earlier.
Revert or Uninstall the Upgrade
If an upgrade succeeds but the system does not function to your expectations, you may be able to revert or uninstall:
Revert is supported for major and maintenance upgrades to FTD with FDM.
See System Management in the FDM configuration guide.
Uninstall is supported for most patches in FMC and ASDM deployments.
See Uninstall a Patch in the FMC upgrade guide, or Uninstall ASA FirePOWER Patches with ASDM in these release notes.
If this will not work for you and you still need to return to an earlier version, you must reimage.
Uninstall ASA FirePOWER Patches with ASDM
Uninstall ASA FirePOWER Patches with ASDM
Use the Linux shell (expert mode) to uninstall device patches. You must have access to the device shell as the admin user for the device, or as another local user with CLI configuration access. If you disabled shell access, contact Cisco TAC to reverse the lockdown.
For ASA failover pairs and clusters, minimize disruption by uninstalling from one appliance at a time. Wait until the patch has fully uninstalled from one unit before you move on to the next.
Table 11. Uninstall Order for ASA with FirePOWER Services in ASA Failover Pairs/Clusters
Configuration
Uninstall Order
ASA active/standby failover pair, with ASA FirePOWER
Always uninstall from the standby.
Uninstall from the ASA FirePOWER module on the standby ASA device.
Fail over.
Uninstall from the ASA FirePOWER module on the new standby ASA device.
ASA active/active failover pair, with ASA FirePOWER
Make both failover groups active on the unit you are not uninstalling.
Make both failover groups active on the primary ASA device.
Uninstall from the ASA FirePOWER module on the secondary ASA device.
Make both failover groups active on the secondary ASA device.
Uninstall from the ASA FirePOWER module on the primary ASA device.
ASA cluster, with ASA FirePOWER
Disable clustering on each unit before you uninstall. Uninstall from one unit at a time, leaving the control unit for last.
On a data unit, disable clustering.
Uninstall from the ASA FirePOWER module on that unit.
Reenable clustering. Wait for the unit to rejoin the cluster.
Repeat for each data unit.
On the control unit, disable clustering. Wait for a new control unit to take over.
Uninstall from the ASA FirePOWER module on the former control unit.
Reenable clustering.

Caution
Do not make or deploy configuration changes during uninstall. Even if the system appears inactive, do not manually reboot, shut down, or restart an uninstall in progress. You could place the system in an unusable state and require a reimage. If you encounter issues with the uninstall, including a failed uninstall or unresponsive appliance, contact Cisco TAC.
Before you begin
In ASA failover/cluster deployments, make sure you are uninstalling from the correct device.
Make sure your deployment is healthy and successfully communicating.
Procedure
Step 1
If the device's configurations are out of date, deploy now from ASDM.
Deploying before you uninstall reduces the chance of failure. Make sure the deployment and other essential tasks are completed. Tasks running when the uninstall begins are stopped, become failed tasks, and cannot be resumed. You can manually delete failed status messages later.
Step 2
Access the Firepower CLI on the ASA FirePOWER module. Log in as admin or another Firepower CLI user with configuration access.
You can either SSH to the module's management interface (hostname or IP address) or use the console. Note that the console port defaults to the ASA CLI and you must use the session sfr command to access the Firepower CLI.
Step 3
Use the expert command to access the Linux shell.
Step 4
Verify the uninstall package is in the upgrade directory.
ls /var/sf/updates
Patch uninstallers are named like upgrade packages, but have Patch_Uninstaller instead of Patch in the file name. When you patch a device, the uninstaller for that patch is automatically created in the upgrade directory. If the uninstaller is not there, contact Cisco TAC.
Step 5
Run the uninstall command, entering your password when prompted.
sudo install_update.pl --detach /var/sf/updates/uninstaller_name
Caution
  The system does not ask you to confirm. Entering this command starts the uninstall, which includes a device reboot. Interruptions in traffic flow and inspection during an uninstall are the same as the interruptions that occur during an upgrade. Make sure you are ready. Note that using the --detach option ensures the uninstall process is not killed if your SSH session times out, which can leave the device in an unstable state.
Step 6
Monitor the uninstall until you are logged out.
For a detached uninstall, use tail or tailf to display logs:
tail /ngfw/var/log/sf/update.status
Otherwise, monitor progress in the console or terminal.
Step 7
Verify uninstall success.
After the uninstall completes, confirm that the module has the correct software version. Choose Configuration > ASA FirePOWER Configurations > Device Management > Device.
Step 8
Redeploy configurations.
What to do next
In ASA failover/cluster deployments, repeat this procedure for each unit in your planned sequence.
Traffic Flow and Inspection
Device upgrades (software and operating system) affect traffic flow and inspection. Schedule maintenance windows when this will have the least impact.

Traffic Flow and Inspection for FXOS Upgrades
Upgrading FXOS reboots the chassis. Even in high availability/scalability deployments, you upgrade FXOS on each chassis independently. To minimize disruption, upgrade one chassis at a time.

Traffic Flow and Inspection for FTD Upgrades with FMC
Software Upgrades for Standalone Devices
Devices operate in maintenance mode while they upgrade. Entering maintenance mode at the beginning of the upgrade causes a 2-3 second interruption in traffic inspection. Interface configurations determine how a standalone device handles traffic both then and during the upgrade.

For bridge group interfaces on the ISA 3000 only, you can use a FlexConfig policy to configure hardware bypass for power failure. This causes traffic to drop during software upgrades but pass without inspection while the device completes its post-upgrade reboot.
IPS-only interfaces
Inline set, hardware bypass force-enabled: Bypass: Force
Passed without inspection until you either disable hardware bypass, or set it back to standby mode.
Inline set, hardware bypass standby mode: Bypass: Standby
Dropped during the upgrade, while the device is in maintenance mode. Then, passed without inspection while the device completes its post-upgrade reboot.
Inline set, hardware bypass disabled: Bypass: Disabled
Dropped.
Inline set, no hardware bypass module.

Inline set, tap mode.
Egress packet immediately, copy not inspected.
Passive, ERSPAN passive.
Uninterrupted, not inspected.
Software Upgrades for High Availability/Scalability
You should not experience interruptions in traffic flow or inspection while upgrading high availability or clustered devices. For high availability pairs, the standby device upgrades first. The devices switch roles, then the new standby upgrades.
For clusters, the data security module or modules upgrade first, then the control module. During the control security module upgrade, although traffic inspection and handling continues normally, the system stops logging events. Events for traffic processed during the logging downtime appear with out-of-sync timestamps after the upgrade is completed. However, if the logging downtime is significant, the system may prune the oldest events before they can be logged.
Software Uninstall (Patches)
For standalone devices, interruptions to traffic flow and inspection during patch uninstall are the same as for upgrade. In high availability/scalability deployments, you must explicitly plan an uninstall order that minimizes disruption. This is because you uninstall patches from devices individually, even those that you upgraded as a unit.
Deploying Configuration Changes
Restarting the Snort process briefly interrupts traffic flow and inspection on all devices, including those configured for high availability/scalability. Interface configurations determine whether traffic drops or passes without inspection during the interruption. When you deploy without restarting Snort, resource demands may result in a small number of packets dropping without inspection.
Snort typically restarts during the first deployment immediately after the upgrade. It does not restart during other deployments unless, before deploying, you modify specific policy or device configurations.

Traffic Flow and Inspection for FTD Upgrades with FDM
Software Upgrades
Traffic is dropped while you upgrade. In a high availability deployment, you can minimize disruption by upgrading devices one at a time.
For the ISA 3000 only, if you configured hardware bypass for power failure, traffic is dropped during the upgrade but is passed without inspection while the device completes its post-upgrade reboot.
Software Revert (Major/Maintenance Releases)
Traffic is dropped while you revert. In a high availability deployment, revert is more successful when you revert both units simultaneously. Traffic flow and inspection resume when the first unit comes back online.
Deploying Configuration Changes
Restarting the Snort process briefly interrupts traffic flow and inspection on all devices, including those configured for high availability. When you deploy without restarting Snort, resource demands may result in a small number of packets dropping without inspection.
Snort typically restarts during the first deployment immediately after the upgrade. It does not restart during other deployments unless, before deploying, you modify specific policy or device configurations.
Traffic Flow and Inspection for ASA FirePOWER Upgrades
Software Upgrades
Your ASA service policies for redirecting traffic to the ASA FirePOWER module determine how the module handles traffic during software upgrade.

Software Uninstall (Patches)
Interruptions to traffic flow and inspection during patch uninstall are the same as for upgrade. In ASA failover/cluster deployments, you must explicitly plan an uninstall order that minimizes disruption. This is because you uninstall patches from devices individually, even those that you upgraded as a unit.
Deploying Configuration Changes
Restarting the Snort process briefly interrupts traffic flow and inspection. Traffic behavior while the Snort process restarts is the same as when you upgrade ASA FirePOWER. When you deploy without restarting Snort, resource demands may result in a small number of packets dropping without inspection.
Snort typically restarts during the first deployment immediately after the upgrade. It does not restart during other deployments unless, before deploying, you modify specific policy or device configurations.

Time and Disk Space Tests
For reference purposes, we provide reports of in-house time and disk space tests for FMC and device software upgrades.
Time Tests
We report the slowest tested time of all software upgrades tested on a particular platform/series. Your upgrade will likely take longer than the provided times for multiple reasons, as explained in the following table. We recommend you track and record your own upgrade times so you can use them as future benchmarks.

Caution
Do not make or deploy configuration changes during upgrade. Even if the system appears inactive, do not manually reboot or shut down. In most cases, do not restart an upgrade in progress. You could place the system in an unusable state and require a reimage. If you encounter issues with the upgrade, including a failed upgrade or unresponsive appliance, see Unresponsive Upgrades.
Table 18. Time Test Conditions for Software Upgrades
Condition
Details
Deployment
Times for device upgrades are from tests in a FMC deployments. Raw upgrade times for remotely and locally managed devices are similar, given similar conditions.
Versions
For major and maintenance releases, we test upgrades from all eligible previous major versions. For patches, we test upgrades from the base version. Upgrade time usually increases if your upgrade skips versions.
Models
In most cases, we test on the lowest-end models in each series, and sometimes on multiple models in a series.
Virtual appliances
We test with the default settings for memory and resources. However, note that upgrade time in virtual deployments is highly hardware dependent.
High availability/scalability
Unless otherwise noted, we test on standalone devices.
In a high availability or clustered configuration, devices upgrade one at a time to preserve continuity of operations, with each device operating in maintenance mode while it upgrades. Upgrading a device pair or entire cluster, therefore, takes longer than upgrading a standalone device.
Configurations
We test on appliances with minimal configurations and traffic load.
Upgrade time can increase with the complexity of your configurations, size of event databases, and whether/how those things are affected by the upgrade. For example, if you use a lot of access control rules and the upgrade needs to make a backend change to how those rules are stored, the upgrade can take longer.
Components
We report times for the software upgrade itself and the subsequent reboot only. This does not include time for operating system upgrades, transferring upgrade packages, readiness checks, VDB and intrusion rule (SRU/LSP) updates, or deploying configurations.
Disk Space Tests
We report the most disk space used of all software upgrades tested on a particular platform/series. This includes the space needed to copy the upgrade package to the device.
We also report the space needed on the FMC (in either /Volume or /var) for the device upgrade package. If you have an internal server for FTD upgrade packages, or if you are using FDM, ignore those values.
When we report disk space estimates for a particular location (for example, /var or /ngfw), we are reporting the disk space estimate for the partition mounted in that location. On some platforms, these locations may be on the same partition.
Without enough free disk space, the upgrade fails.
