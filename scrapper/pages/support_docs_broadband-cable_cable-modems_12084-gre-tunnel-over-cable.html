Introduction
This document contains descriptions, configurations and verifications for Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) in a cable environment. GRE is a tunneling protocol developed by Cisco that encapsulates a wide variety of protocol packet types inside IP tunnels.

Prerequisites
There are no specific prerequisites for this document.
Components Used
The information in this document is based on the software and hardware versions below.
Cable Modem uBR924 running Cisco IOSÂ® Software Release 12.1(5)T4
Note: Although it is possible to configure GRE tunnels in other Cisco cable modem platforms, such as on the uBR904 using different Cisco IOS versions, the official support for this feature is on Cisco IOS 12.1(5)T4 for uBR920 and from Cisco IOS 12.1(3) for uBR910.
Cable Modem Platform Cisco IOS Software Release
uBR920 12.1(5)T4
uBR910 From 12.1(3) and later
To run this configuration, you need to have IP connectivity between the two cable modems.
The information presented in this document was created from devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If you are working in a live network, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command before using it.
Background Theory
Tunneling provides a way to encapsulate packets of a foreign protocol inside a transport protocol. Tunneling is implemented as a virtual interface to provide a simple interface for configuration. The tunnel interface is not tied to specific passenger or transport protocols, however, it is an architecture that is designed to provide the services necessary to implement any standard point-to-point encapsulation scheme. Tunnels are point-to-point links, and you must configure a separate tunnel for each link.
GRE creates a virtual point-to-point link to Cisco routers at remote points over an IP internetwork. By connecting multiprotocol subnetworks in a single-protocol backbone environment, IP tunneling using GRE allows network expansion across a single-protocol backbone environment. A Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS) is any Data-over-Cable Service Interface Specifications (DOCSIS)-compliant headend cable router, such as the Cisco uBR7246, uBR7223, or uBR7246VXR.
Configure
In this section, you are presented with the information to configure the features described in this document.
Network Diagram
This document uses the network setup shown in the diagram below.
This setup creates a tunnel between the two cable modems uBR924-ddd5 and uBR924-b5db. The example below uses two uBR924s and a uBR7246VXR. For this set up, the names of the cable modems are ubr924-ddd5 and ubr924-b5db, and they use Cisco IOS version 12.1(5)T4. The tunnel interfaces are dynamically created in global configuration mode by issuing the command interface tunnel 0.
Note: The uBR900 cable modems do not have to be connected to the same uBR7200 CMTS or the same service provider's network as long as there is IP connectivity between the two cable modems.
Configurations
This document uses the configurations shown below.

The tunnel will show up/up, as long as the following conditions exist:
It is configured with valid IP addresses.
There is a route in the routing table to the tunnel destination IP address, and not the IP address assigned to the far end of the tunnel.
This should be true regardless of whether you can ping the destination address. An incorrect static route or a default route pointing in the wrong direction will bring up the tunnel, however, the tunnel will not work.
The first step to verify that the tunnel works is to verify that the tunnel is up. Issue the show ip interface brief and show interface tunnel 0 commands on both cable modems. Sample command output is shown below.

Verify that the tunnel works is to ping the tunnel destination IP address. This will verify IP connectivity only, not the actual functioning of the tunnel.

To verify that the tunnel works, issue the show ip route x.x.x.x command, where x.x.x.x is the IP address assigned to the far end of the tunnel. In this case, it would be the loop-back address of the far router. If the only route shown is to the tunnel interface, a ping to that address will prove that the tunnel works.
If there is an IP addressing scheme that advertises routes to the tunnel segment back across the network, there would be more than one route to the far end of the tunnel interface. If that is the case, it is very difficult to verify that the tunnel is working. Typically in this situation, you do not want duplicate routes to the tunnel network. Steps should be taken to prevent the advertisement of the routes by a routing protocol across the network. If the tunnel is being used to transport traffic of a different protocol from IP, the same basic verification method applies.
From ubr924-ddd5 we get
ubr924-ddd5#show ip route 192.168.20.2
Routing entry for 192.168.20.0/24
  Known via "connected", distance 0, metric 0 (connected, via interface)
  Routing Descriptor Blocks:
  * directly connected, via Tunnel0
      Route metric is 0, traffic share count is 1

From ubr924-b5db we get
ubr924-b5db#show ip route 192.168.20.1 
Routing entry for 192.168.20.0/24
  Known via "connected", distance 0, metric 0 (connected, via interface)
  Routing Descriptor Blocks:
  * directly connected, via Tunnel0
      Route metric is 0, traffic share count is 1
To verify that PC1 can access PC2 and vice versa, perform extended pings on the cable modems, and also pings from the PCs .
Perform an extended ping on ubr924-b5db from its Ethernet interface (11.11.11.11) to the ubr924-ddd5's Ethernet interface (9.9.9.9).
ubr924-b5db#ping ip

The final test is to ping from PC1 to PC2, and PC2 to PC1.
PC1 has an IP address of 9.9.9.1.
PC2 has and IP address of 11.11.11.1.
Ping from PC1 to PC2.
Ping from PC2 to PC1.
