Installing the Cisco ONS 15216-MD-48-CM Interleaver and Deinterleaver Pluggable and the Cisco ONS 15216-MD-48-CME Coupler and Splitter Pluggable
This document explains how to install and operate the Cisco ONS 15216-MD-48-CM interleaver and deinterleaver pluggable and the Cisco ONS 15216-MD-48-CME coupler and splitter pluggable.
Overview of the Cisco ONS 15216-MD-48-CM and ONS 15216-MD-48-CME Pluggables
The Cisco ONS15216-MD-48-CM is 50 GHz/100 GHz C-band interleaver and deinterleaver pluggable that provides signal interleaving and deinterleaving in 50-GHz channel spacing DWDM systems. It operates inside the ONS 15216-MD-40, ONS 15216-EF-40, or ONS 15216-MD-48 odd and even patch panels.
The Cisco ONS15216-MD-48-CME is a bidirectional unit that has the MUX and the DEMUX functions implemented as two different sections. The DEMUX section includes an optical splitter to split the optical signal evenly into two different output ports: EVEN-TX port and ODD-TX port. The optical coupler provides the MUX section and combines even and odd channels signals at 100 GHz spacing (EVEN-RX and ODD-RX ports respectively) into a signal of 50 GHz channel spacing.
For installing the 15216-MD-40 patch panel, refer to the "Installing the Cisco ONS 15216-MD-40-ODD and 15216-MD-40-EVEN Mux/Demux Patch Panels" guide. For installing the 15216-EF-40 patch panel, refer to the "Installing the Cisco ONS 15216-EF-40-ODD and 15216-EF-40-EVEN Mux/Demux Patch Panels" guide. For installing the 15216-MD-48 patch panel, refer to the "Installing the Cisco ONS 15216-MD-48-ODD and 15216-MD-48-EVEN Mux/Demux Patch Panels"

Functional Description
ONS 15216-MD-48-CM Interleaver and Deinterleaver Pluggable
The ONS 15216-MD-48-CM pluggable increases the network capacity by combining two optical data streams into a single, more densely spaced stream. This pluggable can be used in mux mode to combine two 100 GHz optical signal streams into one 50 GHz stream, or in demux mode to separate the 50 GHz stream into two 100 GHz streams.
The ONS 15216-MD-48-CM is a bidirectional pluggable in which the mux and demux functions are implemented in two different sections to enable signals flowing in opposite directions to be managed separately. This functionality is illustrated in the following figure.
Figure 1. Functional Description of the ONS 15216-MD-48-CM Interleaver and Deinterleaver Pluggable

The interleaver (3dB optical coupler) in the mux section combines the even and odd channel signals at 100 GHz spacing (EVEN-RX and ODD-RX ports, respectively) into the 50 GHz channel spacing signal.
The deinterleaver in the demux section separates the 50 GHz channel spacing signal into even and odd channel signals of 100 GHz spacing (EVEN-TX and ODD-TX ports, respectively).
The interleaver and deinterleaver module is plugged inside the patch panel and is interconnected with another patch panel of a different grid (odd or even).

Step 1   To connect the fibers as appropriate (see the following figure):
Remove the LC adapter cap from the LC-LC adapter of the ONS 15216-MD-48-CM/15216-MD-48-CME pluggable .
Place the LC/UPC cable connector in front of the corresponding bulkhead adapter on the front panel of the ONS 15216-MD-48-CM/15216-MD-48-CME pluggable.
Align the keyed ridge of the cable connector with the slot in the receiving adapter.
Gently push the cable connector into the adapter until you hear a click, which indicates that the latching system is engaged.
Route the cables through the left or right fiber holder clip.
(Optional) Secure the fibers further by placing them into one or more adhesive clips. The adhesive clips can be placed on the fiber management plate as per the actual installation conditions.
Place the extra fiber length of the two LC-LC patch cords used to connect the patch panel with its plugged ONS 15216-MD-48-CM/15216-MD-48-CME module on the interleaver/deinterleaver or coupler/splitter fiber management bracket.
Note    The interleaver/deinterleaver or coupler/splitter fiber management bracket can be removed from the ONS 15216-MD-48-CM/15216-MD-48-CME pluggable and the extra fiber length of the two LC-LC patch cords can be routed outside the patch panel.
For interconnections between the ONS 15216-MD-48-CM/15216-MD-48-CME pluggables, odd or even patch panel with a patch panel of a different grid, see "Optical Interconnections".

Step 2   To secure the fibers, bundle the fibers using one of the four velcro strips that is provided.
Step 3   To connect and secure the inventory USB Type A plug connector to the inventory USB Type A receptacle connector (see Figure 1):
Route the inventory USB cable through the left or right fiber holder clip.
Connect the USB Type A plug connector to the USB Type A receptacle connector.
Secure the USB cable with a tie-wrap at one of the three available locations on the patch panel.
Uninstalling the ONS 15216-MD-48-CM/15216-MD-48-CME Pluggable
Procedure
Step 1   Gently disconnect the fiber-optic connectors from the LC-LC adapters of the ONS 15216-MD-48-CM/15216-MD-48-CME pluggable.
Step 2   Disconnect the inventory USB cable releasing it from the tie wrap and from the USB receptacle connector of the pluggable. Clear the front of the ONS 15216-MD-48-CM/15216-MD-48-CME pluggable from any cable or fiber.
Step 3   Unscrew the captive screws of the ONS 15216-MD-48-CM/15216-MD-48-CME pluggable.
Step 4   Remove the ONS 15216-MD-48-CM/15216-MD-48-CME pluggable from the patch panel.
Step 5   Close the empty space on the patch panel with the I/D blank cover.
Cleaning and Maintaining Fiber-Optic Connectors
Connector cleaning is required to maintain the performance of fiber-optic circuits. It is important that both the LC/UPC connector at the end of the fiber-optic cable and the optical mating adapter on the front panel of the device are clean before the connection is made.

Warning
Invisible laser radiation may be emitted from disconnected fibers or connectors. Do not stare into beams or view directly with optical instruments. Statement 1051
The following warning applies to disposal of chemicals and other materials used to clean connectors and adapters:

Warning
Ultimate disposal of this product should be handled according to all national laws and regulations. Statement 1040

Note
Before installing the fiber-optic cable, always perform the cleaning procedure for cable connectors described in the following section. Whenever possible, inspect each connector before connecting it to the optical mating adapter on the front panel.

Note
The LC optical mating adapter on the faceplate of the device is less likely to get dirty if it is capped when not in use. On some devices, the optical mating adapter has a shutter. The shutter automatically closes when the LC/UPC connector is disconnected. This prevents entry of dirt.
The procedure for a thorough cleaning of these adapters is complicated. Use a commercially available cleaning kit and closely follow the instructions included with the kit.
Customer-supplied Cleaning Materials
The Type A fiber optic connector cleaners (for example, CLETOP reel) are recommended to clean the cable connectors, but are not supplied with the device.
If properly maintained (only used with clean, defect-free fiber connectors and capped when not in use), the mating adapter would not require cleaning. However, if you suspect the adapter is dirty, clean it by using the CLETOP stick swab.

Note
For multifiber cable assemblies, use specific cleaning tools or materials designed for the assembly type.
Cleaning the Optical Mating Adapter
Procedure
Step 1   Read the cartridge cleaning instructions (provided by the manufacturer) to insert the cartridge cleaning tip into the optical mating adapter.
Step 2   Slide the lever on the cartridge to swipe the mating surface.
Note   
Always keep unused adapter ports and fiber connectors capped with a clean dust cap. The optical mating adapters that have shutter need not be capped.
Cleaning Fiber-Optic Cable Connectors
The tools required to clean fiber connectors are:
Inspection microscope
Type A Fiber Optic Connector Cleaner (CLETOP reel)
Optical swab
Optical receiver cleaning stick
Procedure
Step 1   Using an inspection microscope, inspect each fiber connector for dirt, cracks, or scratches.
Step 2   Replace any damaged fiber connectors.
Note    Replace all dust caps whenever the equipment is unused for 30 minutes or more.
Caution   
Do not reuse optical swabs. Keep unused swabs off of work surfaces.
Step 3   Clean the fiber connectors with CLETOP reel:
If present, remove the dust cap from the fiber connector.
Press the lever down to open the shutter door. Each time you press the lever, you expose a clean wiping surface.
Insert the connector into the CLETOP cleaning cassette slot, rotate one-quarter turn, and gently swipe downwards.
Use an inspection microscope to inspect each fiber connector for dirt, cracks, or scratches. If the connector is not clean, repeat the above sub-steps.
Insert the fiber connector into the applicable adapter or attach a dust cap to the fiber connector.
Note    Before replacing a dust cap on a connector, verify that the dust cap is clean. To clean the dust cap, wipe the outside of the cap using a dry, lint-free wipe and the inside of the dust cap using a CLETOP stick swab (14100400).
