Introduction
This document helps users to understand the behaviour of Address Conflict Detection (ACD - RFC 5277) with GLBP on Cisco Nexus Platforms.
Prerequisite
Cisco recommends that you have basic knowledge of first hop redundancy protocols such as HSRP, VRRP, GLBP, and Virtual port channel (vPC) concept, packet capture tools like ethanalyzer and ELAM on the Cisco Nexus platform.
Components Used
The information in this document is based on the Nexus platform.
The information in this document is created based on a specific internal lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a default configuration. If your network is live, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command to the existing traffic flow.
Topology
Observation
The ACD packets are generated using traffic generator as below
DMAC = ff.ff.ff.ff.ff.ff
SMAC = 00.00.04.00.08.00
SIP = 0.0.0.0
DIP = 11.95.232.123 (VIP)
When IXIA  sends ACD packets to the actual SVI IP, the switch responds with a GARP as seen below - 
Nexus Switch A# ethanalyzer local interface  inband display-filter "arp" limit-captured-frames 0
Capturing on inband
2018-10-18 07:56:09.422340 Xerox_00:08:00 -> Broadcast    ARP 60 Who has 11.95.232.121?  Tell 0.0.0.0
2018-10-18 07:56:09.424806 Cisco_a6:cb:c1 -> Broadcast    ARP 60 Gratuitous ARP for 11.95.232.121 (Request)
2018-10-18 07:56:09.432365 Xerox_00:08:00 -> Broadcast    ARP 60 Who has 11.95.232.121?  Tell 0.0.0.0
2018-10-18 07:56:09.434743 Cisco_a6:cb:c1 -> Broadcast    ARP 60 Gratuitous ARP for 11.95.232.121 (Request)
But when the same packet is sent with the GLBP VIP, we do not see any response from the switch. The capture on the CPU of the switch seen below -
Nexus Switch A# ethanalyzer local interface  inband display-filter "arp" limit-captured-frames 0
Capturing on inband
2018-10-18 07:56:58.429581 Xerox_00:08:00 -> Broadcast    ARP 60 Who has 11.95.232.123?  Tell 0.0.0.0
2018-10-18 07:56:58.439582 Xerox_00:08:00 -> Broadcast    ARP 60 Who has 11.95.232.123?  Tell 0.0.0.0
Note - ELAM capture (not included here) on Nexus shows source index as ingress ethernet interface which is the interface through which packet entered the switch. However, destination index points to drop index.
Similar tests performed on other FHRP protocols like HSRP and VRRP show that the switch responds to ACD packet sent with VIP IP address.

Conclusion
With GLBP configured, both switches hold the control of the VIP. Due to this GARP is not sent as it would generate duplicate arp in the logs.
