Volunteers supporting those in need, remotely
“When the pandemic started, our volunteer pool dropped in half. A lot of folks said, 'we will help out if there's a possibility for you to go remote.' We are able to integrate Webex Meetings, Webex Calling, Webex Messaging. It gives our volunteers the feeling of being together in the call room.”
