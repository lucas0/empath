    Product overview
As the world adapts to newer ways of operation, we see tremendous growth in internet usage driven by an increasing rate of digitization along with a rush to adopt a cloud-first approach. Meeting up with this demand would require significant investment from organizations. A robust and scalable solution offering best-in-class capabilities at a lower operating cost is what they need in order to expand their infrastructure and establish intelligent connections.
The Cisco® Network Convergence System 57C3 Series Routers (hereinafter referred to as the NCS 57C3) are designed for cost-effective delivery of next-generation networking services. These are high-capacity and low-power-consuming devices available in a 3-rack-unit compact form factor. The chassis along with the Modular Port Adapters (MPAs) provide options of using different types of interfaces ranging from 1GE to 400GE along with industry-leading MACSec encryption and Class C Timing support. These devices also provide Control Plane redundancy, thereby enabling high availability and reliability.
The Cisco NCS 57C3 Series Routers are well equipped for a range of applications such as Carrier Ethernet Aggregation, Subscriber Services, Business Ethernet, Mobile Edge, Campus, Peering and Core roles. Powered by the industry-leading Cisco IOS® XR Software, the NCS 57C3 supports a rich and comprehensive set of features like QoS, IP/MPLS, Segment Routing, SRv6, and Ethernet VPN (EVPN).
