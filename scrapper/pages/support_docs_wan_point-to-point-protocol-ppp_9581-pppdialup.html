Introduction
This document illustrates a Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) dialin configuration using external modems.
Prerequisites
Requirements
You need to configure a username and password for each user that you want to be able to dial in to because this configuration does not have a Terminal Access Controller Access Controller System (TACACS+) or Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) server. All IP addresses are handed to the client from a pool.
For this configuration, you need the following:
The usernames and passwords you want clients to use (even if you are going to add TACACS+ or RADIUS later, add a few names to the router to test the lines).
The IP addressing scheme for creating the pool and for static routing.
Components Used
The information in this document is based on the software and hardware versions below.
A Cisco 2511 in a lab environment with cleared configurations.
Cisco IOSÂ® version 12.2(10b) on the router.
Four numbers of external asynchronous modems.
The information presented in this document was created from devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If you work in a live network, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command before you use it.
Related Products
You can also use this configuration with these hardware and software versions:
Routers with asynchronous interfaces and serial interfaces capable of configuring async interfaces.
WIC-2A/S, 8 or 16 asynchronous port serial interfaces can be used.
Conventions
For more information on document conventions, refer to the Cisco Technical Tips Conventions.
Configure
In this section, you are presented with the information to configure the features described in this document.
Note: To find additional information on the commands used in this document, use the Command Lookup Tool (registered customers only) .
Network Diagram
This document uses the network setup shown in this diagram.
Configurations
This document uses the configurations shown below.
This configuration was tested using Cisco IOS Software Release 12.2(10b) on a 2511 series router. The same configuration concepts would apply to a similar router topology or other Cisco IOS releases starting from 11.0(3) or later .

For remote users who wants to connect to their central office at random intervals for shorter duration time, this type of dial-up connections gives a cheaper solution. In the above configuration a user dials up from his desktop over a modem and establishes a PPP connectivity to the central office through a PSTN network.
To implement this configuration, you have to configure the following:
Async interface.
Async lines.
Pool of ip addresses in global configuration mode.
Modem parameters - modemcap entry and Modem-Router Connection Guide.
Dial-up networking has to be configured in a host.

On a Windows 2000 Server Host
Setup the dial-up connection in the Windows 2000 host. Configure the username, password and phone number and dial the connection.
After the dial-up connection is established, an IP address is allocated from the dialup pool configured in the router. We can verify that by issuing the command ipconfig in the host. It is displayed as a PPP adapter in the host.

To verify the connection establishment from the Windows 2000 server host to the Cisco 2511 router, you can ping from the host to the router ethernet port and verify the connection establishment. Here, 192.168.39.1 is the ethernet port IP address of the router.

Troubleshooting Commands
Certain show commands are supported by the Output Interpreter Tool (registered customers only) , which allows you to view an analysis of show command output.
Note: Before issuing debug commands, please see Important Information on Debug Commands.
debug ppp negotiation - To see if a client is passing PPP negotiation. This is when you check for address negotiation.
debug ppp authentication - To see if a client is passing authentication.
debug ppp error - To display protocol errors and error statistics associated with PPP connection negotiation and operation.
debug modem - To see if the router is receiving the right signals from the modem.
show line [# tty line] - To look for the modem hardware state.
The following outputs were obtained from the Cisco 2511 router. They show the Windows 2000 server dialing to PSTN link of the Cisco 2511 and establishing a PPP connection.
