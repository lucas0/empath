Dynamic Policy and Subscriber Management
With Cisco Policy Suite for BNG, network operators can dynamically manage residential and business broadband subscriptions. You can directly monetize your networks by mapping specific features to specific revenue streams. Cisco Policy Suite makes it easier to deploy network- and application-centered policy technology to support wholesale and retail business models.
Features and Capabilities
Cisco Policy Suite for BNG, the Broadband Network Gateway, offers industry-leading performance, high availability, and disaster recovery and can be used in all types of broadband deployments. It simplifies network architecture by using a single subscriber repository that draws from older data sources without conversion or revision.
The solution provides real-time management of subscriber sessions, applications, and network resources based on service-provider-configured business rules and subscriber data management. The virtualized platform can dynamically scale your policy solution to adapt to real-world needs, helping to reduce capital expenditures (CapEx) and operating expenses (OpEx). With a Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) model, Cisco Policy Suite instances can be deployed much more quickly, with far fewer changes, than is possible with traditional policy hardware architectures.
Service providers can:
Reduce the time to create new services and applications
Boost revenue by rapidly rolling out new applications
Maintain network integrity by dynamically managing broadband performance
Reduce and defer infrastructure costs
Optimizing service revenues from residential and enterprise markets
Cisco Policy Suite also helps service providers streamline network policy control by combining multiple services, such as Internet, email, triple play (voice, video, and data services), and security. You can easily integrate a range of advanced broadband, value-added, and third-party services.
In addition, broadband providers can avoid the need for custom code when rolling out tiered and personalized service packages, by using premade templates and customized portals.
