This document provides information about Cisco Crosswork Network Controller 4.1.x, including product overview, solution components, new features and functionality, compatibility information, and known issues and limitations.
Overview
Cisco Crosswork Network Controller empowers customers to simplify and automate intent-based network service provisioning, monitoring and optimization in a multi-vendor network environment with a common GUI and API.
The solution combines intent-based network automation to deliver critical capabilities for service orchestration and fulfilment, network optimization, service path computation, device deployment and management, and anomaly detection and automatic remediation. Using telemetry gathering and automated responses, Cisco Crosswork Network Controller delivers network optimization capabilities that would be nearly impossible to replicate even with a highly skilled and dedicated staff operating the network.
The fully integrated solution combines core capabilities from multiple innovative, industry-leading products including Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (NSO), Cisco Segment Routing Path Computation Element (SR-PCE), Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway, and Cisco Crosswork's infrastructure and suite of applications. Its unified user interface allows real-time visualization of the network topology and services, as well as service and transport provisioning, via a single pane of glass.
Primary Use Cases:
Orchestrated service provisioning: Provisioning of L2VPN and L3VPN services with underlay transport policies in order to define, meet, and maintain SLAs, using the UI or APIs.
Real-time network and bandwidth optimization:Intent-based closed-loop automation, congestion mitigation and dynamic bandwidth management based on Segment Routing and RSVP-TE. Optimization of bandwidth resource utilization by setting utilization thresholds on links and calculating tactical alternate paths when thresholds are exceeded. Real-time telemetry is used to detect changes in network traffic and then changes in the network are automatically implemented to deliver on the operator's intent.
Local Congestion Management: Local, interface-level congestion mitigation recommendations for rerouting traffic around the congested interface using tactical TE policies.
Visualization of network and service topology and inventory: Visibility into device and service inventory and visualization of devices, links, and transport/VPN services and their status on logical or geographical maps.
Performance-based closed-loop automation:Automated discovery and remediation of problems in the network by allowing Key Performance Indicator (KPI) customization and monitoring and triggering of pre-defined remediation tasks when a KPI threshold is breached. Cisco Crosswork Health Insights and Change Automation (optional add-ons) must be installed for this use case.
Planning, scheduling, and automating network maintenance tasks: Scheduling an appropriate maintenance window for a maintenance task after evaluating the potential impact of the down-time on the network (using WAE Design). Automating the execution of maintenance tasks (such as throughput checks, software upgrades, SMU installs) using playbooks. Cisco Crosswork Health Insights and Change Automation (optional add-ons) must be installed for this use case.
Secure zero-touch onboarding and provisioning of devices: Automatic onboarding of new IOS-XR devices and provisioning of Day0 configuration, resulting in faster deployment of new hardware at a lower operating cost. Cisco Crosswork Zero Touch Provisioning (optional add-on) must be installed for this use case.
Visualization of native SR paths: Visualizing the native path using the traceroute SR-MPLS multipath command to get the actual paths between the source and the destination can be achieved using Path Query. With Cisco Crosswork Network Controller, a traceroute command runs on the source device for the destination TE-Router ID and assists in retrieving the paths.
Discovery, Analysis, and Visualization of Multicast Trees using Tree-SID in Segment Routed Networks: Visualizing pre-provisioned Segment Routing Path Computation Elements (SR-PCE) created Multicast Trees using TREE-SID within your network is critical for video broadcasting and streaming service providers who must use multicast protocols to replicate traffic and send it to different points in the network. With Cisco Crosswork Network Controller, users can visualize pre-provisioned Tree Segment Identifier (Tree-SID) SR paths easily and quickly.

What's New?
Service Health Service Health monitoring is available for both Basic Monitoring and Advanced Monitoring. With Basic Monitoring, there are fewer resources consumed, but more services (up to 50,000) can be monitored in less detail . With Advanced Monitoring, more resources are consumed, but fewer services (up to 2,000) can be monitored (but in greater detail). In total, Basic + Advanced Monitoring provides up to 52,000 services that can be monitored. For more information on Service Health, see Cisco Service Health in the Solution Components and Integrated Architecture section. Other new features and functionality:
External Storage supported, in conjunction with Internal Storage, for expanded historical Service Health monitoring data capacity.
The Service Health Collection Jobs administrative option provides the capability to view Parameterized Jobs (template-based collection jobs) that supports a greater number of jobs, adding the ability to view CLI collection jobs. This is useful when troubleshooting collection job issues by examining details of individual devices using Parameterized Jobs. Devices are identified by their Context ID (protocol) so to determine if they are GMNI, SNMP, or CLI-based jobs.
Brownfield Service Visualization API Extension
Brownfield support services API extension allows operators to create visualizations for services they have provisioned in the network that CW cannot already visualize. Details about the API including samples can be found on Cisco Devnet.
Cisco Customer Experience (CX) provides a new service offer to assist customers get started creating their own service visualizations. For more details, contact your CX representative.
Flexible Algorithm Visualization
Crosswork Network Controller now supports use of Segment Routing Flexible Algorithm (Flex-Algo) to view up to two Flexible Algorithm IDs in your network enabled in the Traffic Engineering topology view.
SRv6
Crosswork Network Controller now supports L2VPN services over SRv6 (L2VPN EVPN VPWS and VPLS)..
Multipoint VPLS using EVPN
Cisco Crosswork Network Controller now extends L2VPN EVPN VPWS support with the addition of L2VPN EVPN VPLS and the following service topologies: ELAN, ETREE, and Custom.
ELAN any-to-any: Full mesh topology where all sites communicate with one another. The same route targets (RTs) are assigned across all nodes.
ETREE hub-spoke: RTs are assigned in a manner which spokes are able to communicate with the hub, but not with each other. A spoke is defined if node-role is defined for a given site.
Custom: User will manually define RT values for each site.
Tree-SID Visualization
Cisco Crosswork Network Controller lets you visualize the Tree-SID policies implemented in your network that uses the Segment Routing Path Computation Element (SR-PCE) using path computation element protocol (PCEP). You can view the details of the Tree-SID root, transit and leaf nodes, bud nodes. You can easily confirm that Tree-SID is implemented correctly in your network.
Note 
Tree-SID paths for Bud nodes are not displayed on the topology-map UI and the policy details section.
Tree-SID policies are not deleted from the UI when PCE is down.
EMS Services Support
To enable service-driven workflow for packet networks, Element Management System (EMS) services are bundled with the Crosswork Network Controller Advantage pack. The EMS functions include inventory, fault, and Software Image Management (SWIM).
Inventory service integrates deep inventory collection with Cisco Crosswork’s Device Lifecycle Management (DLM). It enriches the existing device onboarding workflow to gather more insights about the device. Built-in device packages enable deep inventory collection when the user manually attaches a device to the Crosswork Data Gateway. The collection is persisted in the database and monitored using the Inventory APIs.
Fault service is associated with alarm management. It provides API support for subscription, request, retrieval, and auto-clearing of alarms for Topology Visualization services. Monitored using the Fault APIs, the fault service improves the existing topology views by showing the alarm status for devices and links.
SWIM is integrated with Crosswork Change Automation and managed with SWIM APIs. It allows operators to view, import, and delete software images, as well as push software images to the devices in the network. SWIM improves compliance and accelerates upgrades.

Important Notes
Take into consideration the following important information before starting to use Cisco Crosswork Network Controller 4.1.x:
Cisco Crosswork Change Automation 4.4 & Cisco Crosswork Health Insights 4.4:
Cisco Crosswork Change Automation 4.4 and Cisco Crosswork Health Insights 4.4 are available as an add-on license in the purchase of Cisco Crosswork Network Controller 4.1.x.
Obtaining Cisco Geomaps for topology map renditions:
Cisco Crosswork Network Controller allows users to obtain downloadable geographical maps (geomaps) based on their specific topology mapping needs. If your environment allows contact with the map provider website we specify in Crosswork, you do not need to download the map files. If your environment does not allow outside access, you will need to download the map files for the areas where your network requires coverage.
VPN Service Provisioning:
The Cisco NSO sample function packs are provided as a starting point for VPN service and RSVP-TE provisioning functionality in Cisco Crosswork Network Controller. While the samples can be used “as is” in some limited network configurations, they are intended to demonstrate the extensible design of Cisco Crosswork Network Controller. Answers to common questions can be found here and Cisco Customer Experience representatives can provide answers to general questions about the samples. Support for customization of the samples for your specific use cases can be arranged through your Cisco account team.

Note
For licensing and ordering information, work with your Cisco Partner or Cisco Sales representative to review the options described in the Cisco Crosswork Network Controller Ordering Guide.
Known Issues and Limitations
The table below shows known issues and limitations that should be taken into account before starting to work with Cisco Crosswork Network Controller 4.1.x.
Table 6. Known Issues and Limitations
Issue/Limitation
Context within Cisco Crosswork Network Controller
If you shut down an SR Policy (L2VPN EVPN SR-TE service with fallback enable with Y1731 configured) at one endpoint, it results in packet loss and the Y1731 peer MEP check fails with symptoms flapping between up and peer-mep-failed and cross-check-missing in the device.
SR Policy
If service monitoring fails due to transient errors, such as HPM “nats time out”, stop and then restart service monitoring.
Service Health
Only enable one discovery protocol (CDP or LLDP) on an ethernet link when enabling protocols in the Layer 2 (L2) discovery settings. If you enable both CDP and LLDP on the same ethernet link and enable both protocols in the L2 discovery settings, it will result in duplicate links in the UI.
Layer 2 Discovery
After monitoring fails in one of the worker nodes in a cluster, stopping and restarting the monitoring again does not resolve the issue and the service remains in error state while Assurance Graph remains unavailable. After the node is recovered and is again up (with all CAPPs and pods in a healthy state), the service remains in error state.
Service Health
NSO service pack implementation should support proper handling of zombies and ensure that the delete service-state-change notifications be sent when a zombies for the service are removed for a proper integration with Cisco Crosswork Network Controller UI. Without this support, deleting or redeploy of a service from Cisco Crosswork Network Controller UI may not work as expected.
NSO service pack implementation
Service Health’s corresponding VPN remains in a healthy state (it does not fail or move to a degraded state) after the user powers off Cisco Data Gateway (CDG) and the collection jobs become degraded as expected. In this scenario, a user onboards devices attached to a CDG with no spare on the pool. An L3VPN service is created and is enabled to monitor with Advanced/gold profile. Once the Service Health service shows a healthy state, CDG is powered off and collection jobs become degraded. Because Service Health is live monitoring, the user would expect the corresponding VPNs to also become degraded or fail and not remain in a healthy state.
Service Health
L2VPN cannot support the use of the SRv6TE or SRv6TE ODN (via route policy). Route Policy
Explicit path is not supported for SRv6 policy. However, when provisioning an SRv6 policy, if the candidate path is configured prior to enabling SRv6, the Explicit Path option is visible and can be committed with no warning and the explicit path config is ignored when SRv6 policy is pushed to the devices. If SRv6 is enabled first, before configuring the path, the Explicit Path option is not visible due to no SRv6 explicit path support.
Provisioning an SRv6 policy and configuring the Path
Custom templates cannot be created using the GUI, nor can their contents be visualized in the GUI. Custom templates created offline can be applied to service models via GUI and API. However, topology map overlays and service configuration views will not display custom template configuration.
Provisioning GUI
Services can be provisioned to devices when devices are not mapped to Cisco Crosswork Network Controller or are operationally down, provided they are reachable and in sync with NSO.
