  Internationalization and Localization
Caution: A Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director system that is using language support from Release 4.1, will lose that support when first upgraded to Release 5.0, until language packs for the new release are available and installed.
Internationalization (i18n)
Internationalization (known as i18n) support refers to the software infrastructure that is designed to accommodate multiple language translations (localization) without requiring additional engineering changes to that software.
The Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director Release 5.0 software supports i18n for the following general areas of the solution:
■Control Panel
■Dynamic Menu Board application
■Management Dashboard
■IP Phone user interface
■Software Manager
■TV user interface
Localization (L10n)
Localization (known as L10n) refers to the implementation of the specific regional language translation support within a software interface that has been designed for i18n. English is the default language.
Note: Certain locales are not supported, such as right-to-left languages.
Language Packs for Localization
Note: Language packs are release-specific. They are not available with the initial release of Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director Release 5.0. You can install available language packs for Release 5.0, after you have installed or upgraded to Release 5.0, and when the 5.0 version of the language pack for the desired language is available.
Caution: A Cisco StadiumVision Director system that is using language support from Release 4.1 will lose that support when first upgraded to Release 5.0, until language packs for Release 5.0 are available and installed.
Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director Release 5.0 provides the flexibility to upload and install only the specific language(s) that you want to support through the independent installation of Language Packs.

New and Changed Information in Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director Release 5.0
This section describes new features, enhancements and changes in support or behavior in Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director Release 5.0. It includes the following sections:
■Automatic Proof of Play Export
■Media Player Enhancements and Information
■User Control API Enhancement
Automatic Proof of Play Export
WHAT IS IT
A Proof of Play (PoP) enhancement that automatically exports the Summary and Detailed PoP data (in CSV format) to a designated server using Secure FTP (SFTP) or Secure HTTP (HTTPS)—if you have enabled PoP for a script. You can verify the status of the export function under the new “Transmitted” column on the Control Panel Proof of Play screen. A green icon means the data has been transmitted; red means it failed.
Note: When automatic PoP export is enabled, the standard PoP reporting features remain available in Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director Release 5.0.
WHY USE IT
When you want to use another tool or application to consume the PoP CSV data from Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director.
WHERE TO CONFIGURE IT
Automatic PoP Export is disabled by default. You must enable the feature globally and configure the corresponding common and protocol-specific properties. PoP must also be enabled for a script for the automatic export to occur.
Figure 1 Proof of Play Common Settings to Enable Automatic Export of PoP Data
    ■After you configure the File Transfer Protocol, you also must configure the corresponding properties for the HTTPS Settings or SFTP Settings from the Pofp Export Settings menu.
FOR MORE INFORMATION
See How to Configure Automatic Proof of Play Export
  Media Player Enhancements and Information
The following media player enhancements are introduced in Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director Release 5.0:
■Multicast Video Scaling for SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Players
■Multicast Video Tune-In Timeout Default Value Change
■Portrait Mode Content Renditions for SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Players
■TV Control Using HDMI CEC for SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Players
■WiFi Network Connectivity on the SV-4K
Multicast Video Scaling for SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Players
Note: Multicast video scaling is supported on the SV-4K and DMP-2K only.
WHAT IS IT
Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director Release 5.0 introduces support for scaling a multicast video region across a video wall display for both portrait and landscape orientation.
Scaling refers to support of two things:
1. Stretching of the content.
2. Showing only a portion of the content per display in a multi-screen video wall.
WHY USE IT
Multicast video scaling is intended for use in video walls.
Multicast Video Tune-In Timeout Default Value Change
Note: Configuration of Multicast Video Tune-In Timeout is supported on the SV-4K and DMP-2K only.
WHAT IS IT
A change to the Video tune-in timeout default value from 500 ms to 10000 ms (10 seconds) for SV-4K and DMP-2K media players. The default change is made in new Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director Release 5.0 installations only. The value is used for receiving multicast video information on the network and for DCM failure detection.
WHY USE IT
Certain venues might encounter network conditions requiring tuning of this multicast video operation.
WHERE TO CONFIGURE IT
Go to: Management Dashboard > Dynamic Signage Director Configuration > System Configuration > Global DMP Settings > SV-DMP Common Settings.
Note: After you change and refresh the property value, you must reboot the DMP(s).
  Portrait Mode Content Renditions for SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Players
WHAT IS IT
Portrait mode is a new rendering mode for TV displays controlled by SV-4K or DMP-2K media players. It allows the DMPs to automatically rotate content for proper orientation on vertically-positioned displays.
Note: Scaling of content across multiple display screens in portrait mode is only supported for multicast streaming video. See Multicast Video Scaling for SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Players.
Scaling refers to support of two things:
1. Stretching of the content.
2. Showing only a portion of the content per display in a multi-screen video wall.
WHY USE IT
Use portrait mode for vertical TV displays to auto-rotate content that would otherwise be improperly cut off and displayed sideways with the default landscape orientation.
WHERE TO CONFIGURE IT
Go to Control Panel > Setup > Devices > Display Specifications and select or add your display. In the Display Parameters panel, add the “dmp.portrait” command and set it to “true.” Be sure to reboot the DMP.
  Note: The sv4k.videoMode display parameter is unrelated and is not a required or expected configuration for use of portrait mode content renditions. In addition, only certain values are supported for sv4k.videoMode, and they should not be changed to any other values (See Cisco Vision Deployment Guide: SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Players). However, your content should be designed for 1920 pixels high and 1080 pixels wide. The default template canvas will still show horizontal orientation when you are using portrait mode, but you can add regions that extend beyond the canvas.
TV Control Using HDMI CEC for SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Players
Note: HDMI CEC control is supported on the SV-4K and DMP-2K only.
WHAT IS IT
New Display Specifications configuration that allows you to control the following three TV functions through HDMI Consumer Electronics Control (CEC):
■Power On
■Standby (Power Off)
■Power Status
When HDMI CEC TV control is enabled, HDMI CEC is used instead of RS-232 for TV control functions. To control TVs, you can run the TV On and TV Off from the DMP and TV Controls > TV Commands menu in the Management Dashboard.
Note: Not all TVs support the standard HDMI CEC commands. It is important that you test the TV models that you plan to install for support of HDMI CEC, and be sure to turn HDMI-CEC on. TV manufacturers refer to CEC by different trade names. (For example: Anynet+ [Samsung], BRAVIA Link [Sony], EasyLink [Phillips], and SimpLink [LG]).
For information about TVs tested successfully for power on, power query, and power status commands, see TV Qualification for HDMI CEC Control of TV Power On/Off.
WHY USE IT
When your TV model does not support RS-232 connectivity for TV control, or you prefer to use HDMI/CEC.
WHERE TO CONFIGURE IT
A new display specification called HDMI/CEC Standard is introduced with the HDMI CEC-related display parameters already configured.
  You can apply the new HDMI/CEC Standard display specification for new TVs, or you can modify an existing display specification to add the display parameters commands. The following commands are used with HDMI/CEC TV control:
■ dmp.powerQueryByCEC —(New in Release 5.0) Enables powerQuery to get TV Power status using HDMI/CEC instead of RS-232.
Note: This command is not supported by all TV models, so it is separately configurable.
■ dmp.TVControlbyCEC —(New in Release 5.0) Enables TV control using HDMI/CEC instead of RS-232.
■ dmp.monitorAPIDelay —Frequency of power query command sent by Dynamic Signage Director over HDMI CEC to the TV. The default is 120000 ms (2 minutes). This command is also supported when using TV control with RS-232.
■ dmp.monitorPower —Enables Dynamic Signage Director to run a power query to the TV using the Get Status command from the Management Dashboard. This command is also supported when using TV control with RS-232.
Note: You can run the Get Status command from the Management Dashboard to get the latest TV health status known to the DMP. This information can be up to two minutes old, or a few seconds depending on when the power query last ran. If the “dmp.monitorPower” parameter is set to false then you will not get the correct TV health status.
WiFi Network Connectivity on the SV-4K
WHAT IS IT
Support for wireless network connectivity to the SV-4K over an 802.11a, 802.11b, or 802.11n wireless network in the Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director venue.
Note: The wireless network must support multicast traffic for communication over the Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director network. However, multicast video is not supported due to bandwidth limitations over a wireless network.
The wireless network SSID and passphrase is configured globally for all SV-4Ks in the system. The SV-4K firmware automatically tries to connect with WEP (if the passphrase is of a suitable length), WPA1 or WPA2.
WHY USE IT
When you need to deploy SV-4Ks in areas where there is no existing Ethernet cabling, where it is difficult to run cabling, or simply as an alternative to Ethernet network connectivity. 
Note: For initial deployment of an SV-4K with WiFi connectivity, you will need both a PoE+ network connection in addition to connection of the SV-4K using the DMP power supply adapter. After the DMP is deployed for WiFi, a PoE+ connection is no longer needed for the DMP. In fact, the DMP will not route packets over the WiFi connection while the Ethernet port is connected and operational.
WHERE TO CONFIGURE IT
Configuration of SV-4Ks to support wireless network connectivity requires:
■Setting up the WiFi access point and configuring it to receive multicast messages.
■Specifying global SV-4K settings in the Management Dashboard to specify the SSID and passphrase for the wireless network.
■Initially registering the SV-4K with Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director using standard SV-4K auto-provisioning over a wired Ethernet connection using PoE+.
■Enabling the SV-4K for WiFi connectivity (on a per-DMP basis) in one of the following ways:
–Control Panel device settings
–Bulk Administration Tool (BAT)

System Enhancements
The following system enhancements are introduced in Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director Release 5.0:
■Improved Handling of Duplicate DMP IP Addresses
■TUI Enhancement: Disk Speed Test
■Venue Administrator RBAC Enhancement
■Video Upload Support for Files Up to 4 GB in Size
Improved Handling of Duplicate DMP IP Addresses
Infinite DHCP leases continue to be recommended for DMP IP address assignments in Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director. However, in the case of certain network conditions such as a temporary network problem causing segmentation of clients, or restart of a redundant stateless DHCP server, duplicate IP addresses on your DMPs can occur.
Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director Release 5.0 introduces the following behaviors to improve handling of DMPs attempting to register with the same IP address:
■If more than one DMP registers with the same IP address, then the most recent DMP to register is assigned the address. All other DMPs attempting to register with that IP address are set to 0.0.0.0.
■An alert is raised to prevent duplication of an IP address when a new DMP is created through the Management Dashboard or during upload of device data using the Bulk Administration Tool (BAT). However, no alerts occur when IP address reassignments to 0.0.0.0 are made during auto registration.
Note: If a static IP address needs to be reassigned to another DMP, and that address is already in the system database, then that IP address must be removed from the current DMP first.
TUI Enhancement: Disk Speed Test
WHAT IS IT
A new option called “Disk Speed Test” in the TUI Troubleshooting/Disk Monitoring menu that reports amount of time and rate for a data copy of 1 GB.
WHY USE IT
The information from this troubleshooting test might be requested by Technical Support to get more information about disk performance in a virtual environment.
WHERE TO CONFIGURE IT
Log in to the TUI as installer. Go to: Main Menu > Troubleshooting > Disk Monitoring > Disk Speed Test (Figure 3).
Figure 3 Disk Speed Test TUI Option
  Venue Administrator RBAC Enhancement
Note: New Management Dashboard and CCM functionality is added for the Venue Administrator in Release 5.0.0-526 (SP2).
WHAT IS IT

Beginning in Release 5.0.0-526 (SP2), Venue Administrators can run the Reboot Device command from CCM to restart DMPs.
Venue Administrators can only edit the Display Specifications panel.
Support users can set up TV control PINs and channel guides for suites.
Venue Administrators can delete content associated (tagged) to the venues for which that venue admin is authorized. External content, channels, and Dynamic Menu Board (DMB) content items are global to all venues. Therefore, these global content items also can be deleted by the venue admin.
Venue Administrators and Venue Operators have script control only, and only for venues authorized by the Administrator for that user.
Help Desk users can view and monitor information on the Management Dashboard with read-only access. They also can run Get Status, Ping, Display IP, and Ping Test commands for DMPs in the Management Dashboard.
Support users can run Get Status, Ping, Display IP, Ping Test, TV On/Off, Set Display Input, Set Display Banner, Set Closed Captions, Set Video Channel, Cabling Test using TDR, and Show TDR Test Results commands.
Venue Administrators can view and monitor information on the Management Dashboard with read-only access to the venues for which permissions are granted. They also can run Get Status, Ping, Display IP, and Ping Test commands in the Management Dashboard for the DMPs in the venues at which that Venue Administrator is authorized. Beginning in Release 5.0.0-526 (SP2), Venue Administrators can run all DMP and TV commands.
Venue Operators can view and monitor information on the Management Dashboard with read-only access to the venues for which permissions are granted. They also can run Get Status, Ping, Display IP, and Query Syslog commands in the Management Dashboard for the DMPs in the venues at which that Venue Operator is authorized.
The SSC portal cannot be accessed directly from the Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director main menu or Control Panel. Access to the user-specific portal is opened only by logging into Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director as an SSC user.
  WHY USE IT
Assign the Venue Administrator user role when you want to provide additional visibility and support capabilities beyond that of a Venue Operator on a venue-specific basis. The Venue Administrator has additional read-only access to areas of the UI, in addition to being able to set up Display Specifications.
WHERE TO CONFIGURE IT
Note: Only the Administrator can define a Venue Administrator role.
    1
Go to: Control Panel > Setup > Users and create user with Venue Administrator role.
2
Go to: Control Panel > Setup > Venues and associate venues to the new Venue Administrator user.
FOR MORE INFORMATION
See “Associating Venues with Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director Objects” in the Cisco Vision Administration Guide: Dynamic Signage Director.
Video Upload Support for Files Up to 4 GB in Size
WHAT IS IT
A configurable Registry key in the Management Dashboard that allows an administrator to set the maximum allowable video file size for upload by your Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director system. The default value is 4 GB (the maximum). Users will be notified if the file exceeds the maximum size at the time of file upload.
Note: Although now you can upload video files up to 4 GB in size to the Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director content library, the Cisco DMP 4310G does not support files larger than 2 GB (which is the maximum file upload size in prior releases).
WHY USE IT
To set a maximum file size from 1-4 GB for videos uploaded and stored in the system, possibly to conserve storage.
WHERE TO CONFIGURE IT
Note: The value must be an integer (in GB units). For example, you can specify a value of “1” but not “1.5.”
  User Control API Enhancement

Important Migration and Upgrade Notes
In this document, the following terminology is used to qualify changes to your Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director hardware and software environment:
■Migration—Moving an existing Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director platform to a new hardware platform in a virtual environment.
■Upgrade — Changing your software version to a newer release on your existing platform.
Caution: For any release 4.1 systems or releases prior to 5.0 SP2, imported logos as channel icons are not backed up (the channel icons will disappear during the upgrade procedure of backing up the primary and restoring to secondary if the icons are not already on the secondary server). A maintenance patch (SV-DIRECTOR-HOTFIX-CSCvd35309) is needed on both the primary and secondary servers before you run any backup and restore operations as part of an upgrade from any 4.1 release, or to Release 5.0 SP2. Otherwise, you will need to re-import the logos after upgrading to Release 5.0 SP2.
This section includes the following topics:
■Migration Restrictions
■Upgrade Paths
■Installation and Upgrade Files
■Upgrade Process
Migration Restrictions
Migration means moving an existing Cisco StadiumVision Director platform to a new hardware platform in a virtual environment. Brand new installations of Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director on new platforms in a virtual environment are not considered a migration and are supported.
Caution: Migration to a virtual environment on your existing Platform 2 or Platform 3 servers is not supported. For information about migrating from your Platform server to a virtual server environment, see the “Migrating From Platform 2 Servers to a Virtual Environment” module in the Cisco StadiumVision Director Software Installation and Upgrade Guide, Release 4.1 .

This section includes the following topics:
■Deployment Guidelines for the SV-4K Media Player
■Deployment Guidelines for the DMP-2K Media Player
■Firmware Configuration for the SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Player
■Firmware Download for the SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Player
Deployment Guidelines for the SV-4K Media Player
Before you deploy the SV-4K media player, consider the following guidelines:
■The SV-4K media player has different requirements than the Cisco DMP 4310G, including, but not limited to support of PoE+ for 30W of port power on the Cisco Connected Stadium switch. Be sure that your switch can meet these and the other requirements for deployment of the SV-4K.
■Before you configure the SV-4K for WiFi network connectivity, you must first provision the SV-4K according to the normal auto-registration process to download the required firmware and WiFi credentials over a hard-wired connection.
Caution: If you are upgrading from Release 5.0.0-235 to Release 5.0.0-320, and you have already installed an SV-4K with WiFi enablement, then you must re-provision that SV-4K again over a hard-wired connection so that the WiFi configuration persists. After an upgrade to Release 5.0.0-320, the WiFi configuration for the DMP is preserved.
For more information, see:
■ Cisco Vision Deployment Guide: SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Players
■ How to Deploy WiFi Network Connectivity on the SV-4K
■ Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Solution Network Requirements (available to qualified Cisco Vision partners)
Deployment Guidelines for the DMP-2K Media Player
Before you deploy the DMP-2K media player, consider the following guidelines:
■The DMP-2K has the same requirement as the SV-4K for PoE+ for 30W of port power on the Cisco Connected Stadium switch. Be sure that your switch can meet these and the other requirements for deployment of the device.
Caution: For initial deployment of a new DMP-2K, be sure that:
– No other accessories are attached to the DMP-2K.
– You are using a standard category Category 5e or 6 cable up to 100 m in length.
■Be sure to configure your DHCP server with the corresponding Option 43 and Option 60 strings for the DMP-2K. Use “Cisco DMP-2K” for the Option 60 Vendor Class Identifier string for new DMPs shipped from the factory.
Firmware Configuration for the SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Player

Contact your Cisco Systems representative for the “How to Download SV-4K Firmware” document, available to qualified Cisco Vision partners.
Limitations and Restrictions
When using Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director Release 5.0, be aware of the following limitations and restrictions:
Caution: Proof of play raw data repository in /var/sv/pofp/raw directory is not part of the backup process. In normal operation, a completed script with a green dot already has a copy of the raw data and is part of the backup data. No further action is needed aside from generating the PoP report. For completed scripts that do not have a green dot, it is very important to investigate or call for support within 60 days of the event, after which time the PoP messages in the raw directory will be deleted.
■If you have previously accessed a different Cisco StadiumVision Director version on your computer, sometimes unexpected behavior or warnings arise, or you might access an older version of the interface. In this case, and especially after an upgrade, you must clear your browser cache.
■The first release of Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director Release 5.0 implements the infrastructure only to support i18n and L10n to support the independent installation of other language packs with Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director Release 5.0 as they become available. Language support for Release 5.0 is introduced in Release 5.0.0-421. See the “Language Packs for Localization” section on page 20.
■Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director does not support internationalization for back-end messaging.
■Non-English characters are not supported as a Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director login credential.
■Multi-user support in Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director is limited to script editing only. No other Control Panel functions for templates, zones, groups, and playlists support a multi-user environment, and these areas can be deleted by other users. However, users are notified about potential impact due to currently locked scripts and are prompted for confirmation of deletion and given an option to use instant messaging to coordinate with the script owner.
■No more than 10 user sessions can be supported at any one time in the Management Dashboard and Control Panel areas. The system does not prevent more than 10 sessions to be opened, so you need to be careful that you do not exceed this limit.
■No more than 50 staging threads can be processing in Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director at any one time. The default maximum is 10. The maximum is configured using the “stagingThreadNum” registry found under the Tools > Advanced > Registry section of the Management Dashboard.
Note: If auto-registration is enabled and a new DMP is detected, then Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director initiates staging and always uses 50 as the maximum value. In this case, the stagingThreadNum registry setting is ignored and remains unchanged.

Media Player Maintenance Recommendations
To avoid unexpected behavior and maintain normal operation of your devices, it is highly recommended that you perform a soft reboot of all of the media players in your system:
■Cisco DMP 4310G—Weekly.
■SV-4K—Weekly.
■DMP-2K—Weekly.
You can reboot DMPs manually or configure a periodic task to run automatically. Remember that the automatic scheduled task applies globally to all media players in the system.
Note: Before you perform a reboot, be sure that there are not any active scripts running.
For more information see the “ How to Configure the Reboot DMP System Task From the Management Dashboard ” Task Note.
System Utilization Values
Measurement units for storage in Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director are based on a KB equivalent of 1024 bytes [known as a kibibyte)KiB)], not 1000 bytes.
Therefore, a notation of MB actually means 1,048,576 (1024 x 1024) bytes in Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director.

Symptom It is observed if there are duplicate video items in a row in a playlist and a two-region template is used (video region on bottom and non-video region on top) the duplicate items after the first one will show blank screen on TV. This is only a 4310 issue, it does not occur with SV-4K and DMP-2K DMPs.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Create a template with 2 full screen regions, where bottom region is video and top is non-video.
2. Create a playlist (P1) and put several videos in it. Now duplicate one of the video several times so you will have for example (V1, V1, V1, V2, V3).
3. Create a playlist (P2) and put several transparent L-wrap PNGs in it.
4. Create a script and state and assign P1 to the bottom video region and P2 to the top non-video region.
5. Start the script and state.
Notice the second and third slot for V1 shows a blank screen. The first slot for V1 and other slots for V2 and V3 display correctly.
Workaround There is no workaround.

Symptom The widget preview does not correspond with the actual widget on an SV-4K display. Text spacing and text sizes change causing formatting issues.
Workaround There is no workaround.
CSCuw60818—Timer based script states change is delayed (DMP and UI) when timer count down reaches zero.
Symptom The widget preview does not correspond with the actual widget on an SV-4K display. Text spacing and text sizes change causing formatting issues.
Conditions These are some of the conditions when this defect occurs:
■When there are blocked scripts.
■When there are other large scripts starting.
■When there are a large number of running scripts.
Workaround The following things can be done to mitigate the risk of this defect occurring:
1. Cancel any blocked scripts. When scripts are scheduled make sure that if you manually start the script you also manually stop the script before the next scheduled script start time. Otherwise, the manually started script will continue to run and the next scheduled script will be blocked.
2. If possible, start all necessary scripts before an event. Avoid starting scripts during an event. Best practice is to complete and finalize script changes before an event.
3. Consider restructuring scripts to minimize the number of scripts needed for an event.
