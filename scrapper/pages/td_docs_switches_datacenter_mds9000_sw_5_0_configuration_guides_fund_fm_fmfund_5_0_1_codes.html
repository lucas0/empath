Chapter: Interface Nonoperational Reason Codes

Interface Nonoperational Reason Codes
If the administrative state for an interface is up and the operational state is down, the reason code differs based on the nonoperational reason code as described in Table C-1.
Table C-1 Reason Codes for Nonoperational States 
Reason Code
Description
Applicable Modes
Link failure or not connected
Physical layer link is not operational.
All
SFP not present
The small form-factor pluggable (SFP) hardware is not plugged in.
Initializing
The physical layer link is operational and the protocol initialization is in progress.
Reconfigure fabric in progress
The fabric is currently being reconfigured.
Offline
Cisco MDS SAN-OS waits for the specified R_A_TOV time before retrying initialization.
Inactive
The interface VSAN is deleted or is in a suspended state.
To make the interface operational, assign that port to a configured and active VSAN.
Hardware failure
A hardware failure is detected.
Error disabled
Error conditions require administrative attention. Interfaces may be error-disabled for various reasons. For example:
•Configuration failure.
•Incompatible buffer-to-buffer credit configuration.
To make the interface operational, you must first fix the error conditions causing this state; and next, administratively shut down or enable the interface.
Isolation due to ELP failure
Port negotiation failed.
Only E ports and TE ports
Isolation due to ESC failure
Port negotiation failed.
Isolation due to domain overlap
The Fibre Channel domains (fcdomain) overlap.
Isolation due to domain ID assignment failure
The assigned domain ID is not valid.
Isolation due to other side E port isolated
The E port at the other end of the link is isolated.
Isolation due to invalid fabric reconfiguration
The port is isolated due to fabric reconfiguration.
Isolation due to domain manager disabled
The fcdomain feature is disabled.
Isolation due to zone merge failure
The zone merge operation failed.
Isolation due to VSAN mismatch
The VSANs at both ends of an ISL are different.
Nonparticipating
FL ports cannot participate in loop operations. It may happen if more than one FL port exists in the same loop, in which case all but one FL port in that loop automatically enters nonparticipating mode.
Only FL ports and TL ports
PortChannel administratively down
The interfaces belonging to the PortChannel are down.
Only PortChannel interfaces
Suspended due to incompatible speed
The interfaces belonging to the PortChannel have incompatible speeds.
Suspended due to incompatible mode
The interfaces belonging to the PortChannel have incompatible modes.
Suspended due to incompatible remote switch WWN
An improper connection is detected. All interfaces in a PortChannel must be connected to the same pair of switches.
