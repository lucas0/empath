What's New in Cisco IOS XR Release 7.2.1
Software
NCS1K4-1.2TL-K9 L-Band Line Card
The NCS1K4-1.2TL-K9 (or 800 Gbps) L-band line card has eight usable QSFP-28 based client ports and two trunk ports. The trunk ports are capable of several line rates with fine control of modulation format, baud-rate, and forward error correction and are software configurable. The line card supports module and slice configurations. There is no support for L1 encryption, GMPLS, remote management using GCC, and smart licensing.
The features are:
The card provides up to eight 100GE or OTU4 client ports.
The client ports map to two trunk ports that operate on any rate between 200G and 400G with 50G increments.
The modulation format can be controlled between QPSK, 8 QAM, and 16 QAM.
The baud rate can be controlled between 31.5Gbd/s and 72Gbd/s.
The frequency range is 186.10 to 190.85 THz with a default value of 188.50 THz. Only 100 Mhz spacing is supported.
Hybrids between modulation formats can be configured to achieve 1/128 bits/symbol of granularity.
Forward Error Correction (FEC) with 27% overhead.
See Supported Line Cards.
Software Features on OTN-XP Card
LC Mode Configuration
When an OTN-XP card is installed in NCS 1004, the card is in POWERED_ON state, an alarm is raised, and the LED status is AMBER. A datapath mode must be configured using the LC mode CLI. The OTN-XP card does not have a default LC mode. After the LC mode is configured using the CLI, the card transitions to the OPERATIONAL state, the alarm clears, and the LED status turns to GREEN.
See LC Mode on OTN-XP Card.
The command, lc-module, was introduced.
AINS Configuration
You can configure the default AINS settings for all controllers on the OTN-XP card using the shared plane configuration CLI. The configuration is applied to any line card that is installed in NCS 1004. However, it is possible to override the default AINS settings on a specific controller using the CLI.
See Configuring AINS on OTN-XP Card.
Commands introduced:
ains-soak
automatic-in-service
Muxponder Configuration
The muxponder configuration supports two slices, 0 and 1. You can configure mxponder-slice 0, mxponder-slice 1, or both. Each mxponder-slice supports 10 client interfaces. The client-to-trunk mappings are as follows:
Mxponder-slice 0—Client ports 4, 5, and 2 are mapped to the trunk port 0.
Mxponder-slice 1—Client ports 7, 6, and 11 are mapped to the trunk port 1.
The trunk port is configured with 100G. Each client port consists of four lanes, 1, 2, 3, and 4. In the mapping shown above, lanes 3 and 4 can only be configured for ports 2 and 11. Each lane of the client port can be configured with OTU2, OTU2e, or 10GE port rates. It is not mandatory to configure all the 10 client lanes for a slice.
See Muxponder Configuration on OTN-XP Card.
The command, hw-module (OTN-XP Card), was introduced.
Thermal Safety Shutdown
When the data path device temperature of the OTN-XP card exceeds the critical threshold level of 108° Celsius, a sensor alarm is raised and the data path is shut down. This impacts traffic. However, the card is still operational.
See OTN-XP Line Card.
Smart Licensing
Smart Licensing is a cloud-based, software license management solution that enables you to automate time-consuming, manual licensing tasks. The solution allows you to easily track the status of your license and software usage trends.
The license calculation is based on 100G client bandwidth and is independent of the client type. The licensed OTN-XP Line Card PID is NCS1K4-OTN-XPL.
See Smart Licensing for OTN-XP Line Card.
GCC0 Support
The OTN-XP line card provides OTU interface that supports communication channels between adjacent network elements or nodes using GCC bytes in the OTN header. Remote node management is supported over the GCC interface. The node supports GCC0 on corresponding OTU2, OTU2e, and OTU4 interfaces. The node (Cisco FPGA) supports up to 22 GCC channels for each card.
See Understanding Remote Node Management Using GCC.
The command, controller OTU (OTN-XP Card), was introduced.
Laser Squelching Support
The laser squelching feature when enabled on the 10GE controllers, allows the laser to shut down if the trunk link fails. The SQUELCHED alarm is raised.
See Configuring Laser Squelching on OTN-XP Card.
The command, controller TenGigECtrlr (OTN-XP Card), was introduced.
Idle Insertion Support
The idle insertion feature allows you to hold the propagation of local faults on the trunk ports of the Ethernet controller. You can enable the feature by configuring the hold-off timer on the 10GE controllers.
The Loopback feature enables you configure internal and line loopbacks on the OTU2, OTU2e, OTU4, and 10GE Ethernet controllers.
See Enabling Idle Insertion on OTN-XP Card.
The command controller TenGigECtrlr (OTN-XP Card), was introduced.
PRBS Support on ODU2e Controller
Pseudo Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) feature enables you to perform data integrity checks between the NCS 1004 trunk links without enabling the actual client traffic.
This feature enables you to configure Optical Channel Payload Unit (OPU) on the ODU2e controller followed by the PRBS mode and the pattern. The supported PRBS pattern on the OTN- XP line card is invertedPN31.
See Configuring PRBS on OTN-XP Card.
The command, controller odu2e (OTN-XP Card), was introduced.
Software Features on 1.2T Card
FEC Mode Support for Coherent DSP Controller
The FEC states can be configured for the Coherent DSP Controller. The supported FEC states are EnhancedSD15 and EnhancedSD27 (default).
See Configuring FEC on CoherentDSP Controllers.
The command, controller coherentDSP, was modified.
1.2T Line Card Interoperability with the OTN-XP Card
NCS 1004 supports the OTN-XP card with 100G grey-optics support. The OTN-XP card can interoperate with the 1.2T card. In an interoperability scenario, the 1.2T card can serve as a client port and the OTN-XP card can serve as a trunk port. The trunk port can converge 10 x 10 G traffic and transmit as 100G traffic in the OTU4 mode. This OTU4 traffic can further be multiplexed to a higher bandwidth DWDM signal by connecting to the 1.2T OTU4 client interface.
See 1.2T Card Interoperability with OTN-XP Card.
Commands modified:
hw-module
hw-module (OTN-XP Card)
controller optics
BPSK Modulation Support
Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) feature enables you to configure the trunk rates using CLI, NETCONF YANG, and Open Config (OC) models. The supported trunk rates for the BPSK modulation are 50G, 100G, and 150G.
See Configuring the Trunk Rate for BPSK.
The command, hw-module, was modified.
IBGP Support over GCC
The Internal BGP (iBGP) support over GCC allows external devices to exchange BGP routes through the management interfaces of NCS 1004.
The iBGP over GCC feature enables you to configure VPN routing and forwarding (VRF) on the GCC management interfaces (port 0 and port1) of NCS 1004. The VRF enables traffic isolation between the management ports (port 0 and port1).
See iBGP Support Using GCC.
Commands modified:
interface gcc0
interface gcc2
Mixed Client Rate Support
In muxponder slice mode, both the slices can be configured with different client rates. For example, slice 0 can be configured with 100GE client rate and slice 1 can be configured with OTU4 client rate and the other way round. This provides flexibility for the card to simultaneously carry both the OTN and Ethernet client traffic across the two slices.
See Configuring the Card Mode.
The command, hw-module, was modified.
MAC Address Snooping on Client
MAC address snooping allows you to learn the MAC address of the neighbor, that is connected to the client ports. You can enable ARP snooping on all the client ports and learn the MAC address of neighbors through CLI. This feature overcomes the limitation that LLDP (Link Layer Discovery protocol) cannot be enabled in some networks.
When you enable or disable MAC address snooping on any slice, few packets are dropped during configuration.
See MAC Address Snooping on Client Ports.
The command, hw-module, was modified.
IKEv2 Certificate-Based Authentication
IKEv2 uses RSA digital signatures to authenticate peer devices before setting up SAs. RSA signatures employ a PKI-based method of authentication.
In public key cryptography, such as the RSA encryption system, each user has a key pair containing both a public and a private key. The keys act as complements, and anything encrypted with one of the keys can be decrypted with the other.
See Layer 1 Encryption.
The command, pki trustpoint, was modified.

EQUIPMENT_FAILURE
AVST_FAILURE
DATAPATH_DEV_FAILURE
LC-SUDI-CERT-VERIFICATION-FAILURE
