The tables in the Fabric Manager Information pane basically correspond to the dialog boxes that appear in Device Manager. However, while Fabric Manager tables show values for one or more switches, a Device Manager dialog box shows values for a single switch. Also, Device Manager provides more detailed information for verifying or troubleshooting device-specific configuration than Fabric Manager.
Device Manager Release 4.2 and later provides enhanced security using multiple perspectives (simple and advanced) allowing role based-access to its features. The Device Manager perspective filters out menu items that are not relevant to the user. Users with server admin role, can only access a subset of the fabric related features. The server admin role will not be able to manage Device Manager users or connected clients.
Device Manager Release 5.0 and later supports all the software features that are offered by Cisco NX-OS for managing Cisco MDS 9148 and 9124 Multilayer Fabric switches. Cisco MDS 9148 Multilayer Fabric Switch is a 48-port (1/2/4/8G) FC 1RU switch based on the Sabre ASIC and Cisco MDS 9124 Multilayer Fabric switch is a 1/2/4/8G switch module for HP BladeServer based on the Sabre ASIC. Device Manager and Fabric Manager allow you to discover, display, configure, monitor, and service both these new switches.
Support for Cisco Nexus 5000 Series Switches
Device Manager allows you to discover, display, configure, monitor, and service the following Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches:
•Cisco NX-OS Release 4.2(1)N2(1) supports the 2 RU (rack unit) Cisco Nexus 5020 switch. It has 40 10-Gigabit Ethernet host interfaces for its  downlink connection to servers or hosts and supports two optional expansion modules (GEMs). It does not support Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE).
•Cisco NX-OS Release 5.0(2)N1(1) supports the 1 RU (rack unit) Cisco Nexus 5548 switch. It has 32 10-Gigabit Ethernet and FCoE ports with small form-factor pluggable (SFP+) interface adapters for its  downlink connection to servers or hosts. You can put the optional following expansion modules into the Cisco Nexus 5548 switch:
–N55-M16P module—It has 16 10-Gigabit Ethernet and FCoE ports with SFP+ interface adapters for its uplink connections.
–N55-M8P8FP module—It has eight 8-Gbps Fibre Channel interfaces and eight 10-Gigabit Ethernet and FCoE ports with SFP+ interface adapters for its uplink connections.
Note You can configure Fibre Channel or FCoE on the switch by enabling the HTTP server application. Use the feature http-server command to enable the HTTP server on the switch.
Support for Cisco Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders
Device Manager supports the following Cisco Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders on a Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch that runs Cisco NX-OS Release 4.2(1)N2(1) or later releases:
•Cisco Nexus 2148T Fabric Extender—It has four 10-Gigabit Ethernet fabric interfaces for its uplink connection to the parent Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch and 48 1000BASE-T (1-Gigabit) Ethernet host interfaces for its downlink connection to servers or hosts.
