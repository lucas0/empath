Leverage your Cisco Learning Credits
What are Cisco Learning Credits?
Cisco Learning Credits (CLCs) are prepaid vouchers you can use to plan and pay for Cisco training and exams. They’re an ideal way to allocate training dollars toward immediate and long-term training goals.
What are the benefits?
Our Learning Partners offer classes that accept Learning Credits as payment to help you plan your training.
You can redeem Learning Credits for most Cisco Learning and Certification products, including instructor-led training.
You can plan for future training by purchasing Learning Credits and redeeming them directly with Cisco.
