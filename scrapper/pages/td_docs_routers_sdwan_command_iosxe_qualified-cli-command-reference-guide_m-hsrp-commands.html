Command History
Release
Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.1a
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
For usage guidelines, see the Cisco IOS XE standby <group-number> track command.
The following example shows how the tracking process is configured to track the IP-routing capability of serial interface 1/0. HSRP on GigabitEthernet interface 0/0/1 then registers with the tracking process to be informed of any changes to the IP-routing state of the serial interface 1/0. If the IP state on the serial interface 1/0 goes down, the priority of the HSRP group is reduced by 10.
If both the serial interfaces are operational, Router A will be the HSRP active router because it has the higher priority. However, if IP routing on the serial interface 1/0 in Router A fails, the HSRP group priority will be reduced and the Router B will take over as the active router, thus maintaining a default virtual gateway service to the hosts on the 10.1.0.0 subnet.
Device A Configuration
Device(config)# track 100 interface serial1/0 ip routing
Device(config-track)# exit
Device(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0/1
Device(config-if)# ip address 10.1.0.21 255.255.0.0
Device(config-if)# standby 1 ip 10.1.0.1
Device(config-if)# standby 1 preempt
Device(config-if)# standby 1 priority 105
Device(config-if)# standby 1 track 100 decrement 10
Device B Configuration
Device(config)# track 100 interface serial1/0 ip routing
Device(config-track)# exit
Device(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0/1
Device(config-if)# ip address 10.1.0.22 255.255.0.0
Device(config-if)# standby 1 ip 10.1.0.1
Device(config-if)# standby 1 preempt
Device(config-if)# standby 1 priority 11
Device(config-if)# standby 1 track 100 decrement 10
The following example shows how to change the configuration of a tracked object to include the HSRP Group Shutdown feature:
Device(config-if)# no standby 1 track 101 decrement 10
Device(config-if)# standby 1 track 101 shutdown
standby version
To change the version of the Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP), use the standby version command in interface configuration mode. To set the HSRP version to the default version (version 1), use the no form of this command.
standby version { 1 | 2 }
no standby version
Syntax Description
1
Specifies HSRP version 1.
2
Specifies HSRP version 2.
Command Default
HSRP version 1 is the default HSRP version.
Command Modes
Interface configuration (config-if)
Command History
Release
Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.1a
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
For usage guidelines, see the Cisco IOS XE standby <group-number> version command.
The no standby or no standby version commands resets the version to 1. If standby IPv6 groups are present on the interface, then the no standby command is rejected because v6 groups are not supported with version 1.
The following example shows how to configure HSRP version 2 on an GigabitEthernet interface 0/0/1 with a group number of 500:
Device(config)# interface GigabitEthernet 0/0/1
Device(config-if)# standby version 2
Device(config-if)# standby 500 ip 172.20.100.10 
Device(config-if)# standby 500 priority 110 
Device(config-if)# standby 500 preempt 
Device(config-if)# standby 500 timers 5 15
