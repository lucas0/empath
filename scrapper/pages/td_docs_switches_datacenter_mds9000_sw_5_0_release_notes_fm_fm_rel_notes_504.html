Introduction
Cisco Fabric Manager is the management tool for storage networking across all Cisco SAN and unified fabrics.
Cisco Fabric Manager provides comprehensive visibility for improved management and control of Cisco storage networks (2-, 4-, and 8-Gbps Fibre Channel and Fibre Channel over Ethernet [FCoE]), and it helps reduce overall total cost of ownership (TCO) and complexity through unified discovery of all Cisco Data Center 3.0 devices and through task automation and detailed reporting.
Cisco Fabric Manager provides centralized storage network management services, performance monitoring, federated reporting, troubleshooting tools, discovery, and configuration automation for the data center.
Cisco Fabric Manager includes these management applications:
Fabric Manager (client and server)
Fabric Manager standalone (FMSA)
Device Manager
Performance Manager
Fabric Manager Web Services
For detailed information on using Cisco Fabric Manager to configure a Cisco MDS 9000 Family switch or a Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch, refer to the feature-specific Cisco Fabric Manager Configuration Guides available at the following website:

Version Compatibility
As the features and capabilities of Cisco Fabric Manager continue to evolve, it is important to be aware of the software version compatibility information described in the following sections.
Compatibility with Cisco MDS 9000 Family Switches
Cisco Fabric Manager Release 5.0(4) can manage MDS 9000 switches that are running any NX-OS 4.2(x) release or any SAN-OS 3.3(x) release.
Any Fabric Manager 3.x release cannot fully manage switches that are running any MDS 9000 NX-OS 4.x release because Fabric Manager Release 3.x cannot manage features that are specific to the MDS 9000 NX-OS 4.x release series. Fabric Manager Release 3.3(x) can manage all legacy features in any SAN-OS 3.x, 2.x, and 1.x release.
In terms of testing and support, future releases of Cisco Fabric Manager 4.x will be backwards compatible with the two previous releases of MDS NX-OS 4.x and with the two highest releases in the SAN-OS 3.x release series.
Compatibility with Cisco Nexus 5000 Series Switches
Cisco Fabric Manager Release 5.0(4) has limited support for Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches running versions earlier than Release 4.0(1a)N1, because it does not support FCoE features on Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches running versions earlier than Release 4.0(1a)N1.

See for Table 8 for Cisco Fabric Manager resource requirements.
Fabric Manager Installation Process Overview
The following section presents the flow of the installation process at a high level. Review these steps before you begin the installation process:
1. Verify supported software. Cisco Fabric Manager and Device Manager have been tested with the software listed in Table 5 , html#13838"> Table 7 .
2. Ensure data migration when upgrading Cisco Fabric Manager from Cisco SAN-OS Releases 3.1(2b) and later.
If you are upgrading Cisco Fabric Manager in Cisco SAN-OS Releases 3.1(2b) and later, be aware that data is migrated from the Hypersonic HSQL database to either the PostgreSQL database or Oracle Database 10g Express during the installation. Data is also migrated from Oracle Database 10g Express to Oracle Database 10g Express. If you migrate the database from Oracle to Oracle, the schema is updated. Refer to Table 4 for information on the supported upgrade path.
3. Ensure data migration when upgrading Cisco Fabric Manager from releases prior to Cisco NX-OS Releases 3.1(2).
If you are upgrading Fabric Manager in a Cisco SAN-OS Release prior to 3.1(2b), be aware that data is migrated from the Hypersonic HSQL database to either the PostgreSQL database or the Oracle Database 10g Express during the installation. The Fabric Manager Installer installs the PostgreSQL database on Windows. If you want to install the PostgreSQL database on Solaris or Linux, or if you want to install the Oracle Database 10g Express database, follow the instructions in the “Installing Fabric Manager” section in the Cisco Fabric Manager Fundamentals Configuration Guide.
4. If you are upgrading a previous installation of Fabric Manager, make sure the previous installation is installed and running. Do not uninstall the previous version. If the previous version is uninstalled, the database will not be migrated and your server settings will not be preserved.
5. Select the database.
If you want to use the Oracle Database 10g Express, you must install the database and create a user name and password before continuing with the Fabric Manager installation.
We recommend the Oracle 11g Enterprise Edition for all users who are running Fabric Manager Server in a large environment.
If you want to install the PostgreSQL database, you must disable any security software you are running as PostgreSQL may not install certain folders or users. You must also log in as a Superuser before you start the installation.
6. Install Fabric Manager from the CD-ROM or from files that you download from cisco.com.
Installing Fabric Manager on Solaris
This section describes how to install Fabric Manager on Solaris.
To install Fabric Manager on Solaris, follow these steps:
Step 1 Set Java 1.5 or 1.6 to the path that is to be used for installing Fabric Manager.
Step 2 Install the database that is to be used with Fabric Manager.
Step 3 Copy the Fabric Manager jar file m9000-fm-5.0.4.jar from the CD-ROM to a folder on the Solaris workstation.
Step 4 Launch the installer using the following command:
java -Xms512m -Xmx512m -jar m9000-fm-5.0.4.jar
Step 5 Follow the onscreen instructions provided in the Fabric Manager management software setup wizard.
  NoteIf you have multiple Java Runtime Environments (JREs) installed, you must use the Java and Java Web Start of JRE version 1.6.0_21. To ensure that you use this version, do not accept the default javaws when your browser downloads fabricmanager.jnlp. Instead, choose the browse option and select javaws from the 1.6.0_21 Java installation. If you have multiple Java Runtime Environments (JREs) installed, you must use the Java and Java Web Start of JRE version 1.6.0_21. To ensure that you use this version, do not accept the default javaws when your browser downloads fabricmanager.jnlp. Instead, choose the browse option and select javaws from the 1.6.0_21 Java installation.
Installing Fabric Manager on Windows
This section describes how to install Fabric Manager on Windows.
NoteFabric Manager Server cannot be installed on an Active Directory Server when using PostgreSQL. Fabric Manager servers are domain controllers and cannot create local PostgreSQL user accounts. Fabric Manager Server cannot be installed on an Active Directory Server when using PostgreSQL. Fabric Manager servers are domain controllers and cannot create local PostgreSQL user accounts.
NoteIf you are running Fabric Manager Server on Windows and using the PostgreSQL database, you should examine your Windows Active Directory environment for organizational units (OUs) and make the change recommended below to ensure that Fabric Manager Server does not periodically stop working. If you are running Fabric Manager Server on Windows and using the PostgreSQL database, you should examine your Windows Active Directory environment for organizational units (OUs) and make the change recommended below to ensure that Fabric Manager Server does not periodically stop working.

On a Windows system, the Microsoft Active Directory applies a Group Policy Object (GPO) to the Fabric Manager Server. The GPO does not recognize the local user PostgreSQL because it is not in the GPO allow list. As a result, the GPO removes it, and the PostgreSQL database stops working.

To avoid this situation, you should move the Fabric Manager Server to its own OU and apply the same feature settings as the original OU, but remove the local user account to log in as a service.
If your server is running Terminal Services in Application mode, or if you are running Citrix Metaframe or any other variation, you need to enter the following command at the DOS prompt before installing Fabric Manager Server:
Step 1 Open a command-line prompt by selecting Start > Run , and then type cmd and press Return .
Step 2 At the command prompt, type user /install .
Note Do not close the command line window. This must remain open for the entire duration of the install.
The following is an example of the output of this command:
C:\Documents and Settings\user.domain>USER /INSTALL
User session is ready to install applications.
  Step 3 Follow all steps needed to install Fabric Manager, Fabric Manager Server, and Device Manager. See the instructions later in this section.
Step 4 When the installation is complete, at the command prompt, type user /execute and press Return . Then type exit and press Return .
The following is an example of the output of this command:
C:\Documents and Settings\user.domain>USER /execute
User session is ready to execute applications.
  To install Fabric Manager on Windows, follow these steps:
Step 1 Click the Install Management Software link.
Step 2 Choose Management Software > Cisco Fabric Manager .
Step 3 Click the Installing Fabric Manager link.
Step 4 Select the drive for your CD-ROM.
Step 5 Click the FM Installer link.
Step 6 Follow the onscreen instructions provided in the Fabric Manager Installer 5.0(4).
  NoteIf you have any folders open or Windows Explorer task windows open during the installation, you might see the following error message: If you have any folders open or Windows Explorer task windows open during the installation, you might see the following error message:

C:\Program Files\Cisco Systems\dcm\fm\help\shared\images\Thumbs.db (Access is denied)

To resolve this issue, close all open folders and open Windows Explorer task windows and restart the FM Installer.
Caution Windows 2000 is incompatible with Fabric Manager Release 5.0(4). If you install Fabric Manager in a Windows 2000 environment, you are at risk of having an unstable Fabric Manager. We recommend that you exit the installation and update your environment. See Table 5, Table 6, and Table 7 for the list of supported software that has been tested with Cisco Fabric Manager. See Table 4 for the supported upgrade paths for Fabric Manager.
To install Device Manager on your workstation, follow these steps:
Step 1 Enter the IP address of the switch in the Address field of your browser.
Step 2 Click the Cisco Device Manager link in the Device Manager installation window.
Step 3 Click Next to begin the installation.
Step 4 Follow the onscreen instructions to complete the installation of Device Manager.
  NoteIf you use a Java JDK instead of a JRE on Solaris, you might encounter a problem trying to install the Device Manager from a web browser. This can happen because the installer heap limit of 256 MB is not sufficient. If you have this problem, save the jnlp link as file, increase the heap limit to 512 MB, and run If you use a Java JDK instead of a JRE on Solaris, you might encounter a problem trying to install the Device Manager from a web browser. This can happen because the installer heap limit of 256 MB is not sufficient. If you have this problem, save the jnlp link as file, increase the heap limit to 512 MB, and run javaws element-manager.jnlp at the shell prompt.
Configuring a Cisco UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnect for Discovery by Cisco Fabric Manager
Cisco Fabric Manager cannot discover a Cisco UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnect until it has been properly configured. To configure a Cisco UCS 6100 Series before you use Cisco Fabric Manager to discover it, follow these steps:
Step 1 Enable SNMP on the Cisco UCS 6100 Series. SNMP is disabled by default.
Step 2 Identify whether Cisco Fabric Manager discovery is using SNMP version 2 or version 3.
a. If version 2 is in use, define the same community string on the Cisco UCS 6100 Series as is being used on the seed switch for Cisco Fabric Manager discovery.
b. If version 3 is in use, define the same SNMP user or credentials on the Cisco UCS 6100 Series as is being used on the seed switch for Cisco Fabric Manager discovery.
Step 3 Use Cisco Fabric Manager to discover or rediscover the fabric.
  NoteA Cisco UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnect is an NPV device and cannot be used as a seed switch in Cisco Fabric Manager. You should use a Cisco MDS 9000 Family switch or Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch that is connected to UCS Manager as the seed switch. A Cisco UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnect is an NPV device and cannot be used as a seed switch in Cisco Fabric Manager. You should use a Cisco MDS 9000 Family switch or Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch that is connected to UCS Manager as the seed switch.

XRC Acceleration License
The Cisco Extended Remote Copy (XRC) acceleration license activates FICON XRC acceleration on the Cisco MDS 9222i switch and on the MSM-18/4 in the Cisco MDS 9500 Series directors. One license per chassis is required. You must install the Mainframe Package and the SAN Extension over FCIP Package before you install the XRC acceleration license. The Mainframe Package enables the underlying FICON support, and the FCIP license or licenses enable the underlying FCIP support. XRC acceleration is not supported on the SSN-16.

General Limitations
This section describes general limitations related to Cisco Fabric Manager.
Solaris Windows Manager
Solaris Windows Manager does not resize windows correctly which affects some Device Manager screens. To resolve this, download and install the 119538-1 patch from Sun Microsystems. The patch (119538-17 GNONE 2.6.0: Windows Manager Patch, Generic, 2008/08/08) can be obtained from sunsolve.sun.com.
Upgrading to Recover Loss of Performance Manager Data
Caution You must upgrade to Fabric Manager Release 3.1(x) and then upgrade to a later release of Fabric Manager to avoid losing Performance Manager data. If data has been lost, follow the steps below to recover the data.
To recover lost data, follow these steps:
Step 1 Disable Performance Manager interpolation using Fabric Manager Web Client. Uncheck Interpolate missing statistics , then click Apply .
Step 2 Stop the Fabric Manager Server.
Step 3 Save the data file in the $INSTALL_DIR directory.
Step 4 Move the old RRD file into the $INSTALL_DIR/pm/db directory.
Step 5 Run $INSTALL_DIR/bin/pm.bat s .
Step 6 Restart Fabric Manager Server.
  Java Web Start
When using Java Web Start, it is recommended that you do not use an HTML cache or proxy server. You can use the Java Web Start Preferences panel to view or edit the proxy configuration. To do this, launch the Application Manager, either by clicking the desktop icon (Microsoft Windows), or type ./javaws in the Java Web Start installation directory (Solaris Operating Environment and Linux), and then select Edit > Preferences .
If you fail to change these settings, you may encounter installation issues regarding a version mismatch. If this occurs, you should clear your Java cache and retry.
Shortcuts Remain on Desktop After Uninstall
If you install Fabric Manager or Device Manager on Windows Vista, you may see the application shortcuts on your desktop, even after you uninstall the application. To remove the shortcuts, refresh the desktop.

Deleting Cisco SME Interfaces
A Cisco SME interface can be deleted from the cluster only after the interface is administratively shut down and all related tasks associated with the interface shutdown are complete.
Emulex Driver Version
In some instances, the Emulex driver version 8.1.10.9 may set the task attribute to HEAD_OF_QUEUE instead of SIMPLE_QUEUE. Certain tape drives do not accept this attribute and may reject these commands. The Emulex driver version 8.1.10.12 does not have this issue.
Compatibility of Fabric Manager and Data Mobility Manager
Cisco Fabric Manager in any MDS NX-OS 4.x release does not support Data Mobility Manager (DMM) in any SAN-OS 3.3(x) release or in any 3.2(x) release. To use the Cisco Fabric Manager GUI for DMM, both Fabric Manager and DMM must be running NX-OS or SAN-OS software from the same release series .
Using Fabric Manager for an In-Service Software Upgrade (ISSU)
If you are using Fabric Manager to perform an ISSU to NX-OS Release 5.0(1a) from any release prior to NX-OS Release 4.1(1a), the upgrade might fail. To work around this issue, perform the upgrade from the command-line interface using the install all command. DDTS CSCta94252, which is a duplicate of CSCsu68898, captures the details of this issue.
ISSU downgrades are not impacted.
Limitations for the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series Switches
This section lists the limitations related to Cisco Fabric Manager managing Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches.
Ethernet Configuration
You cannot configure physical Ethernet interfaces using Fabric Manager or Device Manager. You must configure physical Ethernet interfaces using CLI commands.
SPAN
You cannot use Device Manager to configure Ethernet or virtual Ethernet interfaces as SPAN source ports or to configure Ethernet interfaces as destination ports. The workaround is to configure SPAN using CLI commands.
Zoning
In the Edit Local Full Zone Database tool, virtual Fibre Channel interfaces must be specified using the Switch Port WWN method of adding members to a zone. In the Add Members to Zone dialog box, the Switch & Port method and the Domain & Port method are not supported for virtual Fibre Channel interfaces.
Limitations for the Cisco UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnect
This section lists the limitations related to Cisco Fabric Manager managing a Cisco UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnect.
Before Cisco Fabric Manager can discover a Cisco UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnect, you must configure the Cisco UCS 6100 Series. For more information, see the “Configuring a Cisco UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnect for Discovery by Cisco Fabric Manager” section.
Once the Cisco UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnect is configured and Cisco Fabric Manager discovers it, the following limitations apply:
Cisco Fabric Manager supports read-only access for a Cisco UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnect.
Cisco Fabric Manager or Device Manager cannot automatically register itself as a trap or event destination for a Cisco UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnect.
To work around the second of these two limitations, you must manually configure the IP address or port of Cisco Fabric Manager or Device Manager as event destinations on the Cisco UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnect.
Note These limitations are due to the fact that the Cisco UCS 6100 Series allows only read-only operations via SNMP which is the mechanism that Cisco Fabric Manager uses to discover, manage, and configure switches.
Caveats
This section lists the open and resolved caveats for this release.
Resolved Caveats
The following caveats are resolved in Cisco Fabric Manager Release 5.0(4):
CSCta06362
Symptom : When creating a report containing performance information, not all end devices are in the list, even though the template specifies all for the amount of devices to include. If a limit, such as 10, is set on the amount of devices to include, devices 1 to 10 are included.
Workaround : This issue is resolved.
CSCtc54974
Symptom : If you launch Device Manager from Fabric Manager, passwords are written in clear text to the Device Manager message log.
Workaround : This issue is resolved.
CSCtg25758
Symptom : The following sorting issues exist with flows:
– When all flows are enabled, you cannot search and identify a flow for a specific server.
– The sort function is not working.
– The web interface displays 20 entries, but when the list is exported to Excel, there are 40 entries and all others are zeros
Workaround : This issue is resolved.
CSCth12131
Symptom : The zone_member table in the Fabric Manager Server database table fills up because it is not being cleaned up.
Workaround : This issue is resolved.
CSCth22356
Symptom : The Fabric Manager Server zone_member table gets quite large for persisting fabrics with a large zone set and displays an error message.
Workaround : This issue is resolved.
CSCth26851
Symptom : If QoS is enabled and you are running zone QoS and you globally disable it from Fabric Manager Server or a script that runs the CLI commands simultaneously across the fabric, then you may not be able to activate the zone set after this event.
If you enter the show logging log command, you might see a message like the following:
switch# 2010 Jun 2 18:47:47 switch %ZONE-2-ZS_CHANGE_ACA_FAILED: %$VSAN 1%$ ACA failed : domain 0x1 returns NO_REASON_CODE
On Fabric Manager Server, you might see the following error message when you try to activate the zone set:
switch:zone: Qos needs to be enabled to perform this action
The symptom can occur because QoS gets disabled, but the QoS zone attribute parameters do not get cleaned up in the running configuration. This issue can occur in Basic and Enhanced Zoning Modes.
Workaround : This issue is resolved.
CSCth34473
Symptom : The Events tab in Cisco Fabric Manager might have large gaps of data such that several months worth of data is missing.
Workaround : This issue is resolved.
CSCth71245
Symptom : Fabric Manager Server does not forward the e-mail event for the linkDown trap, even though it does forward other events. Both event forwarding and EMC Call Home are enabled and one e-mail forwarding address is defined and shown by the web client.
Workaround : This issue is resolved.
CSCti13602
Symptom : When you create a custom report for SAN health, the performance manager allows you to select multiple VSANs from different fabrics. In the scope section, if you select an individual VSAN from one fabric, VSANs in the other fabric are grayed out as expected. If you select all VSANs by checking the SAN checkbox, all VSANs on both fabrics are selected. This symptom occurs because the wrong scope is selected for custom reports.
Workaround : This issue is resolved.
Open Caveats
The following caveats are open in Cisco Fabric Manager Release 5.0(4).
