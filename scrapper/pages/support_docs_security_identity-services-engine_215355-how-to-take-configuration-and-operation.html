Introduction
This document describes how to take On-Demand Configuration data and Operation data backup of the Identity Service Engine (ISE).
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:

Basic knowledge of the Identity Service Engine (ISE).
How to configure a Repository.
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:

Cisco Identity Service Engine 2.7
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Background Information
Another key strategy to assure the availability of ISE in the environment is having a solid backup strategy. There are two types of ISE backups: configuration backup and operational backup.
Cisco ISE allows you to back up data from the Primary PAN and from the Monitoring node. Back up can be done from the CLI or user interface.

Configuration data- Contains both application-specific and Cisco ADE operating system configuration data. Back up can be done via the Primary PAN using the GUI or CLI.

Operational Data- Contains monitoring and troubleshooting data. Back up can be done via the Primary PAN GUI or using the CLI for the Monitoring node.
The backups are stored in a repository and can be restored from the same repository. You can schedule backups to run automatically or you can run them manually on demand. You can view the status of a backup from either the GUI or the CLI, but you can view the status of a restore only from the CLI.
Caution: Cisco ISE does not support VMware snapshots for backing up ISE data. Using VMware snapshots or any third-party backup to back up ISE data results in stopping Cisco ISE services.
Configuration
Perform On-Demand ISE Configuration Data Backup From GUI
Step 1. Configure a repository refer How to configure Repository on ISE
Step 2. Login to ISE , Navigate to Administration > System > Backup & Restore, select Configuration Data Backup, click Backup Now, as shown in the image:
Step 3. Provide Backup Name, Repository Name and Encryption Key, and click Backup.
Tip: Ensure that you remember the encryption key.
Note: ISE configuration backup contains system and trusted certificates and it doesn't contain internal Certificate Authority (CA) certificates.
In order to backup the internal Certificate Authority (CA) store manually from the ISE CLI. Login to ISE Primary Admin Node (PAN)  node via SSH and run command application configure ise  > select option 7 to Export Internal CA Store.
ise/admin# application configure ise
