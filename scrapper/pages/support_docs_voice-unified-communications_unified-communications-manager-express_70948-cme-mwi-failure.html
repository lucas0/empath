Problem
Cisco Unity Express is able to set the MWI for phones located in the central site (see arrow A in Figure 1), but fails to turn on or turn off the MWI for all phones located in the remote site (see arrow B in Figure 1).
Solution
This problem is caused by an incorrect Cisco CallManager Express and Cisco CallManager Express/Cisco Unity Express configuration. This output shows the correct configuration:

!--- Enters telephony-service configuration mode.

telephony-service

!--- Enables the router to relay MWI information to remote Cisco IP phones.

Add this configuration on the central Cisco CallManager Express/Cisco Unity Express:
!--- Enters VoIP voice-service configuration mode.
