Chapter: Configuring Next-Generation High-Density PVDM3 Modules
Chapter Contents
The next-generation packet voice/data module (PVDM3) digital signal processor (DSP) modules provide up to four times the density (per slot) of existing audio applications on Cisco voice gateway routers. One universal DSP image for these DSP modules provides resources for time-division multiplexing-to-Internet Protocol (TDM-to-IP) gateway functionality for digital and analog interfaces, audio transcoding, and audio conferencing.
This enhanced DSP architecture accommodates a new packet-processing engine for rich-media voice applications and supports the TDM voice framework used by the PVDM2 module. The PVDM3 has a Gigabit Ethernet interface with a MultiGigabit Fabric to increase IP throughput, and a DSP hardware-based health monitor provides DSP failure detection that is ten times faster than existing technology.
The DSP Resource Manager has been enhanced so that PVDM3 modules can pool DSP resources and share DSP resources across voice service modules when there is a combination of PVDM2-based (using 5510 DSP) modules and PVDM3-based modules in one router. This supports the coexistence of PVDM2, PVDM2-DM, and PVDM3 modules on separate boards in the same router. However, any PVDM2 modules inadvertently deployed on the same voice card as PVDM3 modules are shut down.
Note Different-generation PVDM types can exist on different voice cards within the same router, but not on the same voice card. Each voice card in a router can support only PVDM2 or PVDM3 modules. There cannot be a combination of the two different PVDM types on the same voice card. There can be only one type of PVDM on the router motherboard—either PVDM2 or PVDM3 modules—not a combination of the two.

PVDM2s can reside on a network module within a router that supports PVDM3 modules on the motherboard, but PVDM2 and PVDM3 modules cannot be mixed on the network module, and PVDM2s and PVDM3s may not be mixed on the router motherboard.

Prerequisites for Configuring the PVDM3 Module on Cisco Voice Gateway Routers
To configure the PVDM3 Module on your Cisco 2900 or Cisco 3900 series voice gateway router, you must have Cisco IOS Release 15.0(1)M or a later release installed. The image must provide a voice-capable feature set.
To configure the PVDM3 Module on your Cisco 3925E or Cisco 3945E voice gateway router you must have Cisco IOS Release 15.1(1)T or later release installed. The image must provide a voice-capable feature set.
If you have installed the PVDM3 cards in your Cisco gateway, make certain that you have complied with the hardware installation instructions in Cisco 2900 Series and 3900 Series Integrated Services Routers Hardware Installation Guide.
Restrictions for Configuring the PVDM3 Module on Cisco Voice Gateway Routers
The PVDM3 card can only be installed and used on the following Cisco voice gateway routers:
Cisco 2901 and Cisco 2911 (each router supports up to two PVDM3 modules)
Cisco 2921 and Cisco 2951 (each router supports up to three PVDM3 modules)
Cisco 3925 and Cisco 3945 (each router supports up to four PVDM3 modules)
Cisco 3925E and Cisco 3945E (each router supports up to three PVDM3 modules)
All codecs that are supported on the PVDM2 are supported on the PVDM3, except that the PVDM3 does not support the G.723 (G.723.1 and G.723.1A) codecs. The PVDM2 can be used to provide G.723 codec support or the G.729 codec can be as an alternative on the PVDM3.
The PVDM3 DSP does not support Cisco Fax Relay. The PVDM2 (5510 DSP) does support Cisco Fax Relay.
The coexistence of PVDM2 and PVDM3 modules on the same motherboard is not supported. If these two modules are installed on the same motherboard, the PVDM2 is shut down.
Information About Configuring the PVDM3 Module on Cisco Voice Gateway Routers
To take full advantage of the PVDM3 cards on Cisco voice gateway routers, you should understand the following concepts:
DSP Resource Manager Enhancement and DSP Numbering
DSP Image for the PVDM3
DSP Farms
DSP Farm Profiles
Conferencing
Broadcast Fast Busy Tone for DSP Oversubscription
DSP Resource Manager Enhancement and DSP Numbering
Each PVDM3 DSP card can hold up to two devices, and each device can hold up to three DSP cores. The host recognizes each DSP card as one individual DSP and each physical DSP as a device. This virtual DSP concept provides a maximum of six DSPs per PVDM3. For backward compatibility for 5510 DSPs, the existing numbering scheme is maintained (see Table 1 ), and for PVDM3 DSPs, a new numbering scheme is applied (see Table 2 ).
Note The numbering schemes shown in Table 1 and Table 2 are examples only, and the DSP cards must be installed in the PVDM slots as shown for these sample numbering schemes to be correct. For more information about DSP and device numbering, see the documents listed in the “Additional References” section.

DSP Image for the PVDM3
The DSP image for the PVDM3 supports all features supported on PVDM2 except Cisco Fax Relay. The DSP image provides feature capability to implement the signal processing layer for a TDM-to-IP gateway:
TDM-to-IP gateway for voice telephony, including support for multicast conferencing through the mixing of multiple IP streams out a single TDM port.
Low-level processing of CAS from a T1/E1 interface through the use of digital signaling channels.
Control and low-level processing of the signaling for analog telephony interface implemented on Cisco’s voice interface card (VIC) hardware.
Support for Voice Band Data (VBD) through the use of upspeeding channels.
Support of facsimile using T.38 Fax Relay technology.
Support of high-speed modems (V.32 and V.34) using Modem Relay technology.
Interface with Secure Telephony (STU) phones using Secure Telephony over IP standard technology.
Support for interfacing VoIP channel to Land Mobile Radio (LMR) networks.
Support for secure VoIP through the implementation of SRTP for both encryption and authentication of RTP packets.
Support for text telephony (Baudot) using Text Relay technology.
The DSP image for the PVDM3 also provides a complete set of features to implement the signal processing layer of an IP-to-IP gateway and an IP-based conference server. Highlights of this functionality include:
G.711 transcoding for implementing a LAN-WAN gateway.
Universal Transcoding between any two voice codecs (narrowband or wideband).
Trans-scripting services for conversion between SRTP configurations or between secured and unsecured networks.
IP-based voice conferencing, including narrowband and wideband participants.
DSP Farms
DSP Farm is enhanced to support increased transcoding and conference density. For DSPs on PVDM3 modules, existing resource allocation and management mechanisms are enhanced:
For the PVDM3 DSP, participant-per-conference support is expanded to a maximum of 64. Note that this is supported only by low-complexity conference in Cisco IOS Release 15.0(1)M.
Transcoding or conferencing channel allocation for a new call is modified to achieve load balancing. This is supported by the capability to select one channel from one DSP at a time.
DSP Farm Profiles
DSP-farm profiles are created to allocate DSP-farm resources. Under the profile, you select the service type (conference, transcode, or Media Termination Point [MTP]), associate an application, and specify service-specific parameters such as codecs and maximum number of sessions. A DSP-farm profile allows you to group DSP resources based on the service type. Applications associated with the profile, such as SCCP, can use the resources allocated under the profile. You can configure multiple profiles for the same service, each of which can register with one Cisco Unified Communications Manager group. The profile ID and service type uniquely identify a profile, allowing the profile to uniquely map to a Cisco Unified Communications Manager group that contains a single pool of Cisco Unified Communications Manager servers.
Conferencing
Voice conferencing involves adding several parties to a phone conversation. In a traditional circuit-switched voice network, all voice traffic passes through a central device such as a PBX. Conference services are provided within this central device. In contrast, IP phones normally send voice signals directly between phones, without the need to go through a central device. Conference services, however, require a network-based conference bridge.
In an IP telephony network using Cisco Unified Communications Manager, the Conferencing and Transcoding for Voice Gateway Routers feature provides the conference-bridging service. Cisco Unified Communications Manager uses a DSP farm to mix voice streams from multiple participants into a single conference-call stream. The mixed stream is played out to all conference attendees, minus the voice of the receiving attendee.
The Ad Hoc and Meet Me conferencing features are supported (a conference can be either of these types):
Ad Hoc—The person controlling the conference presses the telephone conference button and adds callers one by one.
Meet Me—Participants call in to a central number and are joined in a single conference.
Participants whose end devices use different codec types are joined in a single conference; no additional transcoding resource is needed.
Broadcast Fast Busy Tone for DSP Oversubscription
There should always be a dial tone when a telephone is lifted. However, when DSP oversubscription occurs, and a caller goes off-hook, dead-air is received. With this feature, the caller receives a fast-busy tone instead of silence. This feature is not supported on application-controlled endpoints, Foreign Exchange Office (FXO) signaling endpoints, and BRI and Primary Rate Interface (PRI) endpoints.
The following lists the maximum number of different fast busy tone (specific to country) that can be supported by each PVDM type:
PVDM3-16 1
PVDM3-32 1
PVDM3-64 2
PVDM3-128 3
PVDM3-192 3
PVDM3-256 3
Prior to Cisco IOS Release 15.0(1)M, a new call attempt failed and dead silence occurred when DSPs were oversubscribed. When the PVDM3 is installed, a fast busy tone is broadcast to session application endpoints when DSP oversubscription occurs for both analog ports and digital ports, except PRI and BRI. FXO signaling and application controlled endpoints are not supported. This feature does not apply to insufficient DSP credits due to mid-call codec changes (while a call is already established).
Online Insertion and Removal
Cisco 3900 Series ISRs support only managed online insertion and removal. All voice ports and controllers should be shut down. Transcoding, conferencing, and MTP DSPfarm profiles need to be shut down in addition to the controller and voice port shutdown. Also, remove the DSP sharing (that is, DS0-group and DSPfarm sharing).
If the power efficiency management is configured on the module, the EnergyWise level must be set to 10 or online insertion and removal is not allowed.
Perform the following tasks for managed online insertion and removal on the Cisco 3900 Series ISRs:
1. Shut down the controller and voice ports.
2. Perform online insertion and removal.
3. Restart the controller and voice ports.

TDM Sharing/Pooling Configuration
Time-division multiplexing (TDM) sharing/pooling is only allowed among the same type of PVDMs. For example, if the motherboard has PVDM3 modules, and other voice cards have PVDM2 modules, the motherboard cannot share or pool DSP resources with other voice cards. If the motherboard has PVDM2 modules, and other voice cards also have PVDM2 modules, the existing CLI command will enable TDM sharing/pooling:
voice-card 0
dsp tdm pooling
  In the case of mixed types of PVDMs existing in the router (for example, the motherboard has PVDM3, another voice card has PVDM2, and a third voice card has no PVDM), there is a new CLI command under the voice card CLI that allows the voice card to choose which type of PVDM to use for TDM sharing/pooling:
voice-card 2
dsp tdm pooling type [PVDM2 | PVDM3]
  For more information about TDM sharing/pooling, see the documents listed in the “Additional References” section.
