Overview
Cisco ISE supports protocol standards like RADIUS, its associated RFC Standards, and TACACS+. For more information, see the ISE Community Resources.
Cisco ISE interoperates fully with third-party RADIUS devices that adhere to the standard protocols. Support for RADIUS functions depends on the device-specific implementation.
Cisco ISE interoperates fully with third-party TACACS+ client devices that adhere to the governing protocols. Support for TACACS+ functions depends on the device-specific implementation.

Note
This document lists only the devices that are validated with Cisco ISE. Hence, this is not the complete list of devices that are supported by Cisco ISE.
The following notations are used to mark the device support:
√ : Fully supported
X : Not supported
! : Limited support, some functionalities are not supported.

2 See the Cisco TrustSec Product Bulletin for a complete list of Cisco TrustSec feature support.
3 Minimum OS is the version in which the features got introduced.
4 The IOS 12.x version does not fully support the Posture and Guest flows because of CSCsx97093. As a workaround, when you configure URL redirect in Cisco ISE, assign a value to “coa-skip-logical-profile.”

5 Validated OS is the version tested for compatibility and stability.
6 See the Cisco TrustSec Product Bulletin for a complete list of Cisco TrustSec feature support.
Refer to the Cisco Wireless Solutions Software Compatibility Matrix for a complete list of supported operating systems.

Note
Due to CSCvi10594, IPv6 RADIUS CoA fails in AireOS Release 8.1 and later. As a workaround, you can use IPv4 RADIUS or downgrade Cisco Wireless LAN Controller to AireOS Release 8.0.

Note
Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs) and Wireless Service Modules (WiSMs) do not support downloadable ACLs (dACLs), but support named ACLs. Autonomous AP deployments do not support endpoint posturing. Profiling services are supported for 802.1X-authenticated WLANs starting from WLC release 7.0.116.0 and for MAB-authenticated WLANs starting from WLC 7.2.110.0. FlexConnect, previously known as Hybrid Remote Edge Access Point (HREAP) mode, is supported with central authentication configuration deployment starting from WLC 7.2.110.0. For additional details regarding FlexConnect support, refer to the release notes for the applicable wireless controller platform.

Note
For CoA to function properly, the minimum IOS version required for Cisco ISR series to work with SM-X-40G8M2X and SM-X-16G4M2X modules is IOS XE 17.4.1.
