Display the distribution of parameters using color as the dividing element, so you can see where one parameter ends and another begins. Display is limited to the top 10 distributions. In general, stacked bar charts use color to mark the boundary points between one data measurement and another.
Setup Assistant
The Setup Assistant guides you through a series of questions in a wizard-like interface retaining your responses and using them to configure Cisco ISE directly. It enables you to set up a basic working Cisco ISE configuration as a proof-of-concept for your network. Your answers to the questions impact these Cisco ISE features: authentication, authorization, profiling, posture, client provisioning, guest services, and support for personal devices.

Run the Setup Assistant
When you start Cisco ISE for the first time, you are prompted to run the Setup Assistant. If you choose not to run it then, you can run it again later.
Before you begin
To perform this task, you must be a Super Admin. You can only run the Setup Assistant on the standalone or Primary Administration Node (PAN).
Procedure
Step 1
Click Setup Assistant in the upper-right corner of the Admin portal.
Step 2
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the configuration.
Setup Assistant Overwrites Previous Configurations
Each time you run the Setup Assistant, Cisco ISE overwrites previous settings, which can critically impact your configuration in the following ways:
All authentication, authorization, client provisioning, and posture policies are deleted and replaced, including any that you added without using the Setup Assistant.
Other settings, such as policy elements and web portal customizations, are overwritten with any newly specified values. If you do not enter anything for the optional settings, the Setup Assistant resets them to their default values.
Identify Policy Requirements Page in Setup Assistant
Wired or Wireless
You must indicate whether you want to support wired or wireless connections, or both. If you are using a Cisco ISE Wireless License, the wired option is unavailable.
These choices impact the policies that Cisco ISE creates, and also dictate other required responses. For example, if you choose wired, you can also indicate whether your network supports IP phones.
You must also indicate whether or not the wired connections are monitored or if network access must be enforced based on compliance:
Monitor generates non-compliance logs and reports, but does not require that users or devices comply with the defined policies.
In monitoring mode, posture and guest policies are ignored. If you support wired connections in monitoring mode, the Setup Assistant disables the guest and posture choices on the next page to prevent unauthorized computer and guest access.
If you support wired and wireless connections, you can enable the guest and posture features, but they will apply only to the wireless connections. The wireless connections always runs in enforcement mode.
Enforce requires compliance with the defined policies.
Protected Subnets
You must indicate which subnets should are inaccessible by guests or noncompliant endpoints. This information is used when creating the downloadable ACLs.
Configure Network Access Service Page in Setup Assistant
User Authentication
Users belonging to these groups will be granted network access as employees and be allowed to create guest accounts using the Sponsor portal.
Internal users—If you choose to create an internal user, Cisco ISE creates a single user using the name you enter and assigns the user to the default Employee and ALL_ACCOUNTS user identity groups. You can verify this in the Administration > Identity Management > Identities > Users page after setup completes.
Because the Setup Assistant provides only the basic Cisco ISE configuration to demonstrate its functionality in your network, you cannot use it to import additional users into the internal user database. You can add additional internal users using the Admin portal after you complete the Setup Assistant.
Active Directory—If you choose to join the Active Directory domain, Cisco ISE adds the indicated AD domain and joins to it. After joining the domain, you must choose an Active Directory group. All users belonging to this group will be able to authenticate using Dot1x and create guests using the Sponsor portal. You can verify this from the Administration > Identity Management > External Identity Sources > Active Directory page after setup completes.
Posture Compliance
When you enable posture using the Setup Assistant, Cisco ISE checks for antispyware and antivirus definitions and installations on connected endpoints.
You must indicate whether you want to assess or assess and enforce posture compliance for employees and guests:
Assess generates reports about noncompliant users, but allows them to be authenticated.
Enforce prevents authentication.
If you want to force Cisco ISE to redirect noncompliant endpoints to a remediation server before granting network access, enter the proxy server IP address.
If you enable posture compliance, Cisco ISE will:
Download the Cisco NAC agents and update the Policy > Policy Elements > Results > Client Provisioning > Resources page.
Create the downloadable ACLs on the Policy > Policy Elements > Results > Authorization > Downloadable ACLs page. All DACLs created by the Setup Assistant include the prefix AutoGen, such as: AutoGen_DACL_PrePostureWired.
Create authorization profiles on the Policy > Policy Elements > Results > Authorization > Authorization Profiles page. Authorization profiles created by the Setup Assistant include the prefix AutoGen, such as: AutoGen_profile_Byod_CWA.
Create authorization conditions on the Policy > Policy Elements > Conditions > Authorization > Simple Conditions and Policy > Policy Elements > Conditions > Authorization > Compound Conditions pages. Authorization conditions created by the Setup Assistant include the prefix AutoGen, such as: AutoGen_condition_Android_Devices or AutoGen_condition_GuestWired.
Create client provisioning policies on the Policy > Client Provisioning page. Client provisioning policies created by the Setup Assistant include the prefix AutoGen, such as: AutoGen_Provisioning.
Download posture updates from the Administration > System > Settings > Posture > Updates page.
Create posture policies on the Policy > Posture page. Posture policies created by the Setup Assistant include the prefix AutoGen, such as: AutoGen_Policy_Check_For_AS_Definition_Mac_Employee.
Create authorization policies on the Policy > Authorization page. Authorization policies created by the Setup Assistant include the prefix AutoGen, such as: AutoGen_policy_Registered_Wireless_Devices.
Create authentication policies on the Policy > Authentication page. Authorization policies created by the Setup Assistant include the prefix AutoGen, such as: AutoGen_AuthNPolicy_MAB.
Endpoint Profiling
Endpoint profiling discovers, identifies, and determines the capabilities of all attached endpoints on your network. If you enable endpoint profiling, Cisco ISE will:
Enable these endpoint profiling features on the Administration > System > Deployment > Edit Node > Profiling Configuration page.
DHCP
RADIUS
Network Scan (NMAP)
SNMP Query Probes
Configure SNMP on the Administration > Network Resources > Network Devices page.
Proxy Settings
Cisco ISE uses the proxy server to download Cisco-defined posture checks and client provisioning resources required for assessing posture of endpoints and allowing personal devices on the network. If you configure these proxy settings, Cisco ISE will update the settings on the Administration > System > Settings > Proxy page.
Guest User Support
To support guest users, you must create a sponsor user. Cisco ISE creates a single user using the name you enter and assigns the user to the default ALL_ACCOUNTS user identity group, which defines the user as a sponsor user. You can verify this from the Administration > Identity Management > Identities > Userspage after setup completes.
If you add a simplified URL, Cisco ISE updates the Portal Name settings at the top of the Guest Access > Configure > Sponsor Portals > Edit page.
Support for Personal Devices
You can add a simplified URL for employees to use to access the My Devices portal, and Cisco ISE updates the Portal Namesettings at the top of the the Administration > Device Portal Management > My Devices > Edit page.
Web Portal Customizations
You can upload an image to use as a custom logo for the Sponsor, Guest, and My Devices portals. Cisco ISE also will upload the image to the appropriate page:
Guest portals:Guest Access > Configure > Guest Portals > Edit > Portal Page Customization.
Sponsor portals:Guest Access > Configure > Sponsor Portals > Edit > Portal Page Customization
Administration > Device Portal Management > My Devices > Edit > Portal Page Customization
Select Network Device Types Page in Setup Assistant
Switches and Wireless Controllers
Cisco ISE adds the switches and wireless controllers to the Administration > Network Resources > Network Devices page, updates the SNMP settings, and adds the RADIUS shared secret to the Authentication Settings option.
Depending on the choices you made previously, you must configure the switches and wireless controllers. Click the Wired or Wireless Network Diagram links to display sample network topologies that illustrate the required configuration details.

Cisco ISE Internationalization and Localization
Cisco ISE internationalization adapts the user interface for supported languages. Localization of the user interface incorporates locale-specific components and translated text. For Windows, MAC OSX, and Android devices, the native supplicant provisioning wizard can be used in any of the following supported languages.
In Cisco ISE, internalization and localization support focuses on support for non-English text in UTF-8 encoding to the end-user facing portals and on selective fields in the Admin portal.
Supported Languages
Support for UTF-8 Character Data Entry
Supported Languages
Cisco ISE, provides localization and internalization support for the following languages and browser locales:

Support for UTF-8 Character Data Entry
Cisco ISE fields that are exposed to the end user (through the Cisco client agent, or supplicants, or through the Sponsor, Guest, My Devices, and Client Provisioning portals) support UTF-8 character sets for all languages. UTF-8 is a multibyte-character encoding for the unicode character set, which includes many different language character sets, such as Hebrew, Sanskrit, and Arabic.
Character values are stored in UTF-8 in the administration configuration database, and the UTF-8 characters display correctly in reports and user interface components.
UTF-8 Credential Authentication
UTF-8 Policies and Posture Assessment
Cisco NAC and MAC Agent UTF-8 Support
UTF-8 Support for Messages Sent to Supplicant
Reports and Alerts UTF-8 Support
UTF-8 Character Support in the Portals
UTF-8 Support Outside the User Interface
Support for Importing and Exporting UTF-8 Values
UTF-8 Support on REST
UTF-8 Support for Identity Stores Authorization Data
UTF-8 Credential Authentication
Network access authentication supports UTF-8 username and password credentials. This includes RADIUS, EAP, RADIUS proxy, RADIUS token, and web authentication from the Guest and Administrative portal login authentications. UTF-8 support for user name and password applies to authentication against the local identity store as well as external identity stores.
UTF-8 authentication depends on the client supplicant that is used for network login. Some Windows native supplicants do not support UTF-8 credentials.

Note
RSA does not support UTF-8 users, hence UTF-8 authentication with RSA is not supported. Likewise, RSA servers, which are compatible with Cisco ISE, do not support UTF-8.
UTF-8 Policies and Posture Assessment
Policy rules in Cisco ISE that are conditioned on attribute values may include UTF-8 text. Rule evaluation supports UTF-8 attribute values. In addition, you can configure conditions with UTF-8 values through the Administrative portal.
Posture requirements can be modified as File, Application, and Service conditions based on a UTF-8 character set. This includes sending UTF-8 requirement values to the NAC agent. The NAC agent then assesses the endpoint accordingly, and reports UTF-8 values, when applicable.
Cisco NAC and MAC Agent UTF-8 Support
The Cisco NAC agent supports internationalization of text, messages, and any UTF-8 data that is exchanged with Cisco ISE. This includes requirement messages, requirement names, and file and process names that are used in conditions.
The following limitations apply:
UTF-8 support applies to Windows-based NAC agents only.
Cisco NAC and MAC agent interfaces currently do not support localization.
WebAgent does not support UTF-8 based rules and requirements.
If an acceptable use policy (AUP) is configured, the policy pages are provided on the client side, based on the browser locale and the set of languages that are specified in the configuration. You are responsible for providing a localized AUP bundle or site URL.
UTF-8 Support for Messages Sent to Supplicant
RSA prompts and messages are forwarded to the supplicant using a RADIUS attribute REPLY-MESSAGE, or within EAP data. If the text contains UTF-8 data, it is displayed by the supplicant, based on the client’s local operating system language support. Some Windows-native supplicants do not support UTF-8 credentials.
Cisco ISE prompts and messages may not be in sync with the locale of the client operating system on which the supplicant is running. You must align the end-user supplicant locale with the languages that are supported by Cisco ISE.
Reports and Alerts UTF-8 Support
Monitoring and troubleshooting reports and alerts support UTF-8 values for relevant attributes, for Cisco ISE supported languages, in the following ways:
Viewing live authentications
Viewing detailed pages of report records
Exporting and saving reports
Viewing the Cisco ISE dashboard
Viewing alert information
Viewing tcpdump data
UTF-8 Character Support in the Portals
Many more character sets are supported in Cisco ISE fields (UTF-8) than are currently supported for localizations in portals and end-user messages. For example, Cisco ISE does not support right-to-left languages, such as Hebrew or Arabic, even though the character sets themselves are supported.
The following table lists the fields in the Admin and end-user portals that support UTF-8 characters for data entry and viewing, with the following limitations:
Cisco ISE does not support guest usernames and passwords with UTF-8 characters.
Cisco ISE does not support UTF-8 characters in certificates.
Table 1. Admin Portal UTF-8 Character Fields

The passwords can be composed of any combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters (that include: “!”, “@”, “#”, “$”,“^”, “&”, “*”, “(“, and “)”. Password field accepts any characters including UTF-8 characters, but it doesn't accept control characters.
Some languages do not have uppercase or lower case alphabets. If your user password policy requires the user to enter a password with uppercase or lowercase characters, and if the user’s language does not support these characters, the user cannot set a password. For the user password field to support UTF-8 characters, in the user password policy page (Administration > Identity Management > Settings > User Password Policy), you must uncheck the following options:
Lowercase alphabetic characters
Uppercase alphabetic characters
Dictionary words, their characters in reverse order or their letters replaced with other characters cannot be used.

UTF-8 Support Outside the User Interface
This section contains the areas outside the Cisco ISE user interface that provide UTF-8 support.
Debug Log and CLI-Related UTF-8 Support
Attribute values and posture condition details appear in some debug logs; therefore, all debug logs accept UTF-8 values. You can download debug logs containing raw UTF-8 data that can be viewed with a UTF-8 supported viewer.
ACS Migration UTF-8 Support
Cisco ISE, allows for the migration of ACS UTF-8 configuration objects and values. Migration of some UTF-8 objects may not be supported by Cisco ISE UTF-8 languages, which might render some of the UTF-8 data that is provided during migration as unreadable using Administrative portal or report methods. You must convert unreadable UTF-8 values (that are migrated from ACS) into ASCII text. For more information about migrating from ACS to ISE, see the Cisco Secure ACS to Cisco ISE Migration Tool for your version of ISE.
Support for Importing and Exporting UTF-8 Values
The Admin and Sponsor portals support plain text and .csv files with UTF-8 values to be used when importing user account details. Exported files are provided as csv files.
UTF-8 Support on REST
UTF-8 values are supported on external REST communication. This applies to configurable items that have UTF-8 support in the Cisco ISE user interface, with the exception of admin authentication. Admin authentication on REST requires ASCII text credentials for login.
UTF-8 Support for Identity Stores Authorization Data
Cisco ISE allows Active Directory and LDAP to use UTF- 8 data in authorization policies for policy processing.
MAC Address Normalization
ISE supports normalization of MAC address entered by you in any of the following formats:
00-11-22-33-44-55
0011.2233.4455
00:11:22:33:44:55
001122334455
001122-334455
For the following ISE windows, you can provide full or partial MAC address:
Policy > Authorization
Policy > Policy Elements > Conditions > Authorization
Authentications > Filters (Endpoint and Identity columns)
Global Search
Operations > Reports > Reports Filters
Operations > Diagnostic Tools > General Tools > Endpoint Debug
For the following ISE windows, you should provide full MAC address (six octets separated by ‘:’ or ‘-’ or ‘.’):
Operations > Endpoint Protection Services Adaptive Network Control
Operations > Troubleshooting > Diagnostic Tools > General Tools > RADIUS Authentication Troubleshooting
Operations > Troubleshooting > Diagnostic Tools > General Tools > Posture Troubleshooting
Administration > Identities > Endpoints
Administration > System > Deployment
Administration > Logging > Collection Filter
REST APIs also support normalization of full MAC address.
Valid octet can contain only 0-9, a-f or A-F.
