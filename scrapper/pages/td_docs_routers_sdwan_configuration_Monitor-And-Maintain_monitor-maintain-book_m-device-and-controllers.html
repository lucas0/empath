Release Information
Description
Resource Monitoring on Cisco SD-WAN Controllers and Cisco vEdge Devices
Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.7.1
Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1
With this feature, you can configure usage watermarks for resources such as CPU, memory, and disk on Cisco SD-WAN controllers and Cisco vEdge devices. In addition, in Cisco vManage servers, you can configure watermarks to monitor disk read and write speeds. Devices poll the resource usage and notify events to Cisco vManage. Cisco vManage raises alarms to alert you about changes in resource usage, or disk read or write speed so that you can take the necessary corrective action.

Information About Resource Monitoring on Cisco SD-WAN Controllers and Cisco vEdge Devices
Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.7.1 and Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1 introduce a Monit-utility-based workflow for monitoring the usage of the CPU, memory, and disk on Cisco SD-WAN controllers and Cisco vEdge devices. While Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.6.x and earlier releases, and Cisco vManage Release 20.6.x and earlier releases allowed the monitoring of how these resources are being used, the monitoring and reporting was based on predefined watermarks and a default polling interval. From Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.7.1 and Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1, you can customize the watermarks and the polling interval as appropriate to the resources in your deployment.
To monitor the usage of the CPU, memory, and disk, you can configure high-usage, medium-usage, and low-usage watermarks, and how frequently a device must check and report resource usage to Cisco vManage. In addition, you can monitor the disk read and write speeds on Cisco vManage servers by configuring appropriate read and write watermarks and the polling interval. You can use CLI templates or log in to the device CLI to configure custom watermarks and polling intervals for various devices and controllers, as necessary.
Default Configuration
Devices and controllers have a default configuration for the usage watermarks and the polling interval for monitoring the CPU, memory, and disk usage:
High-usage-watermark: 90 percent
Medium-usage-watermark: 75 percent
Low-usage-watermark: 60 percent
Polling interval: 5 seconds
The disk read and write speeds on Cisco vManage do not have a default configuration and are only monitored after you configure the necessary watermarks and polling interval.
Polling, Events, and Alarms
Based on the configuration, the device or controller polls the resource usage through monit and notifies events based on the polled usage information to Cisco vManage. Cisco vManage compares the event information with the event information received for the previous polling interval. If Cisco vManage detects a change in resource usage, it raises an appropriate alarm.
Devices and controllers notify the following events to Cisco vManage:
CPU usage
Disk Usage
Memory Usage
Disk read speed (Cisco vManage only)
Disk write speed (Cisco vManage only)
The event notifications have the following severity and status based on how the polled usage value compares with the configured watermarks:
Comparison Severity Status
Above the high watermark Critical usage-critical
Between the medium and high watermarks Major usage-warning
Between the low and medium watermarks Minor usage-notice
Below the low watermark Minor usage-healthy
For more information on viewing and managing events, see Events.
Based on the events, Cisco vManage can raise the following types of alarms:
CPU Usage
Disk Usage
Memory Usage
Disk Read Speed (Cisco vManage only)
Disk Write Speed (Cisco vManage only)
The alarms map to the event status and severity as follows:
Alarm Severity Status
Critical (Red) Critical usage-critical
Major (Orange) Major usage-warning
Minor (Yellow) Minor usage-notice
Minor (Green) Minor usage-healthy
Initially, Cisco vManage raises an alarm when the event status is other than usage-healthy, indicating excessive resource usage.
If a subsequent event has the same status as the event Cisco vManage received previously, the alarm remains unchanged.
If a subsequent event is of lesser severity and indicates a healthier usage status, Cisco vManage raises an appropriate alarm. The new alarm clears the earlier higher-severity alarm.
Cisco vManage raises the Minor (Green) alarm only when the resource usage returns from a more severe state to the usage-healthy state. The Minor (Green) alarm indicates that the resource usage has returned to a normal level from an earlier excessive level.
For more information on viewing and managing alarms, see Alarms.
