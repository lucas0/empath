High Performance with Flexible Deployments
The Cisco Nexus 3524-X and 3524-XL Switches are well suited for mainstream top-of-rack (TOR) data center deployments. It offers wire-rate Layer 2 and Layer 3 switching with a comprehensive feature set, including Algo Boost technology, and ultra-low latency. All comes in a compact, cost effective, 1 rack unit (1 RU) form factor.
Features and capabilities
Algo Boost technology allows the Cisco Nexus 3524-X and 3524-XL to achieve exceptionally low latencies of 250 nanoseconds (ns) or less for all workloads. That includes unicast and multicast, and Layer 2 and 3, regardless of the features applied.
Benefits:
Multicast NAT and latency monitoring leads to simplified co-location integration and enhanced traffic visibility and troubleshooting.
Warp mode can further reduce latency to 190 ns for small to midsize Layer 2 and 3 deployments.
Warp SPAN helps enable stock market data delivery to trading servers in as little as 50 ns.
Advanced Active Buffer Monitoring helps take advantage of market volatility and handle micro bursts.
Technology supports Network Address Translation (NAT) for trade execution on any venue, without a latency penalty.
Embedded Remote SPAN with nanosecond timestamps helps monitor traffic with unparalleled precision.
Next-generation 3524-X offers 25% lower power consumption, further lowering operational costs.
Comprehensive Feature Set with Cisco NX-OS
The Cisco Nexus 3524-X and 3524 - XL are powered by the data-center-class Cisco NX-OS operating system.
Features include:
Full-featured unicast protocols including BGP, OSPF, EIGRP, and RIP
