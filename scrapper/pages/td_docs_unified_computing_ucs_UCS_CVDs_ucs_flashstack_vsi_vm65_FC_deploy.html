Executive Summary
Cisco Validated Designs consist of systems and solutions that are designed, tested, and documented to facilitate and improve customer deployments. These designs incorporate a wide range of technologies and products into a portfolio of solutions that have been developed to address the business needs of our customers.
This document details the design in the FlashStack Virtual Server Infrastructure Design Guide for VMware vSphere 6.5 U1, which describes a validated converged infrastructure jointly developed by Cisco and Pure Storage.  This solution covers the deployment of a predesigned, best-practice data center architecture with VMware vSphere built on the Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS), the Cisco Nexus® 9000 family of switches, Cisco MDS 9000 family of Fibre Channel switches, and Pure Storage FlashArray//X all flash storage configured for Fibre Channel based storage access.
When deployed, the architecture presents a robust infrastructure viable for a wide range of application workloads implemented as a virtual server infrastructure.

Solution Overview
Introduction
In the current industry there is a trend for pre-engineered solutions which standardize the data center infrastructure, offering the business operational efficiencies, agility and scale to address cloud, bimodal IT and their business.  Their challenge is complexity, diverse application support, efficiency and risk; all these are met by FlashStack with:
·         Reduced complexity and automatable infrastructure and easily deployed resources
·         Robust components capable of supporting high performance and high bandwidth virtualized applications
·         Efficiency through optimization of network bandwidth and in-line storage compression with de-duplication
·         Risk reduction at each level of the design with resiliency built into each touch point throughout
Cisco and Pure Storage have partnered to deliver this Cisco Validated Design, which uses best of breed storage, server and network components to serve as the foundation for virtualized workloads, enabling efficient architectural designs that can be quickly and confidently deployed. 
In this document we will describe a reference architecture detailing a Virtual Server Infrastructure composed of Cisco Nexus switches, Cisco UCS Compute, Cisco MDS Multilayer Fabric Switches and a Pure Storage FlashArray//X delivering a VMware vSphere 6.5 U1 hypervisor environment.

Purpose of this Document
This document details a step-by-step configuration and implementation guide for FlashStack, centered around the Cisco UCS 6332-16UP Fabric Interconnect and the Pure Storage FlashArray//X70.  These components are supported by the 100G capable Cisco Nexus 93180YC-EX switch and the Cisco MDS 9148S Multilayer fabric switch to deliver a Virtual Server infrastructure on Cisco UCS B200 M5 Blade Servers running VMware vSphere 6.5 U1. 
The design that will be implemented is discussed in the FlashStack Virtual Server Infrastructure Design Guide for VMware vSphere 6.5 U1 found at:
http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/UCS_CVDs/ucs_flashstack_vsi_vm65_M5_designs.html
Solution Summary
The FlashStack Virtual Server Infrastructure is a validated reference architecture, collaborated on by Cisco and Pure Storage, built to serve enterprise datacenters.  The solution is built to deliver a VMware vSphere based environment, leveraging the Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS), Cisco Nexus switches, Cisco MDS Multilayer Fabric switches, and Pure Storage FlashArray.
The architecture brings together a simple, wire once solution that is SAN booted from fibre channel and highly resilient at each layer of the design. This creates an infrastructure that is ideal for a variety of virtual application deployments that can reliably scale when growth is needed. 
Figure 1 shows the base physical architecture used in FlashStack Virtual Server Infrastructure.

  Configuration Guidelines
This document details the step-by-step configuration of a fully redundant and highly available Virtual Server Infrastructure built on Cisco and Pure Storage components.  References are made to which component is being configured with each step, either 01 or 02 or A and B. For example, controller-1 and controller-2 are used to identify the two controllers within the Pure Storage FlashArray//X that are provisioned with this document, and Cisco Nexus A or Cisco Nexus B identifies the pair of Cisco Nexus switches that are configured. The Cisco UCS fabric interconnects are similarly configured. Additionally, this document details the steps for provisioning multiple Cisco UCS hosts, and these examples are identified as: VM-Host-FC-01, VM-Host-FC-02 to represent infrastructure and production hosts deployed to the fabric interconnects in this document. Finally, to indicate that you should include information pertinent to your environment in a given step, <<text>> appears as part of the command structure. Refer to the following example during a configuration step for both Nexus switches:
b19-93180-1&2 (config)# ntp server <<var_oob_ntp>> use-vrf management
This document is intended to enable you to fully configure the customer environment. In this process, various steps require you to insert customer-specific naming conventions, IP addresses, and VLAN schemes, as well as to record appropriate MAC addresses. Table 2  describes the VLANs necessary for deployment as outlined in this guide, and Table 3  lists the virtual machines (VMs) necessary for deployment as outlined in this guide.

  FlashStack Cabling
This section details a cabling example for a FlashStack environment. To make connectivity clear in this example, the tables include both the local and remote port locations.
This document assumes that out-of-band management ports are plugged into an existing management infrastructure at the deployment site.  The upstream network from the Nexus 93180YC-EX switches is out of scope of this document, with only the assumption that these switches will connect to the upstream switch or switches with a vPC.
Figure 2 shows the cabling configuration used in this FlashStack design.

         The ports Eth1/49-1/54 of the 93180YC-EX switches are ALE (Application Leaf Engine) uplink ports and do not support auto-negotiation.  Devices connecting to these ports may need to have speed forced to 40GbE in interfaces on both sides.  For the connections shown above going to the 6332-16UP FIs, BiDi (QSFP-40G-SR-BD) transceivers were used between the 93180YC-EX switches and the Fabric Interconnects to establish the 40Gb connection.

  Network Switch Configuration
This section provides detailed instructions for the configuration of the Cisco Nexus 93180YC-EX switches used in this FlashStack solution.  Some changes may be appropriate for a customer’s environment, but care should be taken when stepping outside of these instructions as it may lead to an improper configuration.
Figure 3  Cisco Nexus Configuration Workflow
Physical Connectivity
Physical cabling should be completed by following the diagram and table references in the previous section referenced as FlashStack Cabling.
FlashStack Nexus Switch Configuration
The following procedures describe how to configure the Cisco Nexus switches for use in a base FlashStack environment.  This procedure assumes the use of Nexus 93180YC-EX switches running 7.0(3)I5(2).  Configuration on a differing model of Nexus 9000 series switch should be comparable, but may differ slightly with model and changes in NX-OS release.  The Cisco Nexus 93180YC-EX switch and NX-OS release were used in validation of this FlashStack solution, so the steps provided will reflect this model and release.
       The following procedure includes setup of NTP distribution on the In-Band Management VLAN. The interface-vlan feature and ntp commands are used to set this up. This procedure also assumes the default VRF will be used to route the In-Band Management VLAN.
Setting the NX-OS image on the Switch
The Cisco Nexus 93180YC-EX switch ships with the Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) and will need to be reinstalled with NX-OS standalone release specified in this document.  The NX-OS standalone software can be downloaded from software.cisco.com.  With the image downloaded, it can be transferred to the switches via a USB or SCP from the loader prompt.
For an SCP transfer, the image will need to be accessible from a host reachable by the management interface connected to the switch.  Login as admin and configure an available IP for the switch if it is not already on the network.  Copy the image over from the server it has been placed on and reload the switch.
(none)#
(none)# ifconfig eth0 inet <<var_nexus_A_mgmt_ip>> netmask <<var_oob_mgmt_mask>>
(none)# scp localadmin@192.168.164.155:/tmp/nxos.7.0.3.I5.2.bin /bootflash
(none)# reload
This command will reload the chassis, Proceed (y/n)? [n]: y
  During the reload, press Ctrl-C to interrupt the boot process and enter the loader prompt.  From the loader prompt, boot the image copied over.

    Set up the initial configuration for the Cisco Nexus B switch on <<var_nexus_B_hostname>>, by running through the same steps followed in the above configuration, making the appropriate substitutions for <<var_nexus_B_hostname>> and <<var_nexus_B_mgmt_ip>>.
Cisco Nexus Switch Configuration
Enable Features and Settings
To enable IP switching features, run the following commands on each Cisco Nexus:
b19-93180-1&2 (config)# feature lacp
b19-93180-1&2 (config)# feature vpc
b19-93180-1&2 (config)# feature interface-vlan
       The feature interface-vlan is an optional requirement if configuring an In-Band VLAN interface to redistribute NTP.  Layer-3 routing is possible with Nexus switches after setting this feature, but is not covered in this architecture.
Additionally, configure spanning tree and save the running configuration to start-up:
b19-93180-1&2 (config)# spanning-tree port type network default 
b19-93180-1&2 (config)# spanning-tree port type edge bpduguard default 
b19-93180-1&2 (config)# spanning-tree port type edge bpdufilter default 
Set Global Configurations
Run the following commands on both switches to set global configurations:
b19-93180-1&2 (config)# port-channel load-balance src-dst l4port
b19-93180-1&2 (config)# ip route 0.0.0.0/0 <<var_ib-mgmt-vlan_gateway>>
b19-93180-1&2 (config)# ntp server <<var_oob_ntp>> use-vrf management
b19-93180-1&2 (config)# ntp master 3
Create VLANs
Run the following commands on both switches to create VLANs:
b19-93180-1&2 (config)# vlan <<var_ib-mgmt_vlan_id>>
b19-93180-1&2 (config-vlan)# name IB-MGMT-VLAN
b19-93180-1&2 (config-vlan)# vlan <<var_native_vlan_id>>
b19-93180-1&2 (config-vlan)# name Native-VLAN
b19-93180-1&2 (config-vlan)# vlan <<var_vmotion_vlan_id>>
b19-93180-1&2 (config-vlan)# name vMotion-VLAN
b19-93180-1&2 (config-vlan)#  vlan <<var_application_vlan_id>>
b19-93180-1&2 (config-vlan)#  name VM-App1-VLAN
  Continue adding VLANs as appropriate to the customer’s environment.
Add Individual Port Descriptions for Troubleshooting
To add individual port descriptions for troubleshooting activity and verification for switch A, enter the following commands from the global configuration mode:
b19-93180-1(config)# interface Vlan115
b19-93180-1(config-if)# description In-Band NTP Redistribution Interface VLAN 115

b19-93180-2(config-if)# interface Ethernet1/54
b19-93180-2(config-if)# description vPC 154 connection to Upstream Network Switch B
Add NTP Distribution Interfaces
Optional VLAN interfaces are created on each Nexus switch to redistribute NTP to In-Band networks from their Out of Band network source.  For 93180YC-EX A this will be:
b19-93180-1(config)# ntp source <<var_nexus_A_ib_ip>>
b19-93180-1(config)# ntp master 3
b19-93180-1(config)# interface Vlan115
b19-93180-1(config)# ip route 0.0.0.0/0 <<var_ib_gateway_ip>>
b19-93180-1(config-if)# no shutdown
b19-93180-1(config-if)# no ip redirects
b19-93180-1(config-if)# ip address <<var_nexus_A_ib_ip>>/<<var_ib-mgmt_vlan_netmask_length>>
b19-93180-1(config-if)# no ipv6 redirects
  For 93180YC-EX B this will be:
b19-93180-2(config)# ntp source <<var_nexus_B_ib_ip>>
b19-93180-2(config)# ntp master 3
b19-93180-2(config)# interface Vlan115
b19-93180-1(config)# ip route 0.0.0.0/0 <<var_ib_gateway_ip>>
b19-93180-2(config-if)# no shutdown
b19-93180-2(config-if)# no ip redirects
b19-93180-2(config-if)# ip address <<var_nexus_A_ib_ip>>/<<var_ib-mgmt_vlan_netmask_length>>
b19-93180-2(config-if)# no ipv6 redirects
Create the vPC Domain
The vPC domain will be assigned a unique number from 1-1000 and will handle the vPC settings specified within the switches. To set the vPC domain configuration on 93180YC-EX A, run the following commands:
b19-93180-1(config)# vpc domain 10
b19-93180-1(config-vpc-domain)# peer-switch
b19-93180-1(config-vpc-domain)# role priority 10
b19-93180-1(config-vpc-domain)# peer-keepalive destination <<var_nexus_B_mgmt_ip>> source <<var_nexus_A_mgmt_ip>>
b19-93180-1(config-vpc-domain)# delay restore 150
b19-93180-1(config-vpc-domain)# peer-gateway
b19-93180-1(config-vpc-domain)# auto-recovery
b19-93180-1(config-vpc-domain)# ip arp synchronize
  On the 93180YC-EX B switch run these slightly differing commands, noting that role priority and peer-keepalive commands will differ from what was previously set:
b19-93180-2(config)# vpc domain 10
b19-93180-2(config-vpc-domain)# peer-switch
b19-93180-2(config-vpc-domain)# role priority 20
b19-93180-2(config-vpc-domain)# peer-keepalive destination <<var_nexus_A_mgmt_ip>> source <<var_nexus_B_mgmt_ip>>
b19-93180-2(config-vpc-domain)# delay restore 150
b19-93180-2(config-vpc-domain)# peer-gateway
b19-93180-2(config-vpc-domain)# auto-recovery
b19-93180-2(config-vpc-domain)# ip arp synchronize
Configure Port Channel Member Interfaces
On each switch, configure the Port Channel member interfaces that will be part of the vPC Peer Link and configure the vPC Peer Link:
b19-93180-1&2 (config)# int eth 1/1-2
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if-range)# channel-group 11 mode active
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if-range)# no shut
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if-range)# int port-channel 11
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if)# switchport mode trunk
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if)# switchport trunk native vlan 2
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if)# switchport trunk allowed vlan 115,200-203
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if)# vpc peer-link
Configure Virtual Port Channels
On each switch, configure the Port Channel member interfaces and the vPC Port Channels to the Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect and the upstream network switches:
Nexus Connection vPC to UCS Fabric A
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if)# int ethernet 1/51 
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if)# channel-group 151 mode active

b19-93180-1&2 (config-if)# spanning-tree port type edge trunk
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if)# mtu 9216
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if)# load-interval counter 3 60
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if)# vpc 152
Nexus Connection vPC to Upstream Network Switch A
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if)# interface Ethernet1/53
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if)# channel-group 153 mode active
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if)# no shut
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if)# int port-channel 153 
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if)# switchport mode trunk
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if)# switchport trunk native vlan 2
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if)# switchport trunk allowed vlan 115
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if)# vpc 153
Nexus Connection vPC to Upstream Network Switch B
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if)# interface Ethernet1/54
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if)# channel-group 154 mode active
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if)# no shut
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if)# int port-channel 154 
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if)# switchport mode trunk
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if)# switchport trunk native vlan 2
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if)# switchport trunk allowed vlan 115
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if)# int port-channel 154 
b19-93180-1&2 (config-if)# vpc 154
  *** Save all configuration to this point on both Nexus Switches ***
b19-93180-1&2 (config)# copy running-config startup-config
         vPC numbers have been chosen to correspond with the module and first port within a Port Channel, so in the example, having a first member of Ethernet 1/54 results in a vPC/Port Channel number of 154. This is optional, but can help in identifying port to Port Channel memberships.
FlashArray Storage Configuration
FlashArray Initial Configuration
The following information should be gathered to enable the installation and configuration of the FlashArray. An official representative of Pure Storage will help rack and configure the new installation of the FlashArray.
Table 13      FlashArray Setup Information
Global Array Settings
Array Name (Hostname for Pure Array):
  Virtual IP Address for Management:
  Physical IP Address for Management on Controller 0 (CT0):
  Physical IP Address for Management on Controller 1 (CT1):
  Netmask:
  Gateway IP Address:
  DNS Server IP Address(es):
  DNS Domain Suffix: (Optional)
  NTP Server IP Address or FQDN:
  Email Relay Server (SMTP Gateway IP address or FQDN): (Optional)
  Email Domain Name:
  Alert Email Recipients Address(es): (Optional)
  HTTP Proxy Server and Port (For Pure1): (Optional)
  Time Zone:
    When the FlashArray has completed initial configuration, it is important to configure the Cloud Assist phone-home connection in order to provide the best pro-active support experience possible. Furthermore, this will enable the analytics functionalities provided by Pure1.
The Support Connectivity sub-view allows you to view and manage the Purity remote assist, phone home, and log features.
The Remote Assist section displays the remote assist status as "Connected" or "Disconnected". By default, remote assist is disconnected. A connected remote assist status means that a remote assist session has been opened, allowing Pure Storage Support to connect to the array. Disconnect the remote assist session to close the session.
The Phone Home section manages the phone home facility. The phone home facility provides a secure direct link between the array and the Pure Storage Technical Support web site. The link is used to transmit log contents and alert messages to the Pure Storage Support team so that when diagnosis or remedial action is required, complete recent history about array performance and significant events is available.
By default, the phone home facility is enabled. If the phone home facility is enabled to send information automatically, Purity transmits log and alert information directly to Pure Storage Support via a secure network connection. Log contents are transmitted hourly and stored at the support web site, enabling detection of array performance and error rate trends. Alerts are reported immediately when they occur so that timely action can be taken.
Phone home logs can also be sent to Pure Storage Technical support on demand, with options including Today's Logs, Yesterday's Logs, or All Log History.
The Support Logs section allows you to download the Purity log contents of the specified controller to the current administrative workstation. Purity continuously logs a variety of array activities, including performance summaries, hardware and operating status reports, and administrative actions.
Adding an Alert Recipient
The Alerts sub-view is used to manage the list of addresses to which Purity delivers alert notifications, and the attributes of alert message delivery. You can designate up to 19 alert recipients. The Alert Recipients section displays a list of email addresses that are designated to receive Purity alert messages. Up to 20 alert recipients can be designated. The list includes the built-in flasharray-alerts@purestorage.com address, which cannot be deleted.
The Relay Host section displays the hostname or IP address of an SMTP relay host, if one is configured for the array. If you specify a relay host, Purity routes the email messages via the relay (mail forwarding) address rather than sending them directly to the alert recipient addresses.
In the Sender Domain section, the sender domain determines how Purity logs are parsed and treated by Pure Storage Support and Escalations. By default, the sender domain is set to the domain name please-configure.me.
It is crucial that you set the sender domain to the correct domain name. If the array is not a Pure Storage test array, set the sender domain to the actual customer domain name. For example, mycompany.com.
The email address that Purity uses to send alert messages includes the sender domain name and is comprised of the following components:
<Array_Name>-<Controller_Name>@<Sender_Domain_Name>.com
To add an alert recipient, complete the following steps:
1.        Select System > Configuration > Alerts.
2.       In the Alert Recipients section, click the menu icon and select Add Alert Recipient. The Create Alert User dialog box appears.
3.        In the email field, enter the email address of the alert recipient.

Configuring the Domain Name System (DNS) Server IP Addresses
To configure the DNS server IP addresses, complete the following steps:
1.        Select System > Configuration > Networking.
2.       In the DNS section, hover over the domain name and click the pencil icon. The Edit DNS dialog box appears.
3.        Complete the following fields:
a.        Domain: Specify the domain suffix to be appended by the array when doing DNS lookups.
b.       DNS#: Specify up to three DNS server IP addresses for Purity to use to resolve hostnames to IP addresses. Enter one IP address in each DNS# field. Purity queries the DNS servers in the order that the IP addresses are listed.
4.       Click Save.
Directory Service Sub-View
The Directory Service sub-view manages the integration of FlashArrays with an existing directory service. When the Directory Service sub-view is configured and enabled, the FlashArray leverages a directory service to perform user account and permission level searches. Configuring directory services is OPTIONAL.
The FlashArray is delivered with a single local user, named pureuser, with array-wide (Array Admin) permissions.
To support multiple FlashArray users, integrate the array with a directory service, such as Microsoft Active Directory or OpenLDAP.
Role-based access control is achieved by configuring groups in the directory that correspond to the following permission groups (roles) on the array:
·         Read Only Group. Read Only users have read-only privileges to run commands that convey the state of the array. Read Only uses cannot alter the state of the array.
·         Storage Admin Group. Storage Admin users have all the privileges of Read Only users, plus the ability to run commands related to storage operations, such as administering volumes, hosts, and host groups. Storage Admin users cannot perform operations that deal with global and system configurations.
·         Array Admin Group. Array Admin users have all the privileges of Storage Admin users, plus the ability to perform array-wide changes. In other words, Array Admin users can perform all FlashArray operations.
When a user connects to the FlashArray with a username other than pureuser, the array confirms the user's identity from the directory service. The response from the directory service includes the user's group, which Purity maps to a role on the array, granting access accordingly.
To configure the directory service settings, complete the following steps:
1.        Select System > Configuration > Directory Service.
2.       Configure the Directory Service fields:
a.        Enabled: Select the check box to leverage the directory service to perform user account and permission level searches.
b.       URI: Enter the comma-separated list of up to 30 URIs of the directory servers. The URI must include a URL scheme (ldap, or ldaps for LDAP over SSL), the hostname, and the domain. You can optionally specify a port. For example, ldap://ad.company.com configures the directory service with the hostname "ad" in the domain "company.com" while specifying the unencrypted LDAP protocol.
c.        Base DN: Enter the base distinguished name (DN) of the directory service. The Base DN is built from the domain and should consist only of domain components (DCs). For example, for ldap://ad.storage.company.com, the Base DN would be: “DC=storage,DC=company,DC=com”
d.       Bind User: Username used to bind to and query the directory. For Active Directory, enter the username - often referred to as sAMAccountName or User Logon Name - of the account that is used to perform directory lookups. The username cannot contain the characters " [ ] : ; | = + * ? < > / \, and cannot exceed 20 characters in length. For OpenLDAP, enter the full DN of the user. For example, "CN=John,OU=Users,DC=example,DC=com".
e.       Bind Password: Enter the password for the bind user account.
f.         Group Base: Enter the organizational unit (OU) to the configured groups in the directory tree. The Group Base consists of OUs that, when combined with the base DN attribute and the configured group CNs, complete the full Distinguished Name of each groups. The group base should specify "OU=" for each OU and multiple OUs should be separated by commas. The order of OUs should get larger in scope from left to right. In the following example, SANManagers contains the sub-organizational unit PureGroups: "OU=PureGroups,OU=SANManagers".
g.       Array Admin Group: Common Name (CN) of the directory service group containing administrators with full privileges to manage the FlashArray. Array Admin Group administrators have the same privileges as pureuser. The name should be the Common Name of the group without the "CN=" specifier. If the configured groups are not in the same OU, also specify the OU. For example, "pureadmins,OU=PureStorage", where pureadmins is the common name of the directory service group.
h.       Storage Admin Group: Common Name (CN) of the configured directory service group containing administrators with storage related privileges on the FlashArray. The name should be the Common Name of the group without the "CN=" specifier. If the configured groups are not in the same OU, also specify the OU. For example, "pureusers,OU=PureStorage", where pureusers is the common name of the directory service group.
i.         Read Only Group: Common Name (CN) of the configured directory service group containing users with read-only privileges on the FlashArray. The name should be the Common Name of the group without the "CN=" specifier. If the configured groups are not in the same OU, also specify the OU. For example, "purereadonly,OU=PureStorage", where purereadonly is the common name of the directory service group.
j.         Check Peer: Select the check box to validate the authenticity of the directory servers using the CA Certificate. If you enable Check Peer, you must provide a CA Certificate.
k.        CA Certificate: Enter the certificate of the issuing certificate authority. Only one certificate can be configured at a time, so the same certificate authority should be the issuer of all directory server certificates. The certificate must be PEM formatted (Base64 encoded) and include the "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" and "-----END CERTIFICATE-----" lines. The certificate cannot exceed 3000 characters in total length.
3.        Click Save.
4.       Click Test to test the configuration settings. The LDAP Test Results pop-up window appears. Green squares represent successful checks. Red squares represent failed checks.
SSL Certificate Sub-View
Purity creates a self-signed certificate and private key when you start the system for the first time. The SSL Certificate sub-view allows you to view and change certificate attributes, create a new self-signed certificate, construct certificate signing requests, import certificates and private keys, and export certificates.
Creating a self-signed certificate replaces the current certificate. When you create a self-signed certificate, include any attribute changes, specify the validity period of the new certificate, and optionally generate a new private key.
When you create the self-signed certificate, you can generate a private key and specify a different key size. If you do not generate a private key, the new certificate uses the existing key.
You can change the validity period of the new self-signed certificate. By default, self-signed certificates are valid for 3650 days.
CA-Signed Certificate
Certificate authorities (CA) are third party entities outside the organization that issue certificates. To obtain a CA certificate, you must first construct a certificate signing request (CSR) on the array.
The CSR represents a block of encrypted data specific to your organization. You can change the certificate attributes when you construct the CSR; otherwise, Purity will reuse the attributes of the current certificate (self-signed or imported) to construct the new one. Note that the certificate attribute changes will only be visible after you import the signed certificate from the CA.
Send the CSR to a certificate authority for signing. The certificate authority returns the SSL certificate for you to import. Verify that the signed certificate is PEM formatted (Base64 encoded), includes the "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" and "-----END CERTIFICATE-----" lines, and does not exceed 3000 characters in total length. When you import the certificate, also import the intermediate certificate if it is not bundled with the CA certificate.
If the certificate is signed with the CSR that was constructed on the current array and you did not change the private key, you do not need to import the key. However, if the CSR was not constructed on the current array or if the private key has changed since you constructed the CSR, you must import the private key. If the private key is encrypted, also specify the passphrase.

       When VMware ESXi 6.5 U1 has been installed on the hosts, the host Service Profiles can be unbound from the VM-Host-FC-A-vM and rebound to the VM-Host-FC-A Service Profile Template to remove the vMedia mapping from the host, to prevent issues at boot time if the HTTP source for the ESXi ISO is somehow not available.
MDS Fabric Zoning
This section continues the configuration of the Cisco MDS 9148S Multilayer Fabric Switches now that resources are attached, to provide zoning for supported devices.

FlashArray Storage Deployment
The Pure Storage FlashArray//X is accessible to the FlashStack, but no storage has been deployed at this point.  The storage to be deployed will include:
·         ESXi Fibre Channel Boot LUNs
·         VMFS Datastores
The FC Boot LUNs will need to be setup from the Pure Storage Web Portal, but the VMFS datastores can be directly provisioned from the vSphere Web Client after the Pure Storage vSphere Web Client Plugin has later on been registered with the vCenter.
Figure 7  FlashArray//X Storage Deployment Workflow
Host Registration
For Host registration, complete the following steps:
1.        Host entries can be made from the Pure Storage Web Portal from the STORAGE tab, by selecting the + box next to Hosts appearing in the left side column:
2.       After clicking the Create Host option, a pop-up will appear to create an individual host entry on the FlashArray:
3.        To create more than one host entry, click the Create Multiple… option, filling in the Name, Start Number, Count, and Number of Digits, with a “#” appearing in the name where an iterating number will appear:
4.       Click Create to add the hosts.
5.        For each host created, select the host from within the STORAGE tab, and click the Host Ports tab within the individual host view.  From the Host Ports tab select the gear icon drop-down and select Configure Fibre Channel WWNs:
6.       A pop-up will appear for Configure Fibre Channel WWNs for Host <host being configured>.  Within this pop-up, click the Enter WWNs Manually button and enter in the WWNs (WWPN) for each host previously recorded in Table 16 and Table 17:
7.        After adding the WWNs, click Confirm to add the Host Ports.  Repeat these steps for each host created.
Private Volumes for each ESXi Host
To create private volumes for each ESXi host, complete the following steps:
1.        Volumes can be provisioned from the Pure Storage Web Portal from the STORAGE tab, by clicking the + box next to Volumes appearing in the left side column:
2.       A pop-up will appear to create a volume on the FlashArray:
3.        To create more than one volume, click the Create Multiple… option, filling in the Name, Provisioned Size, Staring Number, Count, and Number of Digits, with a “#” appearing in the name where an iterating number will appear:
4.       Click Create to provision the volumes to be used as FC boot LUNs.
5.        Go back to the Hosts section under the STORAGE tab.  Click one of the hosts and select the gear icon drop-down within the Connected Volumes tab within that host.
6.       Within the drop-down of the gear icon, select Connect Volumes, and a pop-up will appear:
7.        Select the volume that has been provisioned for the host, click the + next to the volume and select Confirm to proceed.  Repeat the steps for connecting volumes for each of the host/volume pairs configured.
Host Groups
The Host entries allow for the individual boot LUNs to associate to each ESXi host, but the shared volumes to use as VM datastores need Host Groups to have those volumes shared amongst multiple hosts. 
To create a Host Group in the Pure Storage Web Portal, complete the following steps:
1.        Select the STORAGE tab and click the + box next to Hosts appearing in the left side column:
2.       Select the Create Host Group option and provide a name for the Host Group to be used by the ESXi cluster:
3.        With Hosts still selected within the STORAGE tab, click the gear icon drop-down within the Hosts tab of the Host Group created, and select Add Hosts:
4.       Select the + icon next to each host and click Confirm to add them to the Host Group:
vSphere Deployment
ESXi Installation
This section provides detailed instructions to install VMware ESXi 6.5 U1 in a FlashStack environment. After these procedures are completed, FC booted ESXi hosts will be configured.
Figure 8 vSphere Deployment Workflow
Several methods exist for installing ESXi in a VMware environment. These procedures focus on how to use the built-in keyboard, video, mouse (KVM) console and virtual media features in Cisco UCS Manager to map remote installation media to individual servers and connect to their boot logical unit numbers (LUNs).
Download Cisco Custom Image for ESXi 6.5 U1
The VMware Cisco Custom Image will be needed for use during installation by manual access to the UCS KVM vMedia, or through a vMedia Policy covered in a previous subsection.  If the Cisco Custom Image was not downloaded during the vMedia Policy setup, download it now by completing the following steps:
1.        Click the following link: VMware vSphere Hypervisor Cisco Custom Image (ESXi) 6.5 U1.
2.       You will need a user id and password on vmware.com to download this software.
3.        Download the .iso file.
Log in to Cisco UCS 6332-16UP Fabric Interconnect
The IP KVM enables the administrator to begin the installation of the operating system (OS) through remote media. It is necessary to log in to the UCS environment to run the IP KVM.
To log in to the Cisco UCS environment, complete the following steps:
1.        Open a web browser to https:// <<var_ucs_mgmt_vip>>
2.       Select the Launch UCS Manager Section in the HTML section to pull up the UCSM HTML5 GUI.
3.        Enter admin for the Username, and provide the password used during setup.
4.       Within the UCSM select Servers -> Service Profiles, and pick the first host provisioned, which should be named VM-Host-FC-01.
5.        Click the KVM Console option within Actions, and accept the KVM server certificate in the new window or browser tab that is spawned for the KVM session.
6.       Click the link within the new window or browser tab to load the KVM client application.
Set Up VMware ESXi Installation
       Skip this step if you are using vMedia policies.  ISO file will already be connected to KVM.
To prepare the server for the OS installation, complete the following steps on each ESXi host:
1.        In the KVM window, click Virtual Media icon  in the upper right of the screen.
2.       Click Activate Virtual Devices
3.        Click Virtual Media again and select Map CD/DVD.
4.       Browse to the ESXi installer ISO image file and click Open.
5.        Click Map Device.
6.       Click the KVM tab to monitor the server boot.
7.        Boot the server by selecting Boot Server and clicking OK, then click OK again.
Install ESXi
To install VMware ESXi to the FC bootable LUN of the hosts, complete the following steps on each host:
1.        On reboot, the machine detects the presence of the ESXi installation media. Select the ESXi installer from the boot menu that is displayed.
2.       After the installer is finished loading, press Enter to continue with the installation.
3.        Read and accept the end-user license agreement (EULA). Press F11 to accept and continue.
4.       Select the LUN that was previously set up as the installation disk for ESXi and press Enter to continue with the installation.
5.        Select the appropriate keyboard layout and press Enter.
6.       Enter and confirm the root password and press Enter.
7.        The installer issues a warning that the selected disk will be repartitioned. Press F11 to continue with the installation.
8.       After the installation is complete, if using locally mapped Virtual Media, click the Virtual Media tab and clear the checkmark next to the ESXi installation media. Click Yes.
       The ESXi installation image must be unmapped to make sure that the server reboots into ESXi and not into the installer.  If using a vMedia Policy, this will be unnecessary as the vMedia will appear after the installed OS.
9.       From the KVM window, press Enter to reboot the server.
Set Up Management Networking for ESXi Hosts
Adding a management network for each VMware host is necessary for managing the host. To add a management network for the VMware hosts, complete the following steps on each ESXi host:

1.        Connect to the vSphere Web Client and click Hosts and Clusters from the left side Navigator window, or the Hosts and Clusters icon from the Home center window.
2.       Right-click the vCenter icon and select New Datacenter… from the drop-down options.
3.        From the New Datacenter pop-up dialogue enter in a Datacenter name and click OK.
Create VMware vDS for Infrastructure and Application Traffic
The VMware vDS setup will consist of two vDS that are separated for Infrastructure use versus Application traffic. 
FlashStack Infrastructure vDS
To configure the first VMware vDS, complete the following steps:
1.        Connect to the vSphere Web Client and click Networking from the left side Navigator window, or the Networking icon from the Home center window.
2.       Right-click the FlashStack-VSI datacenter and select Distributed Switch > New Distributed Switch…
3.        Give the Distributed Switch a descriptive name and click Next.
4.       Make sure Distributed switch: 6.5.0 is selected and click Next.
5.        Leave the Number of uplinks at 4. If VMware Network I/O Control is to be used for Quality of Service, leave Network I/O Control Enabled.  Otherwise, Disable Network I/O Control. Enter IB-Mgmt for the name of the default Port group to be created. Click Next.
6.       Review the information and click Finish to complete creating the vDS.
7.        Right-click the newly created vDS on the left, and select Settings -> Edit Settings…
8.       Click the Advanced option on the left side of the Edit Settings window, and adjust the MTU from 1500 to 9000.
9.       Click OK to save the changes.
10.    On the left, expand the FlashStack VSI datacenter and the newly created vDS. 
11.     Right-click the IB-Mgmt Distributed Port Group, and select Edit Settings…
12.    Click VLAN, changing VLAN type from None to VLAN, and enter in the appropriate VLAN number for the IB-Mgmt network.
13.     Click the Teaming and Failover and move the Uplinks 3 and 4 to the Unused uplinks state, and move the Uplink 2 to the Standby uplinks state.
       Movement of Uplink 2 to standby is guiding Management traffic to stay within the A side fabric contained within Uplink 1 to prevent unnecessary traffic hops up into the Nexus switch to traverse between fabrics.  Uplinks 3 and 4 are set as unused as these are the vMotion vNICs and will be used by the other Distributed Port Group in this vDS.
14.    Click OK to save the changes.
15.     Right-click the infrastructure vDS (Infra-DSwitch), and select Distributed Port Group -> New Distributed Port Group…
16.    Name the new Port Group vMotion and click Next.
17.     Change the VLAN type from None to VLAN, select the VLAN ID appropriate for your vMotion traffic, and select the Customize default policies configuration check box under the Advanced section.
18.    Click Next.
19.    Click Next through the Security and Traffic Shaping sections.
20.    Within the Teaming and failover section, move Uplinks 1 and 2 to the Unused uplinks section, and move Uplink 3 to the Standby uplinks section.
       Teaming for the vMotion Distributed Port Group will be a mirror of teaming on the Infrastructure Distributed Port group.  Uplinks 1 and 2 are unused because they are used by the Infrastructure Distributed Port group, and Uplink 3 will be moved to standby to guide vMotion traffic to stay within the B side fabric contained within Uplink 4.
21.    Click Next.
22.    Click Next past Monitoring, Miscellaneous, and click Edit additional settings sections.
23.    Review the Ready to complete section.
24.    Click Finish to create the Distributed Port Group.
FlashStack Application vDS

1.        Right-click the FlashStack-VSI Datacenter and select Distributed Switch -> New Distributed Switch… to create the Application vDS.
2.       Provide a name for the vDS (App-DSwitch), and click Next.
3.        Make sure Distributed switch: 6.5.0 is selected and click Next.
4.       Change the Number of uplinks to 2. If VMware Network I/O Control is to be used for Quality of Service, leave Network I/O Control Enabled.  Otherwise, Disable Network I/O Control. Enter App-201 for the name of the default Port group to be created. Click Next.
5.        Review the information and click Finish to complete creating the vDS.
6.       Right-click the newly created App-DSwitch vDS, and select Settings -> Edit Settings…
7.        Click the Advanced option for the Edit Settings window and change the MTU from 1500 to 9000.
8.       Click OK to save the changes.
9.       Right-click the App-201 Distributed Port Group, and select Edit Settings…
10.    Click VLAN, changing VLAN type from None to VLAN, and enter in the appropriate VLAN number for the first application network.
       The application Distributed Port Groups will not need to adjust their NIC Teaming as they will be Active/Active within the two vNICs uplinks associated to the App-DSwitch, using the default VMware Route based on originating virtual port load balancing algorithm.
11.     Click OK to save the changes.
12.    Right-Click the App-DSwitch, selecting Distributed Port Group -> New Distributed Port Group… for any additional application networks to be created, setting the appropriate VLAN for each new Distributed Port Group.
Add the VMware ESXi Hosts Using the VMware vSphere Web Client
To add the VMware ESXi Hosts using the VMware vSphere Web Client, complete the following steps:
1.        From the Hosts and Clusters tab, right-click the new or existing Datacenter within the Navigation window, and select New Cluster… from the drop-down options.

12.    Confirm the Summary dialogue and add the ESXi host to the cluster by clicking Next.
13.     Repeat these steps for each ESXi host to be added to the cluster.
Pure Storage vSphere Web Client Plugin
The Pure Storage vSphere Web Client Plugin will be accessible through the vSphere Web Client after registration through the Pure Storage Web Portal. 
       The Purity 4.10.5 release comes with the 2.5.1 version of the plugin, which will work, but will not allow provisioning of VMFS-6 datastores.  The example below shows an early release of the 3.0 plugin, which can be installed to the FlashArray by submitting a support request with Pure Support asking for the plugin upgrade.  This is not a requirement, but in the absence of the upgraded plugin, LUNs would need to be manually provisioned through the Purity Web Console, and VMFS-6 datastore would be created from the LUNs within vCenter.
The vCenter server for this environment should be in place on an independent management cluster that is accessible to the In-Band management network the ESXi hosts will be deployed to.
If a new dedicated vCenter server is required for your environment, please follow the instructions from VMware found at: https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/vsphere-esxi-vcenter-server-65-installation-setup-guide.pdf.
To access the Pure Storage vSphere Web Client Plugin, complete the following steps:
1.        Go to System -> Plugins -> vSphere:
2.       Enter the vCenter Host IP or FQDN, the Administrator User to connect with, the password for the Administrator User, and click Connect.  Once connected, select the Install button to register the plugin.
3.        With the plugin registered, connect to the vSphere Web Client and select the Pure Storage Plugin from the Home page:
4.       Click Add FlashArray within the options under the Object tab.
       The Sample FlashArray entry can optionally be removed.
5.        Enter the FlashArray Name, FlashArray URL, Username and Password in the Add FlashArray pop-up window.
6.       Click Add to register the FlashArray//X within the plugin.
Add Datastores
These next steps add a datastore to place VMs on the FlashArray//X and optionally a second datastore for keeping their swapfiles.
       A dedicated swapfile location will not provide a performance increase over the existing all flash datastores created from the FlashArray//X, but can be useful to have these files in a separate location to have them excluded from snapshots and backups.
1.        Right-click the cluster and select the Pure Storage -> Create Datastore option from the drop-down.
2.       Give the Datastore Name a value appropriate for VM store in the environment, select a starting size for the Datastore Size, click the VMFS 6 selection under VMFS Options, and click Create to provision the volume.
3.        Optionally, repeat these similar steps to create a swap datastore to be used by the ESXi hosts.  Right-click the cluster and select the Pure Storage -> Create Datastore option from the drop-down.
4.       Give the Datastore Name a value appropriate for VM swapfiles on the ESXi host, select a starting size for the Datastore Size, click the VMFS 6 selection under VMFS Options, and click Create to provision the volume.
Configure ESXi Hosts in the Cluster
Configure ESXi Settings
A couple of base settings are needed for stability of the vSphere environment, as well as optional enablement of SSH connectivity to each host for the updating of drivers.
To configure ESXi settings, complete the following steps:
1.        Select the first ESXi host to configure with standard settings.
2.       Select the Configure tab and select Time Configuration within the options on the left under System, and click Edit within Time Configuration.
3.        Select Use Network Time Protocol (Enable NTP client), enter <<var_nexus_A_ib_ip>>, <<var_nexus_A_ib_ip>> for the NTP Servers, select Start and stop with host for NTP Service Startup Policy, and click Start within NTP Service Status.  Click OK to submit the changes.
4.       (Optional) Click Security Profile within the Configure tab under the System section for the host.
       Security Profile settings of ESXi Shell and SSH are enabled for the potential update of the nenic and fnic drivers later.  These steps are unnecessary if using VMware Update Manager and these drivers are being handled by being included into a configured baseline.  If SSH is enabled for updates, it is recommended to later disable this service if it is considered a security risk in the environment.
5.        Scroll down to the Services section within Security Profile and click the Edit button.
6.       Select the ESXi Shell entry, change the Startup Policy to Start and stop with port usage, and click Start.  Repeat these steps for the SSH entry. Click OK.
7.        If an optional ESXi swap datastore was configured earlier, click System Swap the System section within the Configure tab and click Edit.
8.       Checkmark the Can use datastore option, and from the drop-down select the ESXi swap datastore that was configured.   Click OK.
9.       Repeat these steps on each ESXi host being added into the cluster.

Cisco UCS Manager Plug-in for VMware vSphere Web Client
The Cisco UCS Manager Plug-in for VMware vSphere Web Client allows administration of UCS domains through the VMware’s vCenter administrative interface.  The capabilities of the plug-in include:
·         View Cisco UCS physical hierarchy
·         View inventory, installed firmware, faults, power and temperature statistics
·         Map the ESXi host to the physical server
·         Manage firmware for Cisco UCS B and C series servers
·         Launch the Cisco UCS Manager GUI
·         Launch the KVM consoles of UCS servers
·         Switch the existing state of the locator LEDs
The installation is only valid for VMware vCenter 5.5 or higher, and will require revisions of .NET Framework 4.5 and VMware PowerCLI 5.1 or greater.
Cisco UCS Manager Plug-in Installation
To begin the plug-in installation on a Windows system that meets the previously stated requirements, complete the following steps:
1.        Download the plugin and registration tool from: https://software.cisco.com/download/release.html?mdfid=286282669&catid=282558030&softwareid=286282010&release=2.0.3
2.       Place the downloaded ucs-vcplugin-2.0.3.zip file on an accessible web server previously used for hosting the VMware ESXi ISO.
3.        Extract the Cisco_UCS_Plugin_Registration_Tool_1_1_3.zip and open the executable file within it.
4.       Leave Register Plugin selected for the Action, and fill in:
a.        IP/Hostname
b.       Username
c.        Password
d.       URL that plugin has been uploaded to
5.        A pop-up will appear explaining that ‘allowHttp=true’ will need to be added to the webclient.properties file on the VCSA in the /etc/vmware/vsphere-client directory.
6.       Take care of this issue after the plugin has been registered, click OK to close the Information dialogue box.
7.        Click Submit to register the plugin with the vCenter Server Appliance.
8.       To resolve the change needed for the HTTP download of the vSphere Web Client launch, connect to the VCSA with ssh using the root account and edit /etc/vmware/vsphere-client/webclient.properties to add “allowHttp=true” or type:
echo ’allowHttp=true’ >> /etc/vmware/vsphere-client/webclient.properties
       This will add “allowHttp=true” to the end of the webclient.properties file.  Make sure to use two greater than symbols “>>” to append to the end of the configuration file, a single greater than symbol will replace the entire pre-existing file with what has been sent with the echo command.
9.       Reboot the VCSA.
FlashStack UCS Domain Registration
Registration of the FlashStack UCS Domain can now be performed. The account used will correlate to the permissions allowed to the plugin, admin will be used in our example, but a read only account could be used with the plugin if that was appropriate for the environment.
To register the UCS Domain, complete the following steps:
1.        Opening up the vSphere Web Client.
2.       Select the Home from the Navigator or drop-down options, and double-click the Cisco UCS icon appearing in the Administration section.
3.        Click the Register button and provide the following options in the Register UCS Domain dialogue box that appears:
a.        UCS Hostname/IP
b.       Username
c.        Password
d.       Port (if different than 443)
e.       Leave SSL selected and click the Visible to All users option
4.       Click OK to register the UCS Domain.
Using the Cisco UCS vCenter Plugin
The plugin can now enable the functions described at the start of this section by double-clicking the registered UCS Domain:
This will display a view of the components associated to the domain:
Selecting within the chassis or rack mounts will provide a list of ESXi or non-ESXi servers to perform operations on the following:
In addition to viewing and working within objects shown in the UCS Plug-in’s view of the UCS Domain, direct access of UCS functions provided by the plugin can be selected within the drop-down options of hosts registered to vCenter or within the Summary page of the ESXi host:
For full installation instructions and usage information, please refer to the Cisco UCS Manager Plug-in for VMware vSphere Web Client User Guide at: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/sw/vmware_tools/vCenter/vCenter_Plugin_User_Guide/2x/b_vCenter_2x.html
Pure Storage Best Practices for vSphere
The Pure Storage FlashArray has very few necessary best practice changes for VMware ESXi. There are, though, a few requirements and considerations:
·         Virtual Disk Types: Pure Storage recommends thin type virtual disks for the majority of virtual machines. Thin virtual disks are the most flexible and provide benefits such as in-guest space reclamation support. For virtual machines that demand the lowest possible latency with the most consistent performance, eagerzeroedthick virtual disks should be used. The use of zeroedthick (aka “lazy” or “sparse”) is discouraged at all times.
·         Virtual Machine SCSI adapter: Pure Storage recommends using the Paravirtual SCSI adapter in virtual machines to provide access to virtual disks/RDMs. The Paravirtual SCSI adapter provides the highest possible performance levels with the most efficient use of CPU during intense workloads. Virtual machines with small I/O requirements can use the default adapters if preferred.
·         Volume sizing and volume count: Pure Storage has no recommendations around volume sizing or volume count. The FlashArray volumes have no artificially limited queue depth, not on the volume level or the port level. A single volume can use the entire performance of the FlashArray if needed. In the case of very large volumes, or volumes serving intense workloads it might be necessary to increase internal queues inside of ESXi (HBA device queue, Disk.SchedNumReqOutstanding, virtual SCSI adapter queue).
·         VMFS-6 is the recommended datastore type to enable automatic Run Space Reclamation (UNMAP) to ensure the FlashArray capacity usage accurately reflects the actual usage inside of VMware.
