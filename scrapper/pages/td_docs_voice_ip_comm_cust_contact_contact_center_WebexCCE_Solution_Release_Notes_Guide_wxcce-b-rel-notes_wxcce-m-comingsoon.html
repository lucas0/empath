Virtual Agent-Voice for Dialogflow CX in FedRAMP-authorized Webex CCE deployments
You can sign up for Google’s Dialogflow CX using the Operations console (NOAMP) that supports the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140–2 Level 1.
Support for Microsoft Windows 11 (64 bit)
Webex CCE will soon support the Microsoft Windows 11 (64 bit) client operating system for agent, supervisor, and administrators.
Ability to host custom code applications on Webex CCE
You can host and run your custom code applications on Webex CCE. You can easily migrate current CVP applications hosted locally or on distant servers to Webex CCE without disrupting ongoing calls using VXML and Call servers. You can separate your custom code from your core VXML application, making it easier to spot VXML server crashes and other memory leak issues.
Ability to view reports in local time
You can set the time based on the time zone of the business operations. Your customers who are migrating from the on-premises deployment to Webex CCE can view the real time and historical reports in their business time zone.
Support for Enterprise Chat and Email (ECE) and Webex Connect on the same Webex CCE deployment
You can sign up for Enterprise Chat and Email (ECE) and Webex Connect on the same deployment. You can choose to use ECE for customer interactions over email and chat, and use Webex Connect for customer interactions through other digital channels.
Connect with business through more digital channels
Your customers can leverage other digital channels such as Facebook messenger and WhatsApp to connect with business.
Monitoring interface for partners and customers
You can view events and notifications using a cloud-based monitoring interface and plan maintenance schedules. You can access these events and notifications using various mediums such as Email, Webhooks, and Cisco Teams.
