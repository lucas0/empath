Product Overview
The Cisco® ATA 190 Analog Telephone Adaptor is a handset-to-Ethernet adaptor that turns traditional telephone devices into IP devices (Figures 1 and 2). Customers can take advantage of the many new and exciting IP telephony applications by connecting their analog devices to Cisco ATAs.
The Cisco ATA products are standards-based communication devices that deliver true, next-generation voice-over-IP (VoIP) terminations to businesses and residences worldwide. The Cisco ATA 190:
●   Protects existing telephone investment: The Cisco ATA 190 supports two voice ports (RJ-11 phone ports), each with its own independent telephone number, and a single RJ-45 10/100 BASE-T Ethernet port. Each port supports either voice calls or fax sessions, and both ports can be used simultaneously. This adaptor can use existing Ethernet LAN deployments.
●   Is cost-effective: The Cisco ATA 190 helps customers turn their analog phone devices into IP devices cost-effectively and is the preferred solution to address the needs of customers who connect to enterprise networks, small-office environments, or the emerging VoIP managed voice services and local services market.
Enterprise customers can use the Cisco ATA 190 to connect analog phones and fax machines to their VoIP network. Service providers are taking advantage of emerging telephony applications and the ease of deploying second-line services using the Cisco ATA solutions.

Feature
Benefits
Configuration and Provisioning
●  Configuration as per Cisco endpoints devices
●  Autoprovisioning with Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) for servers
●  Automatic assignment of IP address, network routing IP, and subnet mask using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
●  Touch-tone telephone keypad configuration with voice prompt
●  Administration password to protect configuration and access
●  Remote upgrades through network
●  Cisco Unified Communications Manager (UCM) standard configuration and provisioning options
●  Ease of administration
Voice Quality
●  Advanced preprocessing to optimize full-duplex voice compression
●  High-performance line-echo cancellation to eliminate noise and echo
●  Voice activity detection (VAD) and comfort noise generation (CNG) to save bandwidth by delivering voice, not silence; VAD is configurable, and the ATA 190 determines whether CNG should be turned on dynamically
●  Dynamic network monitoring to reduce jitter artifacts such as packet loss
Clear, natural-sounding voice quality
Signaling Protocol
●  Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) on the Cisco line side
Allows interoperation with Cisco UCM SIP solution
Security
●  Secure Real-Time Transfer Protocol (SRTP) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) over SIP
Secure media and secure signaling support, for secure solutions
Fax Support
●  T38 fax support
Standard fax capability to send faxes over the IP network; the T.38 fax relay feature enables devices to use fax machines to send files over the IP network
Form Factor
●  Fits in most environments
New form-factor design based on the Cisco endpoints portfolio
Cisco UCM Version Compatibility
The Cisco ATA 190 is compatible with Cisco UCM Versions 8.5(1), 8.6(2), 9.1(2), 10.0(1) and later.
