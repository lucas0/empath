Cisco ISE Node Terminology
A Cisco ISE node can provide various services based on the persona that it assumes. The menu options that are available through the Admin portal are dependent on the role and personas that a Cisco ISE node assumes.
Table 1. Different Types of Cisco ISE Nodes
Node Type
Description
Policy Administration node (PAN)
A Cisco ISE node with the Administration persona allows you to perform all administrative operations and configurations on Cisco ISE. It serves as a single pane of glass for viewing all administrative operations, configurations, and contextual data. It synchronizes the configuration to the rest of the nodes in the deployment.
Policy Service node (PSN)
A Cisco ISE node with the Policy Service persona provides network access, posture, guest access, client provisioning, and profiling services. This persona evaluates the policies and makes all the decisions.
Monitoring node (MnT)
A Cisco ISE node with the Monitoring persona functions as the log collector and stores log messages from all the Administration and Policy Service nodes in a network. This persona provides advanced monitoring and troubleshooting tools that you can use to effectively manage the network and resources. A node with this persona aggregates and correlates the data that it collects, and provides you with meaningful reports.
pxGrid node
You can use Cisco pxGrid to share context-sensitive information from Cisco ISE session directory with other network systems such as Cisco ISE ecosystem partner systems and other Cisco platforms. The pxGrid framework can also be used to exchange policy and configuration data between nodes (like sharing tags and policy objects between Cisco ISE and third party vendors) and for other information exchanges.
Different Types of Cisco ISE Deployment
A deployment is one or more Cisco ISE nodes connected together in a cluster (distributed system).
A deployment that has a single Cisco ISE node is called a standalone deployment. This node runs all the personas. Standalone deployment is not recommended for production because it does not provide redundancy.
A deployment that has more than one Cisco ISE node is called a distributed deployment. To support failover and to improve performance, you can set up a deployment with multiple Cisco ISE nodes in a distributed fashion. In a Cisco ISE distributed deployment, administration and monitoring activities are centralized, and processing is distributed across the Policy Service nodes. Depending on your performance needs, you can scale your deployment. The following table describes the different types of Cisco ISE deployment.
Table 2. Types of Cisco ISE Deployments

Medium Deployment
Large Deployment
All ISE personas (PAN + MnT + PSN + pxGrid) on the same appliance or VM instance.
Not recommended for production.
All ISE personas (PAN + MnT + PSN + pxGrid) on the same appliance or VM instances.
Two-node deployment. One node as primary and the other node as secondary for redundancy.
An additional node can be added (which is optional) to a small deployment as a PSN, pxGrid, or Health Check node. The additional node can be a combination of any of the following personas:
Dedicated PSN
pxGrid node
Health Check node
Note
  Adding an extra node with a PSN, pxGrid, or Health Check persona does not alter the existing scale limits of the small deployment. We recommend that you use the additional node only for load sharing purposes.
PAN + MnT + pxGrid running on the same node.
One node as primary and the other node as secondary for redundancy.
PSNs on dedicated nodes.
Nodes can be appliances or equivalent VMs.
Supports up to 6 PSNs (for Cisco ISE 3.0 and above). You can also enable pxGrid persona on any of the PSN or add dedicated pxGrid nodes (maximum up to 2) to the deployment.
Maximum 8 nodes (2 x PAN/MnT/pxGrid + 6 x PSN Or 2 x PAN/MnT + 4 x PSN + 2 x pxGrid/SXP)
PAN (2), MnT (2), pxGrid, and PSNs on dedicated nodes.
Nodes can be appliances or equivalent VMs.
Supports up to 4 pxGrid nodes.
Supports up to 50 PSNs
Maximum 58 nodes (2 x PAN + 2 x MnT + 50 x PSN + 4 x pxGrid)
Sizing Guidelines for ISE Deployment
You can choose the right ISE deployment based on the maximum scale numbers for active endpoints offered by specific deployment type, maximum scale numbers for active endpoints supported by individual PSN nodes and other relevant factors that are described in the below sections.
Every endpoint with unique MAC address is considered as one active session and the concurrent active sessions support is applicable for all types of sessions including Dot1x, Mab, Guest, BYOD, and Posture.
The maximum number of active sessions in the below table are derived based on tests under following conditions:
ISE deployments are formed in single datacenter deployed in same region, low latency (less than 5 ms) between the ISE internode communications, dot1xauthentications and accounting events generated by endpoints in the range of 2 to 4 repetitions per day, and majority of the sessions are RADIUS protocols authenticating with local ID providers.

*Cisco SNS 3795 is equipped with more RAM and better Disk Read/Write performance. It is best suited for dedicated PAN, dedicated MNT, or PAN/MNT personas and provides no added value when deployed as a dedicated PSN.

Note
SNS 3595 is supported in Cisco ISE Release 3.2 and earlier versions.
SNS 3515 is supported in Cisco ISE Release 3.0 and previous versions. The number of maximum concurrent active endpoints supported by a dedicated PSN is 7,500 and a shared PSN is 5,000.
Considerations for Choosing a Deployment
You can choose small deployment for up to 50,000 concurrent active sessions and medium deployment for up to 150,000 concurrent active sessions.
Large deployment is required for more than 150,000 concurrent concurrent active sessions. You must register MnT nodes as Dedicated MnT nodes in Large deployment.
We recommend that you deploy PSNs closer to workload and Identity Providers (such as AD, LDAP) for performance sensitive loads.
We recommend that you group PSNs for similar workload (for example, RADIUS Dot1x, Guest/BYOD, TACACS+) and distribute traffic through load balancer.
For better performance, it is recommended to configure Calling-Station-ID (MAC) based stickiness in the load balancer.
It is recommended to configure the PSNs in Node-groups if you are using the services that need URL redirect (for example, posture services, guest services, MDM, and so on).
It is recommended to have multiple datacenters and group PSNs per datacenter. You can implement RADIUS (Primary/Secondary/Tertiary) failover on NAS devices. For example, if the primary datacenter (DC-A) fails, 50 percent NADs can failover to secondary datacenter (DC-B) and remaining NADs can failover to tertiary datacenter (DC-C).
It is recommended to implement N+1 or N+2 redundancy within a PSN group.
It is highly recommended to purge guest and inactive endpoints at regular intervals to avoid latency in ISE operations.
The maximum concurrent active session values given above for each deployment are applicable for connected devices that are generating dot1x authentications up to 4 times a day.
In case of deployments where endpoints generate repeated authentication and accounting events, more number of PSNs are required in PSN group to help in handling heavy traffic scenarios like simultaneous login events from huge number of users, Wi-Fi users roaming from one location to another, and so on.
PSN node variations include TACACS+ PSN (T+PSN), TC-NAC PSN (TCNPSN), Guest PSN (GPSN), Cisco TrustSec PSN (CTSPSN), Security Group eXchange Protocol PSN (SXPSN), and PassiveID PSN (PIDPSN). For better performance, it is recommended to reserve TACACS+, RADIUS, Guest/BYOD workloads to dedicated PSN groups within a deployment.
It is recommended to assign separate Cisco TrustSec PSNs (CTSPSNs) to handle TrustSec functions for TrustSec deployments to avoid overloading of RADIUS PSNs while pushing policies.
For large scale NAC environments with huge number of Device Administration tasks (for example, heavy usage of scripts or Network management Systems), we recommend that you split the deployments and use a separate deployment for Device Administration (TACACS+).

Note
Cisco ISE Release 3.1 Patch 6 and above and Cisco ISE Release 3.2 Patch 2 and above versions support Cisco SNS 3700 series appliances.
You cannot add additional hardware resources like memory, processor, or hard disk to a Cisco SNS hardware appliance.
Mixing SAS/SATA hard drives and SAS/SATA SSDs is not supported. You must use either SAS/SATA hard drives or SAS/SATA SSDs.
SSD offers improved performance in disk read/write operations and other ISE operations like boot, installation, upgrade database intensive tasks like backup, reports generation, and so on.
Additional Power Supply can be ordered separately for SNS 3615 and SNS 3715. For component part numbers, see Cisco Secure Network Server Data Sheet.
Cisco ISE Virtual Machine and Cloud Platforms
Cisco ISE can be installed on VMware servers, KVM hypervisors, Hyper-V, and Nutanix AHV. To achieve performance and scalability comparable to Cisco ISE hardware appliances, virtual machines must be allocated system resources equivalent to the Cisco SNS 3500 or 3600 series appliances as described in table below.
It is recommended that you reserve CPU and memory resources that match the resource allocation. Failure to do so may significantly impact Cisco ISE performance and stability.
For a VM deployment, the number of cores is twice the number of cores in a physical appliance due to hyperthreading. For example, in case of a small network deployment, allocate 16 vCPU cores to meet the CPU specification of SNS 3615, which has 8 CPU cores or 16 threads.
Deploy dedicated VM resources and do not share or oversubscribe resources across multiple guest VMs.
Cisco ISE is now available from the cloud, enabling you to scale your Cisco ISE deployments quickly and easily to meet changing business needs.
Cisco ISE is available as an Infrastructure as Code solution, helping you to rapidly deploy network accesses and control services anywhere.
Extend the Cisco ISE policies in your home network to new remote deployments securely through Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure Cloud Services, or Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). AWS supports Cisco ISE Release 3.1 and later releases.
OCI and Azure Cloud support is available from Cisco ISE Release 3.2 and later releases.
See Deploy Cisco ISE Natively on Cloud Platforms and respective cloud documentations for resource specifications of supported instances.
Table below describes matrix of VM specification, cloud instances to their equivalent Cisco SNS appliances.
