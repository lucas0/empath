Defect ID Headline
CSCvx00521 QuoVadis root CA decommission impacting Smart Licensing and Smart Call Home Functionality
Problem Description
For affected IOS XE versions of Cisco Catalyst (IE3x00) Rugged Series Switches, Cisco Catalyst (IE34xx ) Heavy Duty Series Switches, Cisco Embedded Services (ESS3x00) Series and Cisco Embedded Services (ESS9300) Switches, some Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates issued from the QuoVadis root certificate authority (CA) trust chain before March 31, 2021 cannot be renewed from this CA. Once those certificates (issued by QuoVadis) expire on devices or are removed from the Cisco cloud servers, functions such as Smart Licensing and Smart Call Home will fail to establish secure connections to Cisco and might not operate properly.
Background
The QuoVadis Root CA 2 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) used by Cisco IOS® XE software to issue SSL certificates is subject to an industry-wide issue that affects revocation abilities. Due to this issue, no new QuoVadis Root CA 2 certificates will be issued or renewed by Cisco after March 31, 2021. This affects certificate renewals on devices, Cisco cloud servers, and third-party services.
Certificates issued before the QuoVadis Root CA 2 was decommissioned will continue to be valid. However, the certificates will not renew when they expire on either the device or the Cisco cloud server. This will cause functions such as Smart Licensing and Smart Call Home to fail to establish secure connections to Cisco cloud servers.
This table shows a summary of the QuoVadis Root CA 2 certificate expiration dates for affected Cisco services.

Smart Licensing
Problem Symptom
Expiration of the QuoVadis Root CA 2 certificates affects these services with the associated symptoms.
Affected Services Symptoms for Affected Services
Smart Licensing Failure to connect to the server (Details are provided in this section)
Smart Call Home Failure to connect to the server and the Call-Home HTTP request fails
  For Cisco IOS XE based devices, affected devices will be unable to connect to the Smart Licensing and Smart Call Home services hosted by Cisco. Smart licenses might fail entitlement and reflect an Out of Compliance status.
The features that use Smart Licensing will continue to function for one year after the last successful secure connection. Some Smart Licensing symptoms are:
The device might indicate a failure to communicate with the Smart Licensing server within 30 days from the last successful connection.
The device will show the "Authorization Expired" state if there is no communication with the Smart Licensing server within 90 days.
The device will show the "Unregistered" state if there is no communication with the Smart Licensing server after one year and the licensed features usage become suspended.
Note: Offline licensing, such as Permanent License Reservation (PLR) and Specific License Reservation (SLR), is not affected by the certificate change on the Smart Licensing server.
For additional information, refer to the Cisco Smart Licensing Guide, Smart Licensing using Policy on Catalyst Switching Platforms, and Release Notes for Cisco Catalyst IE3x00 Rugged, IE3400 Heavy Duty, ESS3300, and ESS9300 Series Switches.
Troubleshooting Tech Notes
Cisco Smart Licensing - Troubleshooting Steps and Considerations on Catalyst Platforms
If there is an error in communication with the server due to trust or other reasons, these error messages might be observed:
%CALL_HOME-5-SL_MESSAGE_FAILED: Fail to send out Smart Licensing message to:https://<;ip>/its/service/oddce/services/DDCEService (ERR 205 : Request Aborted)

%SMART_LIC-3-COMM_FAILED:Communications failure with the Cisco Smart Software Manager or satellite: Fail to send out Call Home HTTP message.

%SMART_LIC-3-COMM_FAILED: Communications failure with the Cisco Smart Software Manager (CSSM) : No detailed information given
Workaround/Solution
Cisco has migrated from the QuoVadis Root CA 2 to the IdenTrust Commercial Root CA 1 for SSL certificates. Cisco recommends these two options to add the new IdenTrust Commercial Root CA 1 certificate to the affected devices.
Software Upgrade
Manual Certificate Update
Software Upgrade
For Cisco IOS XE based products, upgrade the software to the fixed Release 17.6.1 or later in order to resolve the root CA certificate issue for affected platforms.
Manual Certificate Update
In order to resolve the issue without a software upgrade, either of these two workarounds can be implemented.
Workaround 1
Enter this CLI command in order to manually import the IdenTrust Commercial Root CA 1 into the product truststore:
Device(config)# crypto pki trustpool import url http://www.cisco.com/security/pki/trs/ios_core.p7b 
Or if it is already copied to the device flash, enter this command:
Device(config)# crypto pki trustpool import url flash:ios_core.p7b
Workaround 2
Enter the CLI commands in the procedure in order to manually import the IdenTrust Commercial Root CA 1 into the product truststore.
The updated IdenTrust Root CA 1 is shown here and complies with sha1WithRSAEncryption signature algorithm requirements.
