Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCwa67488 Modify remote updates to use expanded root certificate bundle
Problem Description
For affected versions of Firepower software, automatic software downloads, Snort Rule Updates (SRUs), Vulnerability Database (VDB) updates, and Geolocation Database (GeoDB) updates might fail after January 10, 2023 due to a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate change.
Background
The existing SSL certificate authority (CA) used to sign certificates for Secure Firewall software updates will be decommissioned and replaced on January 10, 2023.
The Sourcefire Customer Center has been signed by this CA and is used to obtain Secure Firewall software and content updates.
Problem Symptom
Affected Secure Firewall devices will be unable to automatically receive the latest Secure Firewall software, SRU, VDB, and GeoDB updates from the Sourcefire Customer Center.
The Secure Firewall device might experience a degraded security posture for future threats. Health monitoring indications regarding failures to download software and receive content updates should be ignored until the device software is upgraded to a fixed release.
Workaround/Solution
Workaround
There are two workaround options.
Option 1. Manually download the Secure Firewall software and content updates from Cisco Software Central and upload to the Secure Firewall device using the Firepower Management Center (FMC) or Firepower Device Manager (FDM).
Option 2. For Firepower appliances running software versions 6.2.3.17, 6.4.0.13, 6.6.5, or 7.0.0 or later, enter these commands to point the Firepower software and content update downloads to the new SSL certificate authority.
Do not use this workaround when you use Common Criteria (CC) Mode or when devices are managed by the FDM. Instead, upgrade to one of the Firepower software versions provided in the Solution section.
Enter sudo su in order to elevate to root.
Enter mv /etc/sf/keys/fireamp/thawte_roots /etc/sf/keys/fireamp/thawte_roots_bk in order to back up the current CA root bundle used for downloads.
Enter ln -s /etc/ssl/certs/ /etc/sf/keys/fireamp/thawte_roots to cause the updated CA root bundle to be used for subsequent downloads.
Use this command to verify that the Firepower software points to the new SSL certificate authority.
Enter sudo su in order to elevate to root.
Enter ls -l /etc/sf/keys/fireamp/thawte_roots to display the curent CA root bundle used for downloads.
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root <Date & Timestamp> /etc/sf/keys/fireamp/thawte_roots -> /etc/ssl/certs/
If the output contains "/etc/ssl/certs/" then the Firepower software points to the new SSL certificate authority.
Solution
Cisco recommends to upgrade to one of the Firepower software versions shown in the table in order to continue to receive the latest Secure Firewall software, SRU, VDB, and GeoDB updates.
The FMC software must be updated to fix the certificate issue. The Secure Firewall device managed by the FMC does NOT need to be updated to fix the certificate issue.
The FDM must be updated to fix the certificate issue for the Secure Firewall device managed by the FDM.
