    With powerful data center−class servers that are virtualization-ready, you can host business applications and network services right in your branch-office router.
Product overview
Cisco UCS® E-Series Servers bring data center-class blade servers to the branch office. These powerful, small form-factor, x86 64-bit blade servers reside in Cisco® branch-office routers: the Cisco 4000 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISRs) networking platforms. The blades are virtualization-ready and host essential infrastructure services and mission-critical business applications, all while you maintain a lean branch-office environment (Figure 1).

Product details
Cisco UCS E-Series Servers
The Cisco Unified Computing System™ (Cisco UCS) E-series M3 Server is available in two flavors: as singlewide and as doublewide module. The singlewide version occupies a single service-module slot in the Cisco 4000 Series ISR as shown above. The doublewide module occupies two service-module slots side-by-side.
All Cisco UCS E-Series M3 Servers are high-density blade servers with single-socket Intel Xeon-D processors. They balance simplicity, performance, and application density while operating in an energy-efficient environment providing better energy efficiency than preceding models. The servers also include integrated remote lights-out management.
They thus provide an excellent platform for introducing virtualization into the branch office and supporting
mission-critical business applications. The innovative, zero-footprint form factor of the Cisco UCS E-Series Servers in conjunction with the lower total cost of ownership (TCO) of the Intel Xeon processor increases business agility and enhances reliability when compared to standalone rack-mount and tower servers.
Table 1 lists the top-level part numbers for the E-Series Servers.

Cisco UCS E-Series Double-Wide Servers:
●  UCS-E180D-M3/K9
●  UCS-E1120D-M3/K9
Applications for Cisco UCS E-Series Servers
Cisco UCS E-Series Servers provide excellent performance and value for these and other types of workloads:
●     Cisco Network services: Cisco Virtual Wide Area Application Services (vWAAS), Cisco Virtual Wireless LAN Controller (vWLC), Cisco Unity® Connection, Cisco Firepower Threat Defense for ISR and other Cisco applications
●     Mission-critical business applications: Point-Of-Sale (POS) systems, bank teller In-Office Control Points (IOCPs), Electronic-Medical-Record (EMR) systems, inventory management systems, video surveillance systems and cloud connectors
●     Core Network services: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server services and Domain Name System (DNS) server services
●     Core Microsoft Windows services: Microsoft Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), Microsoft Windows print services and Microsoft Windows file services
●     Client-management services: Configuration and operations management, monitoring services, update and patching services, backup and recovery services and terminal server gateways
Features and benefits
The Cisco UCS E-Series Servers easily extend the Cisco UCS data center portfolio to branch-office environments. By adding virtualization to the servers, you can deploy new services incrementally on a schedule that best meets your timing and budget. Meanwhile, you avoid service-call costs for onsite visits to deploy new hardware or software.
Cisco UCS E-Series Servers address your changing business needs in the following ways:
●     Reduced operational burden: Through a consolidated, wire-free infrastructure, Cisco UCS E-Series Servers make the addition of new services and infrastructure quick and easy.
●     Simplified system maintenance: Cisco UCS E-Series Servers ease physical server provisioning and system maintenance.
●     Enhanced server management: Built-in lights-out server management through the Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) which runs on the same dedicated baseboard management controller hardware found in all Cisco UCS products. This feature provides standalone management consistency with Cisco UCS C-Series Rack Servers for both local and remote server monitoring and configuration management.
●     Stronger physical security: The blades require no external network cables or physical keyboard, video or mouse (KVM). They can therefore be easily secured in a wiring closet or other secure location without compromising manageability, a situation that is difficult to achieve with traditional legacy tower and rack-mount servers which lack virtual KVM capabilities.
●     Small footprint: Cisco UCS E-Series Servers include multicore x86 64-bit Intel Xeon processors. You can reduce your branch-office server footprint by incorporating high-performance, power-optimized blade servers directly into Cisco 4000 Series ISRs in the branch office. These servers are integrated and housed in a single Cisco ISR chassis, delivering an excellent all-in-one platform for the lean branch office.
