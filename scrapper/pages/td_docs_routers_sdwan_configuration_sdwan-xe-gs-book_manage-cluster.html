Cisco vManage Persona-based Cluster Configuration
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a
Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.6.1
Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1
Simplifies adding Cisco vManage servers to a cluster by identifying servers based on personas. A persona defines what services run on a server.
A Cisco vManage cluster consists of at least three Cisco vManage servers. These servers manage the Cisco SD-WAN edge devices in a network. Cisco vManage servers in a cluster perform specific functions based on the services that are running on them. In this way, a cluster distributes the workload among Cisco vManage servers while sharing information between these servers. For scaling recommendations, see Server Recommendations for your release in Cisco SD-WAN Controller Compatibility Matrix and Server Recommendations.
Use the Administration > Cluster Management window to create a Cisco vManage cluster and perform related tasks.
From Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, each Cisco vManage server has a persona. The persona is determined when the Cisco vManageserver first boots up after Cisco vManage is installed and defines which services run on the server. The persona of a server lasts for the lifetime of the server and cannot be changed. A server must have a persona before it can be added to a cluster. For more information on personas, see Cisco vManage Persona and Storage Device.
The role that a server has in a cluster depends on its persona. A Cisco vManage server can have any of the following personas:
Compute+Data: Includes all services that are required for Cisco vManage, including services that are used for the application, statistics, configuration, messaging, and coordination
Compute: Includes services that are used for the application, configuration, messaging, and coordination
Data: Includes services that are used for the application and statistics

Guidelines for a Cisco vManage Cluster
The following guidelines apply to a Cisco vManage cluster:
We recommend that all members of a Cisco vManage cluster be located in the same data center.
We recommend that the IP addresses of all members of the Cisco vManage cluster be in the same subnet.
We recommend that Cisco vManage cluster interface should not be the same as transport interface. Beginning with Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1, this is enforced. If you attempt to configure this, Cisco vManage displays an error message.
The cluster interface should not be accessible externally.
Access to Cisco vManage cluster IP addresses is restricted to Cisco vManage instances in the same cluster.
The members of a Cisco vManage cluster rely on timestamps to synchronize data and to track device uptime. For this time-dependent data to remain accurate, if you need to change the clock time of a Cisco vManage server in a cluster, make the same change on every Cisco vManage server in the cluster.
In a three node cluster deployment, only one node can have a systematic failure. When one node fails, the Cisco vManage Graphical User Interface (GUI) of two remaining nodes are reachable and can communicate with remaining nodes through SSH. If two nodes fail, the GUI goes down for all the devices.
When logged in using a single sign-on (SSO) user with netadmin privilege, user cannot perform any of the cluster or disaster recovery operations using the SSO user. For any cluster operations like add, delete node, or enable SD-AVC, Cisco vManage expects any local username and password part of net-admin group. In case of multitenancy, only admin user can update the SD-AVC. Other users even with netadmin privileges cannot update SD-AVC.
View Available Cluster Services
To view the services that are available in and reachable on all the members in a Cisco vManage cluster, choose Administration > Cluster Management > Service Reachability.
Configure the Cluster IP Address of a Cisco vManage Server
When you start Cisco vManage for the first time, the default IP address of the Cisco vManage server is shown as localhost. Before you can add a new Cisco vManage server to a cluster, you must change the localhost address of the primary Cisco vManage server to an out-of-band IP address. (From Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, the primary Cisco vManage server has the Compute+Data persona.) Servers in the cluster use this out-of-band IP address to communicate with each other.
If you need to change the out-of-band IP address in the future, contact your Cisco support representative.
Cluster interconnection between Cisco vManage servers requires that each of the servers be assigned a static IP address. We recommend that you do not use DHCP to assign IP addresses to Cisco vManage servers that are to be a part of a cluster. Configure the IP address on a nontunnel interface in VPN 0.
Before you configure the cluster IP address of a Cisco vManage server, ensure that out-of-band IP addresses have been configured on VPN0 for its server interfaces. This configuration typically is done when the server is provisioned. The port type for an out-of-band IP address must be service for the IP address to be available for assigning to a Cisco vManage server.

Note
From Cisco vManage Release 20.11.1, some alarms display the hostname as localhost during the cluster setup for the first time as the system-ip/hostname is not configured in Cisco vManage. When the system-ip/hostname is configured, the alarms display the correct hostname.
Configure the IP Address for Releases Before Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1
Configure the IP address of a Cisco vManage server before you add the server to the cluster. To do so for releases before Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, follow these steps:
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Administration > Cluster Management and click Service Configuration.
Click Add vManage.
The Edit vManage dialog box opens.
From the vManage IP Address drop-down list, choose an IP address to assign to the Cisco vManage server.
Enter the user name and password for logging in to the Cisco vManage server.
Click Update.
The Cisco vManage server reboots and displays the Cluster Management window.
Configure the IP Address for Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1 and Later Releases
Configure the IP address of a Cisco vManage server before you add the server to the cluster. To do so from Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, perform the following steps.
Perform this procedure on the primary Cisco vManage server (which has the Compute+Data persona).
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Administration > Cluster Management.
The Cluster Management window is displayed. The table on this window lists the Cisco vManage servers that are in the cluster.
Click ... adjacent to the Cisco vManage server to configure and click Edit.
The Edit vManage dialog box is displayed.
In the Edit vManage dialog box, perform the following actions.

Note
You cannot change the persona of a server. So the Node Persona options are disabled.
From the vManage IP Address drop-down list, choose an out-of-band static IP address to assign to the server.
In the Username field, enter the user name for logging in to the server.
In the Password field, enter the password for logging in to the server.
(Optional) Click Enable SD-AVC if you want Cisco Software-Defined Application Visibility and Control (SD-AVC) to run on the server.
Cisco SD-AVC is a component of Cisco Application Visibility and Control (AVC). It can be enabled on only one Cisco vManage server. The server on which it is enabled must have the Compute+Data or the Compute persona. Cisco SD-AVC cannot be enabled on a server that has the Data persona.

Note
If Cisco vManage is set up as a cluster and the cluster crashes as a result of a reboot or upgrade, the connection to the edge device is reset and the custom app ceases to function.
To resolve this and to resume operation, redefine the custom application name with a new, unique name. For more information to define custom applications, see the Define Custom Applications Using Cisco vManage chapter of the Cisco SD-WAN Policies Configuration Guide.
Click Update.
The server reboots and displays the Cluster Management window.

Cisco vManage Persona-based Cluster Configuration
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a
Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.6.1
Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1
Simplifies adding Cisco vManage servers to a cluster by identifying servers based on personas. A persona defines what services run on a server.
The following sections provide information about adding a Cisco vManage server to a cluster in various Cisco vManage releases.
Add a Cisco vManage Server to a Cluster for Releases Before Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1
To add a new Cisco vManage server to a cluster for releases before Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, perform the following steps on the primary Cisco vManage server.
Before you begin, ensure that the default IP address of the Cisco vManage server has been changed to an out-of-band IP address as described in Configure the Cluster IP Address of a Cisco vManage Server.
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Administration > Cluster Management and click Service Configuration.
Click Add vManage.
The Edit vManage window opens.
In the vManage IP Address field, select an IP address to assign to the Cisco vManage server.
Enter the username and password for logging in to the Cisco vManage server.
Enter the IP address of the Cisco vManage server that you are adding to the cluster.
Specify the username and password for the new Cisco vManage server.
Select the services to be run on the Cisco vManage server. You can select from the services listed below. Note that the Application Server field is not editable. The Cisco vManage Application Server is the local Cisco vManage HTTP web server.
Statistics Database: Stores statistics from all the Cisco SD-WAN devices in the network.
Configuration Database: Stores all the device and feature templates and configurations for all the Cisco SD-WAN devices in the network.
Messaging Server: Distributes messages and shares state among all the Cisco vManage cluster members.
Click Add.
The Cisco vManage server that you just added reboots before joining the cluster.

Note
In a cluster, we recommend that you run at least three instances of each service.
When you add the first two compute or compute+data nodes to the cluster, the host node’s application-server is unavailable. The following message is displayed on the host node’s GUI, before the application-server shuts down in the host node: \Node added to the cluster. The operation may take up to 30 minutes and may cause application-server to restart in between. Once the application server is back online, the post cluster operation progress can be viewed under tasks pop-up\.
Add a Cisco vManage Server to a Cluster for Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1 and Later Releases
From Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, a cluster supports any of the following deployments of nodes:
Three Compute+Data nodes
Three Compute+Data nodes and three Data nodes

Note
DATA nodes should be added only after 3 node cluster with CONFIG+DATA is added.
Three Compute nodes and three Data nodes (supported only in an upgrade from an existing deployment)
If you require a different combination of nodes, contact your Cisco representative.
To add a Cisco vManage server to a cluster from Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, perform the following steps.
Perform this procedure on a Compute+Data node or a Compute node. Performing this procedure on a Data node is not supported because a Data node does not run all the services that are required for the addition.
Do not add a server that was a member of the cluster and then removed from the cluster. If you need to add that server to the cluster, bring up a new VM on that server to be used as the node to add.
Before you begin, ensure that the default IP address of the Cisco vManage server has been changed to an out-of-band IP address, as described in Configure the Cluster IP Address of a Cisco vManage Server.
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Administration > Cluster Management.
The Cluster Management page window appears. The table on this window shows the Cisco vManage servers that are in the cluster.
Click Add vManage.
The Add vManage dialog box opens.

Note
If the Edit vManage dialog box opens, configure an out-of-band IP address for the server, as described in Configure the Cluster IP Address of a Cisco vManage Server, and then repeat this procedure for adding a server.
In the Add vManage dialog box, perform the following actions:
Click the Node Persona option (Compute+Data, Compute, or Data) that corresponds to the persona that has been configured for the server.
You can determine the persona of a server by logging in to the server and looking at the persona display on the Administration > Cluster Management window. If you choose an incorrect persona, a message displays the persona that you should choose.
From the vManage IP Address drop-down list, choose the IP address of the server to be added to the cluster.
In the Username field, enter the user name for logging in to the server.
In the Password field, enter the password for logging in to the server.
(Optional) Click Enable SD-AVC if you want Cisco Software-Defined Application Visibility and Control (SD-AVC) to run on the server.
Cisco SD-AVC is a component of Cisco Application Visibility and Control (AVC). It can be enabled on one Cisco vManage server. The server on which it is enabled must have the Compute+Data or the Compute persona. Cisco SD-AVC cannot be enabled on a server that has the Data persona.
If you enabled Cisco SD-AVC for this server when you changed its IP address, the Enable SD-AVC check box is checked by default.
Click Add.
To confirm, click OK.
The dialog box indicates that the services will restart, and that the existing metadata and other information that is not required when the server joins the cluster will be deleted from the server.
When you click OK, the system starts the server add operation. The Cluster Management window displays the tasks that the system performs as it adds the server.
As part of this operation, the system checks the compatibility of the server that you are adding. This check ensures that the server has sufficient disk space, and that the persona that you specified matches the persona of the node.
After the server is added, the system performs a cluster sync operation, which rebalances the services in the cluster. Then the Cisco vManage servers in the cluster restart.
Configure Statistics Database to Monitor Cisco vManage
The following sections explain how to view available and used disk space for the statistics database and how to configure storage allocation in this database.
View Statistics Database Space Usage
To view the amount of space available for and utilized by the statistics database on the local Cisco vManage server, choose Administration > Settings > Statistics Database Configuration and click View. The top of the window shows the maximum space available for the database and the total amount of space currently being utilized. The table shows the disk space currently being utilized for each statistics type.
For information about disk size recommendations and requirements, see Server Recommendations for your release in Cisco SD-WAN Controller Compatibility Matrix and Server Recommendations.
Configure Statistics Database
To configure the statistics database that stores all the real-time statistics from the local Cisco SD-WAN Controller Compatibility Matrix and Server Recommendations:
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Administration > Settings.
In the Statistics Database Configuration section, click Edit to view the maximum space available for the database.
For each field in the Statistics Type column, assign the amount of storage to be allocated, in gigabytes (GB). The total value of all the fields cannot exceed the maximum available space.
Click Save.
Cisco vManage updates the storage allocations that you have assigned once a day, at midnight.
View Cisco vManage Service Details
The following sections describe how to view detailed information about services that are running on a Cisco vManage server and how to view devices that are connected to Cisco vManage.
View Detailed Information about Services
To view detailed information about the services running on a Cisco vManage server:
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Administration > Cluster Management and click Service Configuration.
Click the hostname of the Cisco vManage server.
The vManage Details window opens, displaying the process IDs of all the Cisco vManage services that are enabled on Cisco vManage.
Click Cluster Management in the breadcrumb in the title bar to return to the Cluster Management window.
View Devices Connected to Cisco vManage
To view the list of devices connected to Cisco vManage:
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Administration > Cluster Management and click Service Configuration.
Click the hostname of the Cisco vManage server.
Click Managed Devices.
Alternatively:
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Administration > Cluster Management and click Service Configuration.
Click ... adjacent to the Cisco vManage server and choose Device Connected.
If a device is connected to Cisco vManage from a cluster, ensure that you do not configure the data stream hostname to the Cisco vManage system IP address. However, you can configure the management IP address on VPN 512 or the internet public IP address on VPN 0. For information about data stream troubleshooting tools, see Data Stream Troubleshooting Tools FAQ.
Edit Cisco vManage Parameters
You can edit various parameters for a Cisco vManage server that has been added to a cluster. To do so, follow these steps:
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Administration > Cluster Management and click Service Configuration.
Click ... adjacent to the Cisco vManage server to edit, and click Edit.
The Edit vManage window opens.
Select an IP address to edit.
Enter the username and password, and edit parameters for the selected Cisco vManage server.
For releases before Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, you can edit the cluster services.
From Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, you can change the IP address to another IP address that appears in the vManage IP Address drop-down list, change the Cisco SD-AVC setting, or change the username and password if the server credentials have changed.
Click Update.
Update Configuration Database Login
The default username of the configuration database is neo4j and the default password is password. To update the default login credentials of the configuration database, access Cisco vManage using a terminal and run the following commands. Do not use the SSH terminal option in Cisco vManage to run these commands. Doing so causes you to lose access to Cisco vManage.
Use request nms application-server stop to stop application servers on all the Cisco vManage servers whether configuration-db is enabled or not.
.
Use one of the following commands to reset the user name and password for the configuration database on all the Cisco vManage servers:
For Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.1.1 and earlier:
request nms configuration-db update-admin-user username username password password newusername newadminuser newpassword newpassword
For releases from Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.1.2:
request nms configuration-db update-admin-user
When prompted, enter your current username and password, and your new username and password.
When you run one of these commands, Cisco vManage restarts the application server

Note
If you do not know the default credentials of the configuration database, contact your Cisco support representative to retrieve the credentials.
You cannot use a previous username.
Passwords can include only a mix of characters A to Z ( upper or lowercase), digits 0 to 9, and special characters @, #, and *.
Example
For Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.1.1 and earlier:
request nms configuration-db update-admin-user username neo4j password ******** newusername myusername newpassword mypassword
For releases from Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.1.2:
request nms configuration-db update-admin-user
Enter current user name: neo4j
Enter current user password: password
Enter new user name: myusername
Enter new user password: mypassword

Note
After a configuration database admin user update, if you are unable to view a specific Cisco vManage instance, use the request nms application-server restart command to restart the application server on that Cisco vManage instance again.

Note
Starting from Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.6.1, when using the request nms configuration-db update-admin-user command to update the admin user credentials, provide the same inputs (old username, password and the new username, password) across all the nodes in the Cisco vManage cluster. You must execute the request nms configuration-db update-admin-user command one node at a time. We recommend that you do not push the CLI to all the nodes at the same time because the NMS services will restart for the new configuration to take effect.
Downgrade Cisco vManage
You cannot downgrade Cisco vManage (install a version of Cisco vManage that is lower than the current version), either through Cisco vManage or by using CLI commands.

Note
This restriction applies for single Cisco vManage instances and for Cisco vManage clusters. This restriction is not related to software upgrades or downgrades on network devices.
To downgrade your Cisco vManage version, contact your Cisco support representative.

Description
Cisco vManage Cluster Upgrade
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.1a
Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.3.1
Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1
This feature outlines the upgrade procedure for Cisco vManage servers in a cluster to Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1.
This section describes how to upgrade Cisco vManage in a cluster.
You can upgrade directly from Cisco vManage 20.3.1 or later releases to Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1. To upgrade from earlier releases, first upgrade to Cisco vManage 20.4.2 or Cisco vManage Release 20.5.1.
If you are upgrading a Cisco vManage cluster deployment from Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1 or later to Cisco vManage Release 20.5.1 or later, you must do it through the CLI.
Before You Begin
Before you upgrade Cisco vManage nodes to Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1 or later releases, verify the following:
Ensure that the internal user account vmanage-admin is not locked for any server that you are upgrading.
You can check the status of this admin account by pushing a template to the devices that are connected to the server. The push fails if the account is locked. In such a scenario, you can unlock the account by using the request aaa unlock-user vmanage-admin command.
Ensure that PKI keys have been exchanged between the servers that you are upgrading.
To do so, ensure that the control connections are in the UP state on the servers and restart the application server.
Ensure that the out-of-band IP address of each server is reachable.
Ensure that the Cisco vManage UI is accessible on all servers in the cluster.
Ensure that DCA is running on all nodes in the cluster.
To do so, use the request nms data-collection-agent status command and ensure that the status value shows running for each node.
To start DCA, if needed, use the request nms data-collection-agent start command.

Note
If these prerequisites are not met or if another error occurs during the upgrade, the activation of the image fails and a file named upgrade-context.json is created in the /opt/data/extra-packages/image-version folder on each node in the cluster. You can provide this file to your Cisco representative for assistance with resolving the issue.
If you are upgrading to Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1 or later releases from a six-node Cisco vManage cluster deployment in which not all services are running on all nodes, contact your Cisco support representative before performing the upgrade.
Take snapshots of all the vManage servers. Take a backup of the configuration database and save it in a location outside of the Cisco vManage server using the following command:
request nms configuration-db backup path path_and_filename
Ensure that Cisco vManage Release 18.3 or later is installed.
For upgrades from Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1 or later, copy the current image to each Cisco vManage server in the cluster and install the image on each Cisco vManage server by using the following command. Do not activate the image at this time.
request software install path
For upgrades from Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1 or later, activate the current image on each Cisco vManage server using the following command. All servers reboot simultaneously.
request software activate version
You must upgrade the configuration database when upgrading from one of the following:
Cisco vManage Release 18.4.x or 19.2.x to Cisco vManage 20.3.x or 20.4.x
Cisco vManage Release 20.3.x or 20.4.x to Cisco vManage Release 20.5.x or 20.6.x
Any Cisco vManage release to Cisco vManage Release 20.10.1 or later

Note
Starting from Cisco vManage Release 20.1.1, before upgrading the configuration database, ensure that you verify the database size. We recommend that the database size is less than or equal to 5 GB. To verify the database size, use the following diagnostic command:
request nms configuration-db diagnostics
When you upgrade the configuration database, ensure that you have activated the current image on each Cisco vManage server in the cluster as described in the previous step. In addition, ensure that all services except the application server and configuration-db services are running on these servers by entering the request nms all status command on each server.
To upgrade the configuration database, do the following:
To determine which node to upgrade, enter the request nms configuration-db status command on each node. In the output look for the following:
Enabled: true
Status: not running

Note
After activating a new image on a Cisco vManage host server, the server reboots. After the reboot, for approximately 30 minutes, the output of the request nms configuration-db status command shows Enabled: false even on a node that has the configuration database enabled, while NMS services are being migrated to a containerized form.
On the node to upgrade, as determined in the previous step, enter the following:
request nms configuration-db upgrade

Note
Enter this command on one node only.
Do not enter this command if you are upgrading from Cisco vManage Release 20.5.x to Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1 or later.
Enter your login credentials, if prompted. Login credentials are prompted in releases earlier than Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1 if all the Cisco vManage servers establish control connection with each other. After a successful upgrade, all the configuration database services are UP across the cluster, and the application server is started.
You can check the database upgrade logs at the following location: vmanage-server:/var/log/nms/neo4j-upgrade.log.
For information about how to upgrade Cisco vManage clusters by using the Cisco vManage GUI, see the Upgrade the Software Image on a Device section in Cisco SD-WAN Monitor and Maintain Configuration Guide.
Manually Restart vManage Processes
When the cluster is in a bad state as part of the upgrade to releases earlier than Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, you should manually restart the NMS processes. Restart the processes one at a time in an orderly manner instead of using request nms all restart or a similar command. The following manual restart order might vary for your cluster, depending on what services you are running on the Cisco vManage devices in the cluster. The following order is based on a basic cluster with three Cisco vManage devices.
On each Cisco vManage device, stop all the NMS services:
request nms all stop
Verify that all the services have stopped. It is normal for the request nms all stop command to display a message about failing to stop a service if it takes too long. So use the following command to verify that everything is stopped before proceeding further:
request nms all status
Start the Statistics database on each device that is configured to run it. Wait for the service to start each time before proceeding to the next Cisco vManage device.
request nms statistics-db start
Verify that the service is started before proceeding to start it on the next vManage. After the service starts, perform step 3 to start the Statistics database on the next Cisco vManage device. After all the Cisco vManage devices have the Statistics database running, proceed to the next step.
request nms statistics-db status
Start the Configuration database on each device that is configured to run it. Wait for the service to start each time before proceeding to the next Cisco vManage device.
request nms configuration-db start
For releases earlier than Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1, verify that the service has started before proceeding to start it on the next Cisco vManage device. Go to vshell and tail a log file to look for a message that the database is online. After confirming, go to step 5 to start the Configuration database on the next Cisco vManage device. After all the Cisco vManage devices have the Configuration database running, proceed to the next step.
tail -f -n 100 /var/log/nms/vmanage-neo4j-out.log
Start the Coordination server on each device. Wait for the service to start each time before proceeding to the next Cisco vManage device.
request nms coordination-server start
Verify that the service is started before proceeding to start it on the next vManage device. After verifying, go to step 7 to start the Coordination server on the next Cisco vManage device. After the Coordination server runs on all the Cisco vManage devices, proceed to the next step.
request nms coordination-server status
Start the Messaging server on each device. Wait for the service to start each time before proceeding to the next Cisco vManage device.
request nms messaging-server start
Verify that the service has started before proceeding to start the service on the next Cisco vManage device. After verifying, go to step 9 to start the Messaging server on the next Cisco vManage device. After the Messaging server runs on all the Cisco vManage devices, proceed to the next step.
request nms messaging-server status
Start the Application server on each device. Wait for the service to start each time before proceeding to the next Cisco vManage device.
request nms application-server start
For Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1 and later releases, start the server-proxy service on each Cisco vManage device:
request nms server-proxy start
To verify that the service is fully started, open the GUI of that Cisco vManage device. After the GUI is fully loaded and you are able to log in, start the server-proxy service on the next Cisco vManage device.
Restart the NMS cloud services on each device. Wait for the services to start each time before proceeding to the next Cisco vManage device.
You can verify that the cloud services are running by entering the following commands:
request nms cloud-agent status
request nms cloud-agent-v2 status
Verify that the service has started before proceeding to start it on the next Cisco vManage device. After verifying, start the cloud services on the next Cisco vManage device. After the cloud services run on all the Cisco vManage devices, continue to the next step.
To verify that there are no errors and everything has loaded cleanly, tail the log files.
If you experience issues when upgrading to Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1 or later, contact your Cisco support representative for assistance.

Note
Consider bringing up the services manually as described in this section whenever you have to reboot a Cisco vManage device, or after an upgrade.
Starting from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10.1a, a device-data-collector service container is added. The following is a sample output for the command, request nms device-data-collector.
Device# request nms device-data-collector
Possible completions:
  diagnostics   Run diagnostics on NMS component
  jcmd          Run jcmd on NMS component
  restart       Restart NMS component
  start         Start NMS component
  status        Status of NMS component
  stop          Stop NMS component
Remove Cisco vManage Nodes from a Cluster
You can remove a Cisco vManage node from a cluster, if necessary.
In releases earlier than Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, you can only remove n - 2 Cisco vManage nodes from a cluster of n nodes. You must retain at least two Cisco vManage nodes in a cluster.
From Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, you must retain at least two Cisco vManage nodes that include the compute capability and at least one node that includes the data capability. That is, the cluster must retain any of the following:
At least two Cisco vManage nodes that include the Compute+Data persona
At least one Cisco vManage nodes that includes the Compute+Data persona and one Cisco vManage node that includes the Compute persona
At least two Cisco vManage nodes that include the Compute persona and one Cisco vManage node that includes the Data persona
From Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, if a Cisco vManage node is reachable when you remove it from a cluster, Cisco vManage automatically performs a factory reset operation on the removed node to ensure that the node does not join the cluster again. If a Cisco vManage node is unreachable when you remove it from a cluster, a factory reset operation is not performed on the node. In this situation, the node is added back to the cluster automatically when the node becomes reachable. To prevent the node from being added back to the cluster, enter the command request software reset from the CLI of the node after the node is removed from the cluster.
To remove a Cisco vManage node from a cluster, follow these steps:
From the Cisco vManage, choose Administration > Cluster Management and click Service Configuration.
Click … adjacent to the Cisco vManage instance that you want to remove and click Remove.
The Remove vManage dialog box opens.
Enter the username and password to confirm the removal of the device from the network.
Click Remove.
The Cisco vManage instance is removed from the cluster, the certificates for that Cisco vManage are deleted, and Cisco vManage undergoes a factory reset.
