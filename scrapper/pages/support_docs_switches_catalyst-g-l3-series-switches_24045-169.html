Introduction
This document discusses and provides a sample configuration of Fast EtherChannel (FEC) and 802.1Q trunking, between a Catalyst 2948G-L3 switch that runs Cisco IOS® software and switches that run CatalystOS (all models, including Catalyst 4000, 5000, and 6000 series switches).
Prerequisites
Requirements
For a list of Catalyst switches that support 802.1Q and ISL trunking encapsulations, refer to System Requirements to Implement Trunking.
There are certain guidelines for the configuration of EtherChannel and trunking. Refer to the documentation for your switch software. For example, if you are running CatalystOS (CatOS) software release 8.2.x on a Catalyst 6500/6000, refer to the Catalyst 6500 Series Software Configuration Guide, 8.2 and carefully examine any configuration guidelines and restrictions in the Configuring Ethernet VLAN Trunks and Configuring EtherChannel sections.
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
Catalyst 2948G with CatOS 7.1.2 installed (802.1Q only)
Catalyst 2948G-L3 with Cisco IOS Software Release 12.0(14)W5(20) installed
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Conventions
For more information on document conventions, refer to the Cisco Technical Tips Conventions.
Background Theory
The use of EtherChannel can provide increased bandwidth and redundancy. EtherChannel is convenient because it scales the bandwidth without any increase in the complexity of the design. Spanning-tree treats the EtherChannel bundle as a single link, so no loops are introduced. Routing protocols also treat the EtherChannel as a single routed interface with a common IP address. EtherChannel bundling provides up to 1600 Mbps FEC (Fast EtherChannel), full duplex, or 16 Gbps Gigabit EtherChannel (GEC). Trunking carries traffic from several VLANs over a point-to-point link between the two devices. Two methods of trunking are Inter-Switch Link Protocol (ISL, a Cisco-proprietary protocol) or 802.1Q (an IEEE standard). This document specifically deals with 802.1Q trunking.
Configure
In this section, the configurations presented will include a four-port FEC and 802.1Q trunk between the 2948G-L3 and a CatOS switch.

Note: It is quite normal for port 2/2 not to be directly connected to the switch. Output of the show port channel command on the switch that is connected to a router normally looks like this example. Because the router does not participate in PAgP (used to negotiate channels) and the channeling is on, the ports show the FEC neighbor information using Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) data. Cisco IOS software sends out CDP packets on both the channel interface and the physical interfaces. One of the Catalyst ports sees multiple CDP neighbors and reports not directly connected to switch. This is a cosmetic issue, and more information is available in Cisco Bug ID CSCdp04017 (registered customers only) .
show port channel statistics—Displays the Admin Group of the port channel and displays whether PAgP is in use on the port channel.
Verify that PAgP is not in use on the links.
