Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCwa01686 Replace Cisco Table Microphone with Cisco Microphone Array for Panorama
Problem Description
The Cisco Table Microphone does not capture directional audio.
Background
As a part of the development of the Cisco Room Panorama concept, Cisco saw the need for an improved microphone solution to be able to better provide a directional audio experience. As this new microphone was not ready at the same time as Room Panorama, Cisco started shipping with the standard Cisco Table Microphone.
The Cisco Microphone Array is a premium Audio over Ethernet directional microphone for Cisco Room Panorama and Room 70 Panorama systems. It consists of four Electret Condenser Microphones (ECMs) organized in a way so they cover 360 degrees and deliver multiple audio streams.
Participants on the listening side will hear the participants voice coming out of the loudspeaker nearest to the image on the screen, which enables a more natural communication.
You can connect between one and six Cisco Microphone Array units to a Room Panorama or Room 70 Panorama system, dependent on the table size and shape.
Problem Symptom
The Cisco Table Microphone does not capture directional audio.
Workaround/Solution
Workaround
No workaround available.
Solution
If your Cisco Room Panorama or Cisco Room 70 Panorama uses the Cisco Table Microphone today, and you would like a directional audio experience, consider purchasing the Cisco Microphone Array.
Additional Information
What is required to get directional audio?
For the Cisco Room Panorama you can connect between one and six Cisco Microphone Array units to a Room Panorama system, dependent on the table size and shape.
Note: As part of your Cisco Room Panorama installation, you received two Ethernet switches. One for mounting inside the Cisco Room Panorama system, and one for mounting in the meeting room table. The Ethernet switch for mounting in the table is required for this upgrade.
For the Cisco Room 70 Panorama you can connect between one and six Cisco Microphone Array units to a Room 70 Panorama system, dependent on the table size and shape. You also need one Cisco Catalyst 1000 Ethernet switch for mounting on the meeting room table, and one mounting tray for the Cisco Catalyst 1000 Ethernet switch.
Software Requirement
Your Cisco Room Panorama or Cisco Room 70 Panorama solution must run RoomOS 10.8.2.5 or later when using the Cisco Microphone Array.
Installation
See the Cisco Microphone Array Installation Guide for information on how to install the new Microphone Array.
The maximum number of microphones that can be used with the new Microphone Array is now six per system. This might seem like a limitation compared to the previous support for eight Table Microphones. However, keep in mind that these new microphones consist of four ECMs organized in a way so they cover 360 degrees and deliver multiple audio streams. The total coverage will be significantly better with the new microphones despite the reduced number of devices on the table.
Be aware that the new Cisco Microphone Array cannot be combined with the old Cisco Table Microphones or any type of ceiling microphones.
