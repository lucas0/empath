Chapter: Configuring Ethernet Interfaces
Chapter Contents

Fabric Manager and Device Manager display configuration settings and status information about the physical Ethernet interfaces on Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches. However, you cannot change the configuration for physical Ethernet interfaces using Fabric Manager or Device Manager.
This chapter includes the following sections:
•About Ethernet Interfaces
•Displaying Interface Information
•Default Settings
About Ethernet Interfaces
The Ethernet ports can operate as standard Ethernet interfaces connected to servers or to a LAN. The Ethernet interfaces also support Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE). FCoE allows the physical Ethernet link to carry both Ethernet and Fibre Channel traffic.
On a Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch, the Ethernet interfaces are enabled by default.
Displaying Interface Information
Fabric Manager and Device Manager display configuration settings and status information about the physical Ethernet interfaces on Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches.
This section describes how to display the Ethernet interface status and includes the following topics:
•Displaying Interface Information Using Fabric Manager
•Displaying Interface Information Using Device Manager
Displaying Interface Information Using Fabric Manager
To display Ethernet interfaces using Fabric Manager, follow these steps:
Step 1 In the Physical Attributes pane, expand Switches > Interfaces > Ethernet, and then choose Layer2.
You see the Ethernet interface information pane (see Figure 3-1).
The General tab displays the description, speed, MAC address, and status for each Ethernet interface.

Step 2 Click the VLAN tab to display the VLAN assigned to each interface.
Step 3 Click the CDP Neighbors tab to display the CDP neighbor assigned to each interface.
Displaying Interface Information Using Device Manager
To display Ethernet interfaces using Device Manager, follow these steps:
Step 1 Launch Device Manager from the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch.
Step 2 Choose Interface > Ethernet.
You see the Ethernet Interfaces dialog box (see Figure 3-2).
The General tab displays the description, speed, MAC address, and status for each interface.
