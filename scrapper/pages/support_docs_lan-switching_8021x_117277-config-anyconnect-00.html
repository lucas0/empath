Introduction
This document provides a configuration example for Media Access Control Security (MACsec) encryption between an 802.1x supplicant (Cisco AnyConnect Mobile Security) and an authenticator (switch). Cisco Identity Services Engines (ISE) is used as authentication and policy server.
MACsec is standardized in 802.1AE and supported on Cisco 3750X, 3560X, and 4500 SUP7E switches. 802.1AE defines link encryption over wired networks that use out-of-band keys. Those encryption keys are negotiated with the MACsec Key Agreement (MKA) protocol which is utilized after successful 802.1x authentication. MKA is standardized in IEEE 802.1X-2010.
A packet is encrypted only on the link between the PC and the switch (point-to-point encryption). The packet received by the switch is decrypted and sent via uplinks unencrypted. In order to encrypt transmission between the switches, switch-switch encryption is recommended. For that encryption, Security Association Protocol (SAP) is used to negotiate and regenerate keys. SAP is a prestandard key agreement protocol developed by Cisco.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:
Basic knowledge of 802.1x configuration
Basic knowledge of CLI configuration of Catalyst switches
Experience with ISE configuration
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
Microsoft Windows 7 and Microsoft Windows XP operating systems
Cisco 3750X Software, Version 15.0 and later
Cisco ISE Software, Version 1.1.4 and later
Cisco AnyConnect Mobile Security with Network Access Manager (NAM), Version 3.1 and later
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Configure
Network Diagram and Traffic Flow
Step 1. The supplicant (AnyConnect NAM) starts the 802.1x session. The switch is the authenticator and the ISE is the authentication server. Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN (EAPOL) protocol is used as a transport for EAP between the supplicant and the switch. RADIUS is used as a transport protocol for EAP between the switch and the ISE. MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB) cannot be used, because EAPOL keys need to be returned from ISE and used for the MACsec Key Agreement (MKA) session.
Step 2. After the 802.1x session is complete, the switch initiates an MKA session with EAPOL as a transport protocol. If the supplicant is configured correctly, the keys for symmetric 128-bit AES-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) encryption match.
Step 3. All subsequent packets between the supplicant and the switch are encrypted (802.1AE encapsulation).
Configurations
ISE
The ISE configuration involves a typical 802.1x scenario with an exception to the Authorization Profile which might include encryption policies.
Choose Administration > Network Resources > Network Devices in order to add the switch as a network device. Enter a RADIUS preshared key (Shared Secret).
The default authentication rule can be used (for users defined locally on ISE).
Choose Administration > Identity Management > Users in order to define the user "cisco" locally.
The Authorization profile might include encryption policies. As shown in this example, choose Policy > Results > Authorization Profiles in order to view the information ISE returns to the switch that link encryption is mandatory. Also, the VLAN number (10) has been configured.
Choose Policy > Authorization in order to use the authorization profile in the authorization rule. This example returns the configured profile for user "cisco". If 802.1x is successful, ISE returns Radius-Accept to the switch with Cisco AVPair linksec-policy=must-secure. That attribute forces the switch to initiate an MKA session. If that session fails, 802.1x authorization on the switch also fails.
Switch
Typical 802.1x port  settings include (top portion shown):
aaa new-model
aaa authentication dot1x default group radius
aaa authorization network default group radius 

aaa group server radius ISE

 key cisco
The local MKA policy is created and applied to the interface. Also, MACsec is enabled on the interface.
mka policy mka-policy
 replay-protection window-size 5000

interface GigabitEthernet1/0/2
 macsec
 mka policy mka-policy
The local MKA policy allows you to configure detailed settings which cannot be pushed from the ISE. The local MKA policy is optional.
AnyConnect NAM
The profile for the 802.1x supplicant can be configured manually or pushed via Cisco ASA. The next steps present a manual configuration.
In order to manage NAM profiles:
Add a new 802.1x profile with MACsec. For 802.1x, Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP) is used (configured user "cisco" on ISE):
Verify
Use this section to confirm that your configuration works properly.
The AnyConnect NAM configured for EAP-PEAP requires correct credentials.
The session on the switch should be authenticated and authorized. The security status should be "Secured":

Troubleshoot
This section provides information you can use to troubleshoot your configuration.
Debugs for a Working Scenario
Enable debugs on the switch (some output has been omitted for clarity).

debug dot1x all
debug radius
debug radius verbose
After an 802.1x session is established, multiple EAP packets are exchanged over EAPOL. The last successful response from ISE (EAP success) carried inside Radius-Acccept also includes several Radius attributes.
RADIUS: Received from id 1645/40 10.48.66.74:1645, Access-Accept, len 376
RADIUS:  EAP-Key-Name        [102] 67  *
RADIUS:  Vendor, Cisco       [26]  34  
RADIUS:   Cisco AVpair       [1]   28  "linksec-policy=must-secure"
RADIUS:  Vendor, Microsoft   [26]  58  
RADIUS:   MS-MPPE-Send-Key   [16]  52  *
RADIUS:  Vendor, Microsoft   [26]  58  
RADIUS:   MS-MPPE-Recv-Key   [17]  52  *
EAP-Key-Name is used for the MKA session. The linksec-policy forces the switch to use MACsec (authorization fails if that is not complete). Those attributes can be also verified in the packet captures.
Authentication is successful.
%DOT1X-5-SUCCESS: Authentication successful for client (0050.5699.36ce) on 
Interface Gi1/0/2 AuditSessionID C0A8000100000D56FD55B3BF

(0050.5699.36ce) on Interface Gi1/0/2 AuditSessionID C0A8000100000D56FD55B3BF
The switch applies the attributes (these include an optional VLAN number which has also been sent).
%AUTHMGR-5-VLANASSIGN: VLAN 10 assigned to Interface Gi1/0/2 AuditSessionID 
C0A8000100000D56FD55B3BF
The switch then starts the MKA session when it sends and receives EAPOL packets.

Debugs for a Failing Scenario
When the supplicant is not configured for MKA and the ISE requests encryption after a successful 802.1x authentication:
RADIUS: Received from id 1645/224 10.48.66.74:1645, Access-Accept, len 342
%DOT1X-5-SUCCESS: Authentication successful for client (0050.5699.36ce) on

(0050.5699.36ce) on Interface Gi1/0/2 AuditSessionID C0A8000100000D55FD4D7529
The switch tries to initiate an MKA session when it sends 5 EAPOL packets.
%MKA-5-SESSION_START: (Gi1/0/2 : 2) MKA Session started for RxSCI 0050.5699.36ce/0000, 
AuditSessionID C0A8000100000D55FD4D7529, AuthMgr-Handle A4000D56

EAPOL pak dump Tx
dot1x-ev(Gi1/0/2): Sending out EAPOL packet
EAPOL pak dump Tx
dot1x-ev(Gi1/0/2): Sending out EAPOL packet

Data traffic will be blocked.
Packet Captures
When traffic is captured on the supplicant site 4 Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo requests/replies are sent and received, there will be:
4 encrypted ICMP echo requests sent to the switch (88e5 is reserved for 802.1AE)
4 decrypted ICMP echo replies received
That is because of how AnyConnect hooks on Windows API (before libpcap when packets are sent and before libpcap when packets are received):
Note: The ability to sniff MKA or 802.1AE traffic on the switch with features such as Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN) or Embedded Packet Capture (EPC) is not supported.
MACsec and 802.1x Modes
Not all 802.1x modes are supported for MACsec.
The Cisco TrustSec 3.0 How-To Guide: Introduction to MACsec and NDAC states that:
Single-Host Mode: MACsec is fully supported in single-host mode. In this mode, only a single MAC or IP address can be authenticated and secured with MACsec. If a different MAC address is detected on the port after an endpoint has authenticated, a security violation will be triggered on the port.
Multi-Domain Authentication (MDA) Mode: In this mode, one endpoint may be on the data domain and another endpoint may be on the voice domain. MACsec is fully supported in MDA mode. If both endpoints are MACsec-capable, each will be secured by its own independent MACsec session. If only one endpoint is MACsec-capable, that endpoint can be secured while the other endpoint sends traffic in the clear.
Multi-Authentication Mode: In this mode, a virtually unlimited number of endpoints may be authenticated to a single switch port. MACsec is not supported in this mode.
Multi-Host Mode: While MACsec usage in this mode is technically possible, it is not recommended. In Multi-Host Mode, the first endpoint on the port authenticates, and then any additional endpoints will be permitted onto the network via the first authorization. MACsec would work with the first connected host, but no other endpoint’s traffic would actually pass, since it would not be encrypted traffic.
