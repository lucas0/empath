White paper: Establishing the edge
What is edge computing?
Edge computing is a model that shifts computing resources from central data centers or public clouds closer to devices, that is ,embedded at the edge of service provider networks. The goal is to process data with lower latency necessary for many new applications, and to save network cost.
An example use case is Internet of Things (IoT) â€“ billions of IoT devices deployed each year produce lots of data. When the data is processed at the edge instead of the cloud, backhaul cost is reduced. IoT devices expose telemetry needing low latency analysis only achieved at the edge. This improves automation efficiency and equipment utilization.
