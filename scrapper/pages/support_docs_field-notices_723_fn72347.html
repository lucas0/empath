Defect ID Headline
CSCvv95897 DCNM installer on SE wipes drive w/ encrypted and clear fs and certs on it.
Problem Description
A limited number of Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) appliances as mentioned in affected product list shipped with Versions 11.3 and 11.4 will show a failure when you attempt to install the Nexus Dashboard.
Background
The existing DCNM service engine appliances can be upgraded to Nexus Dashboard. Service engine appliances ship with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) partition. Due to an installer bug in DCNM Versions 11.3 and 11.4, this partition was wiped during installation of these versions of DCNM on service engine appliances.
Affected service engine appliances will continue to function as expected if the service engine upgrade to Nexus Dashboard is not required.
Problem Symptom
Affected DCNM service engine appliances cannot upgrade to Nexus Dashboard. When you attempt to upgrade to Nexus Dashboard, the conversion will fail with an error message.
The error seen by the customer is shown here:

01:01:21 O: Error: Cannot install with disabled TPM
01:01:21 I: Finished with exitcode 1
Workaround/Solution
In case the error message from the Problem Symptom section is seen and the serial number shows as impacted in the Serial Number Validation Tool, Cisco recommends to initiate a Return Material Authorization (RMA) replacement as part of the Fix on Fail process.
If SE-CL-L3 was purchased, replace it with three nodes of this Product ID (PID): SE-NODE-G2=.

Note: For security reasons, you must click on the Serial Number Validation Tool link provided in this section to check the serial number for the device. Use of the Serial Number Validation Tool URL external to this field notice will fail.
Upgrade Program

Please enter a valid AFFECTED Serial Number in the Form, if there is not enough space, enter additional serial numbers in the NOTES section.
Depending on material availability, both you AND the Customer email address will receive a confirmation email with Order# within 2 -5 days. Some UMPIRE orders are proactive replacements and do NOT adhere to normal SLAs or Service Contracts.

NOTE: If your Ship to Address is in the following countries, please expect delays of up to 3 months depending on importation regulations: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela, India, All countries in Asia (i.e. Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, China, Vietnam, Korea, Thailand, Philippines), and all non-EU countries (ie: UAE, Russia, Turkey).
