Introduction
This document describes the issue on sessmgr going to  WARN state due to huge number of HTTP flows. This issue is reported on Cisco Aggregrated Service Routers (ASR) 5x00.
Problem
Sessmgr status is WARN and high memory utilization.

These Error logs are generated in the process.There is no subscriber impact due to this error log. As per design once the call is rejected from sessmgr which is in WARN state, system tries at different sessmgrs and call goes through.

Troubleshoot
Capture show support details output and check for the command outputs to troubleshoot further.
The memory problem is related with the amount of flows that the sessmgr handles. The correlation can be seen between sessmgr having high memory consumption and high amount of flows.

You can conclude that there are huge number of HTTP sessions being allocated and this could be due to the heavy HTTP traffic. Also there are almost 1044671491 Calllines, which have greater than 10000 HTTP flows at a time. This leads to high memory usage.
Solution
You have the CLI to limit the number of flows per subscriber
flow limit-across-applications 

Cisco would recommend to configure flow limit-across-applications to 5000 as recommended under all affected Rule-bases where huge number of HTTP Traffic can be seen.
This is the procedure to configure the command
In local context under Global configuration.
# active-charging service ECS
(config-acs)# rulebase GOLIVE
(config-rule-base)# flow limit-across-applications 5000

More information about this command.
flow limit-across-applications
This command allows you to limit the total number of simultaneous flows per Subscriber/APN sent to a rulebase regardless of the flow type, or limit flows based on the protocol type under the Session Control feature.
Product:
ACS

Privilege:
Security Administrator, Administrator

Mode:
Exec > ACS Configuration> Rulebase Configuration

active-charging service service_name > rulebase rulebase_name

Entering the above command sequence results in the following prompt:

[local]host_name(config-rule-base)#

 
Syntax
flow limit-across-applications { limit | non-tcp limit | tcp limit }no flow limit-across-applications [ non-tcp | tcp ] no
If previously configured, deletes the flow limit-across-applications configuration from the current rulebase.
flow limit-across-applications limit
Specifies the maximum number of flows across all applications for the rulebase.
limit must be an integer from 1 through 4000000000.
Default: No limits
non-tcp limit
Specifies the maximum limit of non-TCP type flows.
limit must be an integer from 1 through 4000000000.
Default: No limits
tcp limit
Specifies the maximum limit of TCP flows.
limit must be an integer from 1 through 4000000000.
Default: No limits

Usage:
Use this command to limit the total number of flows allowed for a rulebase regardless of flow type, or limit flows based on the protocolâ€”non-TCP (connection-less) or TCP (connection-oriented).
If a subscriber attempts to exceed these limits system discards the packets of new flow. This limit processing of this command has following aspects for UDP, TCP, ICMP and some of the exempted flows:
UDP/ICMP: System waits for the flow timeout before updating the counter and removing it from the count of number of flows.
TCP: After a TCP flow ends, system waits for a short period of time to accommodate the retransmission of any missed packet from one end. TCP flows those are ended, but are still in wait period for timeout are exempted for this limit processing.
Exempted flows: System exempts all the other flows specified with the flow limit-for-flow-type command in the ACS Charging Action Configuration Mode set to no.

Example:
This command defines the maximum number of 200000 flows for the rulebase:
flow limit-across-applications 200000
