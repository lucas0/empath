    The second generation of Cisco NCS 5500 fabric cards and fan trays enhance the per-slot forwarding capacity of NCS 5500 by 2.7 times.
Product overview
The Cisco Network Convergence System 5500 Series offers industry-leading density of routed 100 Gigabit Ethernet (100 GE) ports for high-scale WAN aggregation. The NCS 5500 Series is designed to efficiently scale between data centers and large enterprises, web, and service provider WAN and aggregation networks. With the introduction of the second generation of fabric cards and fan trays, the forwarding capacity of NCS 5500 modular or line-card-based routers will be augmented by 2.7 times. The second-generation fabric cards and fan trays replace the first generation and a seamless upgrade will be supported. The upgrade will serve to support newer generation NCS 5700 line cards on the three existing variants of modular chassis, NCS5504, NCS 5508 and NCS 5516. Note that the new generation of fabric cards and fan trays are not compatible with their respective previous generation and hence should not be mixed with the first generation of fabric cards and fan trays.
The new fabric cards will offer double the switching capacity per fabric compared to the previous generation, to 1.8 Tbps. And the six fabric cards per chassis will offer up to a total of 10.8 Tbps per slot of bandwidth for every line card. The new fan trays are hot-swappable and will continue to provide front-to-back cooling for all the modules in the chassis. Each fan tray will cover two fabric modules and there will be a total of three fan trays to cover six fabric cards in the system. The second-generation fabric and fans are backward-compatible with all the line cards currently supported on the NCS 5500 Series and are absolutely required for the NCS 5700 line cards with 400GE and 100GE interface ports.
This second generation of fabric cards and fan trays for 16-slot chassis and 8-slot chassis and 4-slot chassis are currently shipping.
Software requirements
The second-generation fabric cards and fan trays for NCS 5500 Series 16-slot chassis (NCS-5516) and 8-slot chassis (NCS-5508) will be supported on Cisco IOS XR Software Release 6.6.25 or later and for NCS-5504 chassis, the second generation fabric cards and fan trays are supported on Cisco IOS XR Software Release 7.2.2 or later.
Features and benefits
Table 1 outlines the features and benefits of the second-generation fabric cards and fan trays for the NCS 5500. Table 2 outlines the new cards’ and trays’ specifications. Table 3 outlines the environmental properties.
