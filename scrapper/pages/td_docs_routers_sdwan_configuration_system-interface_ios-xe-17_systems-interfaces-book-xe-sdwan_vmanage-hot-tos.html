How to Load a Custom vManage Application Server Logo
How to Load a Custom vManage Application Server Logo
To change the Cisco vManage web application server logo and load a new custom logo, use the request nms application-server update-logo command.
The logo image is located in the upper left corner of all Cisco vManage web application server screens. You can load two files, a larger version, which is displayed on wider browser screens, and a smaller version, which is displayed when the screen size narrows. Both files must be PNG files located on the local device, and both must be 1 MB or smaller in size. For best resolution, it is recommended that the image for the large logo be 180 x 33 pixels, and for the small logo 30 x 33 pixels.
