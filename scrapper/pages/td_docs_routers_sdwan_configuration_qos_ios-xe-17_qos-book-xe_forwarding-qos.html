Cisco SD-WAN Forwarding and QoS Overview
Forwarding takes the data packet and sends it over the transport to the remote side, specifying what to do with the packet. It specifies the interface through which packets are sent to reach the service side of a remote router.
Once the control plane connections of the Cisco SD-WAN overlay network are up and running, data traffic flows automatically over the IPsec connections between the routers. Because data traffic never goes to or through the centralized vSmart controller, forwarding only occurs between the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices as they send and receive data traffic.
While the routing protocols running in the control plane provide a router the best route to reach the network that is on the service side of a remote router, there will be situations where it is beneficial to select more specific routes. Using forwarding, there are ways you can affect the flow of data traffic. Forwarding takes the data packet and sends it over the transport to the remote side, specifying what to do with the packet. It specifies the interface through which packets are sent to reach the service side of a remote router.
To modify the default data packet forwarding flow, you create and apply a centralized data policy or a localized data policy. With a centralized data policy, you can manage the paths along which traffic is routed through the network, and you can permit or block traffic based on the address, port, and DSCP fields in the packet's IP header. With a localized data policy, you can control the flow of data traffic into and out of the interfaces of a router, enabling features such as quality of service (QoS).
Traffic Behavior With and Without QoS
Default Behavior without Data Policy
When no centralized data policy is configured on the vSmart controller, all data traffic is transmitted from the local service-side network to the local router, and then to the remote router and the remote service-side network, with no alterations in its path. When no access lists are configured on the local router to implement QoS or mirroring, the data traffic is transmitted to its destination with no alterations to its flow properties.
Let's follow the process that occurs when a data packet is transmitted from one site to another when no data policy of any type is configured:
A data packet arriving from the local service-side network and destined for the remote service-side network comes to the router-1. The packet has a source IP address and a destination IP address.
The router looks up the outbound SA in its VPN route table, and the packet is encrypted with SA and gets the local TLOC. (The router previously received its SA from the vSmart controller. There is one SA per TLOC. More specifically, each TLOC has two SAs, an outbound SA for encryption and an inbound SA for decryption.)
ESP adds an IPsec tunnel header to the packet.
An outer header is added to the packet. At this point, the packet header has these contents: TLOC source address, TLOC destination address, ESP header, destination IP address, and source IP address.
The router checks the local route table to determine which interface the packet should use to reach its destination.
The data packet is sent out on the specified interface, onto the network, to its destination. At this point, the packet is being transported within an IPsec connection.
When the packet is received by the router on the remote service-side network, the TLOC source address and TLOC destination address header fields are removed, and the inbound SA is used to decrypt the packet.
The remote router looks up the destination IP address in its VPN route table to determine the interface to use to reach to the service-side destination.
The figure below details this process.
Figure 1. Data Packet Transmission without Policy
Behavior Changes with QoS Data Policy
When you want to modify the default packet forwarding flow, you design and provision QoS policy. To activate the policy, you apply it to specific interfaces in the overlay network in either the inbound or the outbound direction. The direction is with respect to the routers in the network. You can have policies for packets coming in on an interface or for packets going out of an interface.
The figure below illustrates the QoS policies that you can apply to a data packet as it is transmitted from one branch to another. The policies marked Input are applied on the inbound interface of the router, and the policies marked Output are applied on the outbound interface of the router, before the packets are transmitted out the IPSec tunnel.
The table below describes each of the above steps.

How QoS Works
The QoS feature on the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices and Cisco vEdge devices works by examining packets entering at the edge of the network. With localized data policy, also called access lists, you can provision QoS to classify incoming data packets into multiple forwarding classes based on importance, spread the classes across different interface queues, and schedule the transmission rate level for each queue. Access lists can be applied either in the outbound direction on the interface (as the data packet travels from the local service-side network into the IPsec tunnel toward the remote service-side network) or in the inbound direction (as data packets are exiting from the IPsec tunnel and being received by the local router.
To provision QoS, you must configure each router in the network. Generally, each router on the local service-side network examines the QoS settings of the packets that enter it, determines which class of packets are transmitted first, and processes the transmission based on those settings. As packets leave the network on the remote service-side network, you can rewrite the QoS bits of the packets before transmitting them to meet the policies of the targeted peer router.
Classify Data Packets
You can classify incoming traffic by associating each packet with a forwarding class. Forwarding classes group data packets for transmission to their destination. Based on the forwarding class, you assign packets to output queues. The routers service the output queues according to the associated forwarding, scheduling, and rewriting policies you configure.
Schedule Data Packets
You can configure a QoS map for each output queue to specify the bandwidth. This enables you to determine how to prioritize data packets for transmission to the destination. Depending on the priority of the traffic, you can assign packets higher or lower bandwidth, buffer levels, and drop profiles. Based on the conditions defined in the QoS map, packets are forwarded to the next hop.
On Cisco vEdge devices and Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices, each interface has eight queues, which are numbered 0 to 7. Queue 0 is reserved, and is used for both control traffic and low-latency queuing (LLQ) traffic. For LLQ, any class that is mapped to queue 0 must also be configured to use LLQ. Queues 1 to 7 are available for data traffic, and the default scheduling for these seven queues is weighted round-robin (WRR). For these queues, you can define the weighting according to the needs of your network. When QoS is not configured for data traffic, queue 2 is the default queue.
Rewrite Data Packets
You can configure and apply rewrite rules on the egress interface to overwrite the Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) value for packets entering the network. Rewrite rules allow you to map traffic to code points when the traffic exits the system. Rewrite rules use the forwarding class information and packet loss priority (PLP) used internally by the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices and Cisco vEdge devices to establish the DSCP value on outbound packets. You can then configure algorithms such as RED/WRED to set the probability that packets will be dropped based on their DSCP value.
Police Data Packets
You can configure policers to control the maximum rate of traffic sent or received on an interface, and to partition a network into multiple priority levels.
Shaping Rate
You can configure shaping to control the maximum rate of traffic sent. You can configure the aggregate traffic rate on an interface to be less than the line rate so that the interface transmits less traffic than it is capable of transmitting. You can apply shaping to outbound interface traffic.
Limitations for Forwarding on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices
Mirroring is not supported.
Delaying buffer size is not supported.
Specifying packet loss priority (PLP) is not supported.

Forwarding and QoS Configuration Using the CLI
This section shows examples of how you can use access lists to configure quality of service (QoS), classifying data packets and prioritizing the transmission properties for different classes. Note that QoS is synonymous with class of service (CoS).
This example shows how to configure class of service (CoS) to classify data packets and control how traffic flows out of and into the interfaces on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices on the interface queues. To configure a QoS policy:
Map each forwarding class to an output queue.
Configure the QoS scheduler for each forwarding class.
Define an access list to specify match conditions for packet transmission and apply it to a specific interface.
Apply the queue map and the rewrite rule to the egress interface.
The sections below show examples of each of these steps.

Configure and Apply Rewrite Rule
Configure Rewrite Rule
This example shows how to configure the rewrite rule to overwrite the DSCP field of the outer IP header. Here the rewrite rule "transport" overwrites the DSCP value for forwarding classes based on the drop profile. Since all classes are configured with RED drop, they can have one of two profiles: high drop or low drop. The rewrite rule is applied only on the egress interface, so on the way out, packets classified as "af1" and a Packet Loss Priority (PLP) level of low are marked with a DSCP value of 3 in the IP header field, while "af1" packets with a PLP level of high are marked with 4. Similarly, "af2" packets with a PLP level of low are marked with a DSCP value of 5, while "af2" packets with a PLP level of high are marked with 6, and so on.
Apply the Queue Map and Rewrite Rule to the Egress Interface
This example applies the queue map "test" and the rewrite rule "transport" to the egress interface. (Note that you can apply QOS maps to VLAN interfaces, also called subinterfaces, on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices (not on Cisco vEdge devices), using Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Release 16.12.x or later, or Cisco SD-WAN Release 19.1.x or later.)

Apply a Rewrite Rule for Outgoing Traffic in a Carrier Supporting Carrier Scenario
In carrier supporting carrier (CSC) scenarios, which use MPLS, the rewrite-rule command assigns the MPLS EXP value in the MPLS header for outgoing traffic. Use the rewrite-rule command using a CLI template or CLI add-on template, and the mpls-exp-topmost keyword. If, in a CSC scenario, you use the dscp keyword instead, such as with legacy configurations created before support of the mpls-exp-topmost keyword, the rewrite-rule command converts the DSCP value to an MPLS EXP value in accordance with the standard mapping of DSCP to MPLS EXP values. The benefit of using the mpls-exp-topmost keyword is that you can set the MPLS EXP value directly, without depending on the mapping of DSCP to MPLS EXP values.
The following example applies to a CSC scenario. It defines a rewrite rule called rw-exp, which sets the MPLS EXP value for outgoing traffic to 1 and applies the rule to the outbound interface.
Define the rewrite rule using the mpls-exp-topmost keyword, as follows:
sdwan
  policy
    rewrite-rule rw-exp
      class BULK low mpls-exp-topmost 1
      class BULK high mpls-exp-topmost 1
Alternatively, if you define the rewrite rule using the dscp keyword, the rewrite-rule command converts the value of 10 to an MPLS EXP value of 1, in accordance with the standard mapping of DSCP to MPLS EXP values.
sdwan
  policy
    rewrite-rule rw-exp
      class BULK low dscp 10
      class BULK high dscp 10
Apply the rule as follows:

  tunnel-interface
   encapsulation ipsec weight 1
   no border
   color public-internet restrict
  exit
  rewrite-rule rw-exp
