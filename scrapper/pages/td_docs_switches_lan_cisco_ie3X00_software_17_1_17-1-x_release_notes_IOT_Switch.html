Feature Name
License Level
Description, and Documentation Link Information
EIGRP
(ie3300 and ie3400 only)
Network Advantage
Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) is an interior gateway protocol suited for many different topologies and media. In a well designed network, EIGRP scales well and provides extremely quick convergence times with minimal network traffic.
Layer 3 Multicast support (ie3300 and ie3400 only)
Network Essentials
IP multicast is a bandwidth-conserving technology that reduces traffic by simultaneously delivering a single stream of information to potentially thousands of corporate recipients and homes. Applications that take advantage of multicast include video conferencing, corporate communications, distance learning, and distribution of software, stock quotes, and news.
This release adds Multicast support over Layer 3 interfaces.
PAgP Port channel support
Network Essentials
The Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) is a Cisco-proprietary protocol that can be run only on Cisco switches and on those switches licensed by vendors to support PAgP.
Profinet Support - (Not supported on the ESS3300)
Network Essentials
PROFINET is the PROFIBUS International (PI) open Industrial Ethernet Standard that uses TCP/IP and IT standards for automation control. PROFINET is particularly useful for industrial automation systems and process control networks, in which motion control and precision control of instrumentation and test equipment are important. It emphasizes data exchange and defines communication paths to meet speed requirements.
PROFINET-MRP- (Not supported on the ESS3300)
Network Essentials
After activating the license, you can push PROFINET MRP configuration to the Cisco switch using Siemens TIA or STEP7. PROFINET MRP is enabled by default on the switch when MRM or MRC licenses are enabled.
Routing Protocol support (Ipv4 and Ipv6) - ISIS (ie3300 and ie3400 only)
Network Advantage
This module provides a technical overview of the Integrated Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing protocol. IS-IS is a link-state Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP). Link-state protocols are characterized by the propagation of the information required to build a complete network connectivity map on each participating device. That map is then used to calculate the shortest path to destinations.

Network Essentials
Serviceability CLIs are added for many new features to enable customer/TAC engineers to collect debug information in a simple and easier way. Please note that, MRP needs a feature license activated to work.
BGP (ie3300 and ie3400 only, not supported on ESS3300)
Network Advantage
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an interdomain routing protocol designed to provide loop-free routing between separate routing domains that contain independent routing policies (autonomous systems).
RIP
Network Advantage
RIP is a commonly used routing protocol in small to medium TCP/IP networks. Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is a stable protocol that uses a distance-vector algorithm to calculate routes.
HTTP over IPv6
Network Essentials

Complete List of Supported Features
For the complete list of features supported on a platform, see the Cisco Feature Navigator at https://www.cisco.com/go/cfn.
Accessing Hidden Commands
Hidden commands have always been present in Cisco IOS XE, but were not equipped with CLI help. This means that entering enter a question mark (?) at the system prompt did not display the list of available commands. Such hidden commands are only meant to assist Cisco TAC in advanced troubleshooting and are therefore not documented. For more information about CLI help, see the Using the Command-Line Interface → Understanding the Help System chapter of the Command Reference document.
This section provides information about hidden commands in Cisco IOS XE and the security measures in place, when they are accessed. Hidden commands are meant to assist Cisco TAC in advanced troubleshooting and are therefore not documented. For more information about CLI help, see the Using the Command-Line Interface → Understanding the Help System chapter of the Command Reference document.
Hidden commands are available under:
Category 1—Hidden commands in privileged or User EXEC mode. Begin by entering the service internal command to access these commands.
Category 2—Hidden commands in one of the configuration modes (global, interface and so on). These commands do not require the service internal command.
Further, the following applies to hidden commands under Category 1 and 2:
The commands have CLI help. Entering enter a question mark (?) at the system prompt displays the list of available commands.

Note
For Category 1, enter the service internal command before you enter the question mark; you do not have to do this for Category 2.
The system generates a %PARSER-5-HIDDEN syslog message when the command is used. For example:
*Feb 14 10:44:37.917: %PARSER-5-HIDDEN: Warning!!! 'show processes memory old-header ' is a hidden command. 
Use of this command is not recommended/supported and will be removed in future.
Apart from category 1 and 2, there remain internal commands displayed on the CLI, for which the system does NOT generate the %PARSER-5-HIDDEN syslog message.

Important
We recommend that you use any hidden command only under TAC supervision. If you find that you are using a hidden command, open a TAC case for help with finding another way of collecting the same information as the hidden command (for a hidden EXEC mode command), or to configure the same functionality (for a hidden configuration mode command) using non-hidden commands.

Add-on licenses (DNA Advantage) are ordered and fulfilled only with a term license type.
An add-on license level is included when you choose a network license level. If you use DNA features, renew the license before term expiry, to continue using it, or deactivate the add-on license and then reload the switch to continue operating with the base license capabilities.
Evaluation licenses cannot be ordered. They are not tracked via Cisco Smart Software Manager and expire after a 90-day period. Evaluation licenses can be used only once on the switch and cannot be regenerated. Warning system messages about an evaluation license expiry are generated only 275 days after expiration and every week thereafter. An expired evaluation license cannot be reactivated after reload.

Note
Network Essentials license is the default license. It is permanent. A connection to the Smart Licensing server is not required if the IE switch will be deployed with a Network Essentials license.
Smart Licensing
Cisco Smart Licensing is a unified license management system that manages all the software licenses across Cisco products.
It enables you to purchase, deploy, manage, track and renew Cisco Software. It provides information about license ownership and consumption through a single user interface.
The solution is composed of Smart Accounts and Cisco Smart Software Manager. The former is an online account of your Cisco software assets and is required to use the latter. Cisco Smart Software Manager is where you can perform all your licensing management related tasks, such as, registering, de-registering, moving, and transferring licenses. Users can be added and given access and permissions to the smart account and specific virtual accounts.

Important
Cisco Smart Licensing is the default and the only available method to manage licenses on IE3x00 products.
Deploying Smart Licensing
The following provides a process overview of a day 0 to day N deployment directly initiated from a device. Links to the configuration guide provide detailed information to help you complete each one of the smaller tasks.
Procedure
Step 1
Begin by establishing a connection from your network to Cisco Smart Software Manager on cisco.com.
Step 2
Create and activate your Smart Account, or login if you already have one.
To create and activate Smart Account, go to Cisco Software Central → Create Smart Accounts. Only authorized users can activate the Smart Account.
Step 3
Complete the Cisco Smart Software Manager set up.
Accept the Smart Software Licensing Agreement.
Set up the required number of Virtual Accounts, users and access rights for the virtual account users.
Virtual accounts help you organize licenses by business unit, product type, IT group, and so on.
With this,
The device is now in an authorized state and ready to use.
The licenses that you have purchased are displayed in your Smart Account.
What to do next
Register and convert traditional licenses to Smart Licenses.
Using Smart Licensing on an Out-of-the-Box Device
If an out-of-the-box device has the software version factory-provisioned, all licenses on such a device remain in evaluation mode until registered in Cisco Smart Software Manager.
How Upgrading or Downgrading Software Affects Smart Licensing
Note how upgrading to a release that supports Smart Licensing or moving to a release that does not support Smart Licensing affects licenses on a device:
When you upgrade from an earlier release to one that supports Smart Licensing—all existing licenses remain in evaluation mode until registered in Cisco Smart Software Manager. After registration, they are made available in your Smart Account.
When you downgrade to a release where Smart Licensing is not supported—all smart licenses on the device are converted to traditional licenses and all smart licensing information on the device is removed.
Known Issues
This section contains information about the known issues in this release.
IGMP Snooping and Unregistered Multicast Packet Forwarding
Symptoms: Although the mrouter port is configured and multicast receivers have sent igmp-joins to listen to registered multicast streams, unknown multicast streams that ingress the switch are forwarded to all the ports. The flooding may lead to reduction in bandwidth for registered multicast traffic.
Conditions: The issue occurs when the switch receives unregistered multicast packets with a pure L2 configuration and an external IGMP snooping querier is configured on the VLAN. There should not be a membership join received on any VLAN ports.
Workaround: To stop the VLAN, execute the command switchport block multicast on that interface, as shown in the following example:
Switch#configure terminal
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
Switch(config)#interface gigabitEthernet 1/10
Switch(config-if)#switchport block ?        
  multicast  Block unknown multicast addresses
  unicast    Block unknown unicast addresses
 
Switch(config-if)#switchport block mu
Switch(config-if)#switchport block multicast  
Caveats
Caveats describe unexpected behavior in Cisco IOS XE releases. Caveats listed as open in a prior release are carried forward to the next release as either open or resolved.
Cisco Bug Search Tool
The Cisco Bug Search Tool (BST) allows partners and customers to search for software bugs based on product, release, and keyword, and aggregates key data such as bug details, product, and version. The BST is designed to improve the effectiveness in network risk management and device troubleshooting. The tool has a provision to filter bugs based on credentials to provide external and internal bug views for the search input.

Although the format command provides options of file systems such as FAT16,FAT32,ext2,ext3, it internally always formats it to "vfat" file system. Hence, it would not be possible to store files bigger than 4gb on the USB flash.For any reason, if we have to store files bigger than 4gb on the USB flash inserted on the switch, the work around is to format it to ext2/ext3 file system types externally and use it on the switch.Then switch correctly identifies the USB flash file system as ext2/ext3 and will be able to store files bigger than 4gb.
