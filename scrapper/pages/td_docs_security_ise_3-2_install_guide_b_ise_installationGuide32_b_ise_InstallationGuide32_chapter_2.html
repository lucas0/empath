Hardware and Virtual Appliance Requirements for Cisco ISE
Cisco Identity Services Engine (Cisco ISE) can be installed on Cisco Secure Network Server (SNS) hardware or virtual appliances. To achieve performance and scalability comparable to the Cisco ISE hardware appliance, the virtual machine should be allocated system resources equivalent to the Cisco SNS hardware appliances. This section lists the hardware, software, and virtual machine requirements required to install Cisco ISE.

Note
Harden your virtual environment and ensure that all the security updates are up-to-date. Cisco is not liable for any security issues found in hypervisors.

Note
Cisco ISE does not support VM snapshots for backing up ISE data on any of the virtual environments (VMware, Linux KVM, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Nutanix AHV) because a VM snapshot saves the status of a VM at a given point in time. In a multi-node Cisco ISE deployment, data in all the nodes are continuously synchronized with current database information. Restoring a snapshot might cause database replication and synchronization issues. We recommend that you use the backup functionality included in Cisco ISE for archival and restoration of data. Using snapshots to back up ISE data results in stopping Cisco ISE services. A reboot is required to bring up the ISE node.

Caution
If the Snapshot feature is enabled on the VM, it might corrupt the VM configuration. If this issue occurs, you might have to reimage the VM and disable VM snapshot.

Support for Cisco Secure Network Server 3700 Series Appliance
Support for Cisco Secure Network Server 3700 Series Appliance
The Cisco Secure Network Server (SNS) 3700 series appliances are based on the Cisco Unified Computing System (Cisco UCS) C220 Rack Server and are specifically configured to support Cisco ISE. Cisco SNS 3700 series appliances are designed to deliver high performance and efficiency for a wide range of workloads.
The Cisco SNS 3700 series appliances are available in the following models:
Cisco SNS 3715 (SNS-3715-K9)
Cisco SNS 3755 (SNS-3755-K9)
Cisco SNS 3795 (SNS-3795-K9)
The Cisco SNS 3715 appliance is designed for small deployments. Cisco SNS 3755 and Cisco SNS 3795 appliances have several redundant components such as hard disks and power supplies and are suitable for larger deployments that require highly reliable system configurations. Cisco SNS 3795 is recommended for PAN and MnT personas.
Cisco ISE Release 3.1 Patch 6 and above and Cisco ISE Release 3.2 Patch 2 and above versions support Cisco SNS 3700 series appliances.
The following table describes the hardware specifications of Cisco SNS 3700 series appliances.

VMware Virtual Machine Requirements for Cisco ISE
You can use the VMware migration feature to migrate virtual machine (VM) instances (running any persona) between hosts. Cisco ISE supports both hot and cold migration.
Hot migration is also called live migration or vMotion. Cisco ISE need not be shutdown or powered off during the hot migration. You can migrate the Cisco ISE VM without any interruption in its availability.
Cisco ISE must be shutdown and powered off for cold migration. Cisco ISE does not allow to stop or pause the database operations during cold migration. Hence, ensure that Cisco ISE is not running and active during the cold migration.

Note
You must use the application stop command before using the halt command or powering off the VM to prevent database corruption issues.
Cisco ISE offers the following OVA templates that you can use to install and deploy Cisco ISE on virtual machines (VMs):
ISE-3.2.0.542-virtual-SNS3615-SNS3655-300.ova
ISE-3.2.0.542-virtual-SNS3615-SNS3655-600.ova
ISE-3.2.0.542-virtual-SNS3655-SNS3695-1200.ova
ISE-3.2.0.542-virtual-SNS3695-1800.ova

Note
If you want to import the SNS 3695 OVA template to the VMware vCenter content library, you can use the ISE-3.2.0.542-virtual-SNS3695-1800.ova template. This OVA template is similar to the ISE-3.2.0.542-virtual-SNS3695-2400.ova template, except for the reserved disk size, which has been reduced from 2400 GB to 1800 GB to workaround a limitation in the Vmware vCenter content library that prevents import of OVAs with disk size larger than 2 TB.
ISE-3.2.0.542-virtual-SNS3695-2400.ova
The 300 GB OVA templates are sufficient for Cisco ISE nodes that serve as dedicated Policy Service or pxGrid nodes.
The 600 GB and 1.2 TB OVA templates are recommended to meet the minimum requirements for ISE nodes that run the Administration or Monitoring persona.
If you need to customize the disk size, CPU, or memory allocation, you can manually deploy Cisco ISE using the standard .iso image. However, it is important that you ensure the minimum requirements and resource reservations specified in this document are met. The OVA templates simplify ISE virtual appliance deployment by automatically applying the minimum resources required for each platform.

Hard Disks
Evaluation: 300 GB
Production
300 GB to 2.4 TB of disk storage (size depends on deployment and tasks).
See the recommended disk space for VMs in the following link: Disk Space Requirements.
We recommend that your VM host server use hard disks with a minimum speed of 10,000 RPM.
Note
  When you create the Virtual Machine for Cisco ISE, use a single virtual disk that meets the storage requirement. If you use more than one virtual disk to meet the disk space requirement, the installer may not recognize all the disk space.
Storage and File System
The storage system for the Cisco ISE virtual appliance requires a minimum write performance of 50 MB per second and a read performance of 300 MB per second. Deploy a storage system that meets these performance criteria and is supported by VMware server.
You can use the show tech-support command to view the read and write performance metrics.
We recommend the VMFS file system because it is most extensively tested, but other file systems, transports, and media can also be deployed provided they meet the above requirements.
Disk Controller
Paravirtual or LSI Logic Parallel
For best performance and redundancy, a caching RAID controller is recommended. Controller options such as RAID 10 (also known as 1+0) can offer higher overall write performance and redundancy than RAID 5, for example. Additionally, battery-backed controller cache can significantly improve write operations.
Note
  Updating the disk SCSI controller of an ISE VM from another type to VMware Paravirtual may render it not bootable.
NIC
1 NIC interface required (two or more NICs are recommended; six NICs are supported). Cisco ISE supports E1000E and VMXNET3 adapters.
Note
  You have to remap the ESXi adapter to synchronize it with the ISE adapter order.

Cisco ISE on VMware Cloud Solutions
On any public cloud platform, you must configure your VPN to enable reachability from the VMware engine to on-premises deployments, and other required devices and services. You can deploy Cisco ISE on VMware cloud solutions on the following public cloud platforms:
VMware Cloud on Amazon Web Services (AWS): Host Cisco ISE on a software-defined data center offered by VMware Cloud on AWS. Configure the appropriate security group policies on VMware Cloud (in the Networking and Security > Security > Gateway Firewall Settings window) to enable reachability to on-premises deployments, and other required devices and services.
Azure VMware Solution: Azure VMware Solution runs VMware workloads natively on Microsoft Azure. You can host Cisco ISE as a VMware virtual machine.
Google Cloud VMware Engine: The Google Cloud VMware Engine runs software-defined data centers by VMware. You can host Cisco ISE as a VMware virtual machine using the VMware Engine.
For more information on deploying Cisco ISE on cloud platforms, see Deploy Cisco Identity Services Engine Natively on Cloud Platforms.
Virtual Machine Appliance Size Recommendations for Cisco ISE
The virtual machine (VM) appliance specifications should be comparable with physical appliances run in a production environment.
Keep the following guidelines in mind when allocating resources for the appliance:
Failure to allocate the specified resources might result in performance degradation or service failure. We highly recommend that you deploy dedicated VM resources and not share or oversubscribe resources across multiple guest VMs. Deploying Cisco ISE virtual appliances using the OVF templates ensures that adequate resources are assigned to each VM. If you do not use OVF templates, then ensure that you assign the equivalent resource reservations when you manually install Cisco ISE using the ISO image.

Note
If you choose to deploy Cisco ISE manually without the recommended reservations, you must assume the responsibility to closely monitor your appliance’s resource utilization and increase resources, as needed, to ensure proper health and functioning of the Cisco ISE deployment.
If you are using the OVA templates for installation, check the following settings after the installation is complete:
Ensure that you assign the resource reservations that are specified in the VMware Virtual Machine Requirements for Cisco ISE section in the CPU/Memory Reservation field (under the Virtual Hardware tab in the Edit Settings window) to ensure proper health and functioning of the Cisco ISE deployment.
Ensure that the CPU usage in the CPU Limit field (under the Virtual Hardware tab in the Edit Settings window) is set to Unlimited. Setting a limit for CPU usage (for example, setting the CPU usage limit as 12000 MHz) will impact the system performance. If limit has been set, you must shutdown the VM client, remove the limit, and the restart the VM client.
Ensure that the memory usage in the Memory Limit field (under the Virtual Hardware tab in the Edit Settings window) is set to Unlimited. Setting a limit for memory usage (for example, setting the limit as 12000 MB) will impact the system performance.
Ensure that the Shares option is set as High in the Hard Disk area (under the Virtual Hardware tab in the Edit Settings window).
Admin and MnT nodes rely heavily on disk usage. Using shared disk storage VMware environment might affect the disk performance. You must increase the number of disk shares allocated to a node to increase the performance of the node.
Policy Service nodes on VMs can be deployed with less disk space than Administration or Monitoring nodes. The minimum disk space for any production Cisco ISE node is 300 GB.
VMs can be configured with 1 to 6 NICs. The recommendation is to allow for 2 or more NICs. Additional interfaces can be used to support various services such as profiling, guest services, or RADIUS.

Note
RAM and CPU adjustments on VM do not require re-image.
Disk Space Requirements for VMs in a Cisco ISE Deployment
The following table lists the Cisco ISE disk-space allocation recommended for running a virtual machine in a production deployment.

Note
You must change the firmware from BIOS to EFI in the boot mode of VM settings to boot GPT partition with 2 TB or above.

Note
Additional disk space is required to store local debug logs, staging files, and to handle log data during upgrade, when the Primary Administration node temporarily becomes a Monitoring node.
Disk Space Guidelines for Cisco ISE
Keep the following guidelines in mind when deciding the disk space for Cisco ISE:
Cisco ISE must be installed on a single disk in virtual machine.
Disk allocation varies based on logging retention requirements. On any node that has the Monitoring persona enabled, 60 percent of the VM disk space is allocated for log storage. A deployment with 25,000 endpoints generates approximately 1 GB of logs per day.
For example, if you have a Monitoring node with 600-GB VM disk space, 360 GB is allocated for log storage. If 100,000 endpoints connect to this network every day, it generates approximately 4 GB of logs per day. In this case, you can store 76 days of logs in the Monitoring node, after which you must transfer the old data to a repository and purge it from the Monitoring database.
For extra log storage, you can increase the VM disk space. For every 100 GB of disk space that you add, you get 60 GB more for log storage.
If you increase the disk size of your virtual machine after initial installation, perform a fresh installation of Cisco ISE. A fresh installation helps properly detect and utilize the full disk allocation.
The following table lists the number of days that RADIUS logs can be retained on your Monitoring node based on the allocated disk space and the number of endpoints that connect to your network. The numbers are based on the following assumptions: Ten or more authentications per day per endpoint with logging suppression enabled.

Increase Disk Size
If you find that context and visibility functions are slow, or you are running out of room for logs, you must allocate more disk space.
To plan for more log storage, for every 100 GB of disk space that you add, 60 GB is available for log storage.
In order for ISE to detect and utilize the new disk allocation, you must deregister the node, update the VM settings, and reinstall ISE. One way to do this is to install ISE on a new larger node, and add that node to the deployment as high availability. After the nodes have synchronized, make the new VM the primary and deregister the original VM.
Decrease Disk Size
After you install Cisco ISE on a VM, you must not reduce the VM reservations. If you reduce the VM memory to less than what Cisco ISE services require, Cisco ISE services fail to come up due to insufficient resources.
After you install Cisco ISE, if you must reconfigure your VM, then carry out the following steps:
Perform backup of Cisco ISE.
Reimage Cisco ISE with the changed VM configuration as needed.
Restore Cisco ISE.
