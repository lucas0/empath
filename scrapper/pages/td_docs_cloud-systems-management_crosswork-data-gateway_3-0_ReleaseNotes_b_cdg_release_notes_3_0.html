Initial Release.
Product Overview
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway is a model-driven scalable data collection platform that enables real-time data collection from multi-protocol capable devices, thereby reducing the need for multiple collection points for multiple applications requiring data from the network.
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway offers central visibility into services collecting data and the type of data being collected. It can also be used to feed external data destinations (such as, an external Kafka or gRPC server) in addition to Crosswork applications.
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway is not a standalone product and is expected to be used with Crosswork on-premise or Crosswork Cloud applications. There is no separate software license needed for Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway. Use of Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway to forward data to third-party destinations is only supported when using the Crosswork Data Gateway with Crosswork on-premise applications and requires a separate license.
Release Details
Cisco releases updated builds on the Cisco Support & Software Download site.

Management Traffic
Control/Data Traffic
Device Access Traffic
Management traffic: for accessing the UIs and command line and passing configuration information between servers (for example, a Crosswork application to Crosswork Data Gateway).
Control/Data traffic: for data and configuration transfer between Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway and Crosswork applications and other external data destinations.
Device access traffic: for device management (NSO or a Crosswork application to the devices as a result of KPI configuration or playbook execution) and telemetry data being forwarded to the Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway.
(*) - For live deployments, we recommend 3 NIC deployment, that is one interface for all the management traffic (VMs to DNS, NTP, and the network you will use to access and manage the applications), second interface for the data network (connection between Cisco Crosswork and the Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway VM) and third interface to communicate with devices in the network.
IP Addresses
1, 2, or 3 IPv4/IPv6 addresses based on the number of interfaces you choose to use.
Note 
Cisco Crosswork does not support dual stack configurations. Therefore, ALL addresses for the environment must be either IPv4 or IPv6.
NTP Servers
The IPv4/IPv6 addresses or host names of the NTP servers you plan to use. If you want to enter multiple NTP servers, separate them with spaces. These should be the same NTP servers you use to synchronize devices, clients, and servers across your network. Confirm that the NTP IP address or host name is reachable on the network or installation will fail.
The Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway host and virtual machine must be synchronized to an NTP server or the initial handshake may fail with "certificate not valid" errors.
DNS Servers
The IPv4/IPv6 addresses of the DNS servers you plan to use. These should be the same DNS servers you use to resolve host names across your network.
DNS Search Domain
The search domain you want to use with the DNS servers (for example, cisco.com). You can only have one search domain.
Tested Cisco OS
The following table lists the software versions with which Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway 3.0 was tested. Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway allows you to expand device coverage by means of custom packages (see Section: Manage Custom Software Packages in Cisco Crosswork Infrastructure 4.1 and Applications Administration Guide).

Crosswork Data Gateway can collect data from compatible third-party devices using SNMP or gNMI collectors. For information about deploying and validating non-Cisco collections, see Cisco Devnet or contact Cisco Professional Services.
Scale Support
Crosswork Data Gateway (Standard deployment profile) is tested with up to 2000 devices integrated with Crosswork Network Controller running Crosswork Optimization Engine and Crosswork Active Topology. The number of Crosswork Data Gateway VMs required varies based on a combination of factors such as the number and type of collection jobs, the number of destinations data is forwarded to, and other variables. To determine if your configuration requires additional Crosswork Data Gateway VMs, see Monitor Crosswork Data Gateway Health and for information on how to add a Crosswork Data Gateway VM to the pool, see Attach Devices to a Crosswork Data Gateway.
