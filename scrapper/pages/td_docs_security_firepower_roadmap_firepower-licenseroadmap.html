Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center Feature Licenses
The Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center feature license type required depends on the software running on the managed device. Secure Firewall Threat Defense devices use Smart licenses, while all other devices use Classic licenses. The management center hardware does not require a license, but the Secure Firewall Management Center Virtual requires an entitlement for each device it will manage. For managed device hardware that is not running threat defense software, see the documentation for your software product.

Management Center Hardware Model or Virtual Platform
License Requirements
Management Center hardware (all models)
No license is required for management center hardware.
The management center can manage devices that use both Smart and Classic licenses.
Management Center Virtual (all platforms)
The management center virtual requires an entitlement for each device it will manage, whether the devices use Smart or Classic licensing.
Starting in release 6.7, the management center virtual in a high-availability pair consume a license for each registered device in the configuration.
Required License Type (Smart or Classic) for Managed Devices
Generally, it is the software, not the hardware, that determines whether your device requires a Classic or Smart License.

Note
Some hardware supports either Classic or Smart Licenses, depending on the software running on the device. Make sure you purchase and activate the correct license type for your software.
For details, see licensing information for the software product that will run on the device.
If you activate the wrong license type, contact Cisco TAC.
Use the information below to determine whether your product requires Classic or Smart Licenses.
