Guidelines for RONA
For voice calls, follow these guidelines to obtain accurate and useful data when using Redirection on No Answer (RONA) to respond to unanswered calls:
Within the routing script, plan to enable the Target Requery option in the routing script. Target Requery is available from the Queue, Queue to Agent, Label, Select, and RouteSelect nodes.
Decide and configure how long a call is to ring before being redirected to a new agent or skill group.
When deciding how long a call is to ring, consider how RONA calls affect the Service Level. If you want RONA calls to adversely affect the Service Level, the amount of time the call is allowed to ring before being redirected must be above the Service Level threshold time.
Configure the number to dial to redirect calls that agents do not answer within the ring no answer time. You configure the ring no answer dialed number in the Agent Desk Settings tool in Configuration Manager.
Plan to create a separate call type for RONA situations and to associate this call type with the ring no answer dialed number.
Using a separate call type enables you to redirect calls that are not answered to a script that queues the calls at a higher priority. It also enables you to report on activity for the RONA call type. Viewing data for this call type helps you gain insight into the number of calls that redirect on no answer. Viewing data for this call type also helps you see how the calls are finally handled.
Plan to create a separate script that is associated with the RONA call type.
In the Redirection on No Answer Script, queue the calls at a higher priority. The call variables set in the first script are carried over into the second script and you can use these variables if you choose.
Change the call type in the script after the requery and create a path for calls that are required within the script.
For nonvoice tasks routed to Webex CCE by third-party multichannel applications that use the Task Routing APIs, follow these guidelines when using Redirection on No Answer (RONA) to respond to unanswered tasks:
Within the routing script, plan to use the ServiceRequested call variable to identify RONA tasks. This call variable is set to 3 when Task Routing tasks RONA. You can raise the priority of tasks that RONA so that they go to the front of the queue.
For scripting information for Task Routing for third-party multichannel applications, see the Scripting and Media Routing Guide for Cisco Unified ICM/Contact Center Enterprise at https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/customer-collaboration/unified-contact-center-enterprise/products-user-guide-list.html.
Configure the Start Timeout setting for the MRD to specify how long a task is to wait on an agent's desktop before being redirected to a new agent or skill group. This setting is in the Webex CCE Administration Media Routing Domain tool.
Consider how RONA calls affect the Service Level. If you want RONA calls to adversely affect the Service Level, the amount of time the call is allowed to ring before being redirected must be above the Service Level threshold time.
For configuration instructions for Task Routing for third-party multichannel applications, see the Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise Features Guide at https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/customer-collaboration/unified-contact-center-enterprise/products-feature-guides-list.html
RONA for System PG
Redirection on No Answer calls update Peripheral tables (Peripheral_Real_Time and Peripheral_Interval) differently in Webex CCE environments than in Webex CCE deployments with the System PG.
Consider this example:
An incoming ACD call is sent to an agent, but the agent does not answer it. The RONA call redirects to an IVR (queued to a skill group), and is answered later by another agent.
In a Webex CCE deployment that does not use the System PG (with or without Unified CVP support), the CallsOffered fields (CallsOffered and CallsOfferedToday in Peripheral_Interval and Peripheral_Real_Time) are updated twice:
When the call first arrives, the Peripheral CallsOffered metrics for the CallManager peripheral are incremented.
When the call is sent to the IVR, the metrics for the IVR peripheral are incremented.
In Webex CCE with a System PG deployment, this metric is updated only when the call first arrives.
This feature is implemented differently depending on whether you install Unified IP-IVR or Unified CVP as the VRU for your system.
RONA Metric Reports
For Webex CCE, Redirection on No Answer metrics are reported directly from the ACD.
