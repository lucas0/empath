The characteristics described on this page do not guarantee authenticity or legitimacy of procurement. While this page provides information that may help identify suspicious products, Cisco will need to analyze the product(s) to make an authenticity determination. Please contact Brand Protection if you have concerns that a product may be counterfeit.
The characteristics described on this page also do not validate whether a product has a valid software license. Cisco's EULA requires that, for the end user to have a valid license, the end user must have either (1) purchased the product through an Approved Source or (2) had the software on the Cisco product relicensed under the Cisco Software Transfer and Re-Licensing Policy unless an exception applies as described in the above-mentioned policy.
