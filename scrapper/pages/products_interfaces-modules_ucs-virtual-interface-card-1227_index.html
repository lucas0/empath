Data Sheet
Superior Flexibility and Network Performance
The Cisco UCS Virtual Interface Card 1227 offers a modular LAN on Motherboard (mLOM) adapter. The mLOM slot, new to Cisco rack servers, can be used to install a Cisco VIC without consuming a PCIe slot. This provides greater I/O expandability.
Features and Capabilities
A Cisco innovation, the Cisco UCS Virtual Interface Card (VIC) 1227 is a dual-port, Enhanced Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP+), 10 Gigabit Ethernet and Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE)-capable, PCI Express (PCIe) modular LAN on motherboard (mLOM) adapter. It is designed exclusively for the M4 generation of Cisco UCS C-Series Rack Servers and the C3160 dense storage servers.
Designed for Flexibility
The capability to define, create, and use interfaces on demand provides a stateless and agile server infrastructure. The personality of the VIC 1227 is determined dynamically at boot time using the service profile associated with the server. The service profile is used to determine the number of PCIe interfaces, type (vNIC or vHBA), identity (MAC address) and World Wide Name (WWN), failover policy, bandwidth, and quality-of-service (QoS) policies.
Cisco Data Center Virtual Machine Fabric Extender (VM-FEX)
The Cisco UCS VIC 1227 implements VM-FEX, which unifies virtual and physical networking into a single infrastructure. They provide virtual-machine visibility from the physical network and consistent network operations model for physical and virtual servers.
Cisco User-Space NIC (usNIC)
The usNIC feature improves the performance of software applications using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) instead of sockets or other communication APIs. It does this through bypassing the kernel when sending and receiving networking packets. The applications interact directly with a Cisco VIC, which improves the networking performance of your high-performance computing application.
Simplify Data Center Cabling
Cisco SingleConnect technology unifies LAN, SAN, and systems management.

Specifications at a Glance
Feature Benefit
x8 PCIe Gen2 interfaces Delivers greater throughput
2 x 10-Gbps unified I/O
Delivers 20 Gbps to the server
Helps reduce TCO by consolidating the overall number of NICs, HBAs, cables, and switches
Up to 256 dynamic virtual adapters and interfaces
Creates fully functional, independent PCIe adapters and interfaces (NICs or HBAs) without requiring single-root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) support from OSs or hypervisors
Creates a highly flexible I/O environment needing only one card for all I/O configurations
Note: Cisco UCS VIC 1227 hardware is SR-IOV capable, and you can use SR-IOV after SR-IOV is broadly supported by the popular operating systems.
Advanced features support NetQueue
N-port ID virtualization
Receives flow steering, segment coalescing, and side scaling
SCVMM, SRIOV, and usNIC
Virtual Machine Fabric Extender, VM DirectPath, and VMQ
