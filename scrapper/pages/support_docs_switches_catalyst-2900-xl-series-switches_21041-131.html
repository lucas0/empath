Introduction
This document provides sample configurations on IEEE 802.1Q trunking and EtherChannel between a Catalyst 3524XL and Catalyst 2950 switch. The results of each command are displayed as they are executed. Any of the Catalyst Layer 2 fixed configuration switches, which include the 2900XL/3500XL, 2940, 2950/2955 and 2970, can be used in the scenarios presented in this document to obtain the same results.

Prerequisites
In this document, four Fast Ethernet ports from each of the switches have been set up as an 802.1Q trunk and bundled into a Fast EtherChannel (FEC).
Components Used
To create the examples in this document, we used the following switches in a lab environment with cleared configurations:
Catalyst 3524XL switch running Cisco IOSÂ® Software Release 12.0(5.2)XU
Catalyst 2950 switch running Cisco IOS Software Release 12.1(6)EA2a
Background Theory
There are no requirements to use contiguous ports to form a FEC on these switches.
With a Catalyst 2900XL running Cisco IOS Software Releases 11.2(8)SA1 or 11.2(8)SA2, you are allowed four FECs (port groups) per switch with an unlimited number of ports per group. Load balancing across the links in the channel is always based on the destination MAC address. All ports that are members of the same portchannel must be configured identically. They need to carry the same set of VLANs, and all must have trunk or non-trunk as the operational trunk status. Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN) and port security features are not supported.
On a Catalyst 2900XL running Cisco IOS Software Release 11.2(8)SA3 or later, a Catalyst 3500XL running Cisco IOS Software Release 11.2(8)SA6 or later, and a Catalyst 2950/2955, load balancing across the links in the channel is configurable to be based on source or destination MAC address, with source being the default. Source-based forwarding allows up to eight ports in a FEC (port group). Destination-based forwarding allows unlimited ports per port group. You can configure up to 12 FEC port groups per switch, and can have a mix of source/destination-based groups. All ports that are members of the same portchannel must be configured identically. They need to carry the same set of VLANs, and all must have trunk or non-trunk as the operational trunk status. SPAN and port security are not supported.
Catalyst 2940 and 2950/2955 switches only support 802.1Q trunking and do not support Inter-Switch Link Protocol (ISL) trunking. Catalyst 2970 supports both 802.1Q and ISL trunking protocols.
Configure
Dynamic Trunk Protocol
There are methods for creating trunks. If a port can become a trunk, it may also have the ability to trunk automatically, and in some cases even negotiate what type of trunking to use on the port. This ability to negotiate the trunking method with the other device is called Dynamic Trunk Protocol (DTP).
Note: Catalyst 2900XL/3500XL switches do not support DTP. Catalyst 2950/2955 switches support DTP for dynamic trunking with Cisco IOS Software Release 12.1(6)EA2 or later. Catalyst 2940 and 2970 support DTP in all Cisco IOS Software releases.
Port Aggregation Protocol
Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) aids in the automatic creation of FECl links. PAgP packets are sent between FECl-capable ports in order to negotiate the forming of a channel. Some restrictions have been deliberately introduced into PAgP. The restrictions are as follows:
PAgP will not form a bundle on ports that are configured for dynamic VLANs. PAgP requires that all ports in the channel belong to the same VLAN or are configured as trunk ports. When a bundle already exists and a VLAN of a port is modified, all ports in the bundle are modified to match that VLAN.
PAgP does not group ports that operate at different speeds or port duplex. If speed and duplex are changed when a bundle exists, PAgP changes the port speed and duplex for all ports in the bundle.
PAgP modes are off, auto, desirable, and on. Only the combinations auto-desirable, desirable-desirable, and on-on will allow a channel to be formed.
The PAgP modes are explained below.
on: PAgP will not run. The channel is forced to come up.
off: PAgP will not run. The channel is forced to remain down.
auto: PAgP is running passively. The formation of a channel is desired; however, it is not initiated.
desirable: PAgP is running actively. The formation of a channel is desired and initiated.
Only the combinations of auto-desirable, desirable-desirable, and on-on will allow a channel to be formed. If a device on one side of the channel does not support PAgP, such as a router, the device on the other side must have PAgP set to on.
Note: Catalyst 2900XL/3500XL switches do not support PAgP. Catalyst 2950/2955 switches support PagP for channel negotiation with Cisco IOS Software Release 12.1(6)EA2 or later; Cisco IOS Software Release 12.0 supports only static configuration. Catalyst 2940 and 2970 support PAgP in all Cisco IOS Software releases.
Link Aggregate Control Protocol (LACP)
Link Aggregate Control Protocol (LACP) trunking supports four modes of operation:
On: The link aggregation is forced to be formed without any LACP negotiation .In other words, the switch neither sends the LACP packet nor processes any inbound LACP packet. This is similar to the on state for PAgP.
Off: The link aggregation is not formed. We do not send or understand the LACP packet. This is similar to the off state for PAgP.
Passive: The switch does not initiate the channel but does understand inbound LACP packets. The peer (in active state) initiates negotiation (when it sends out an LACP packet) which we receive and answer, eventually to form the aggregation channel with the peer. This is similar to the auto mode in PAgP.
Active: We can form an aggregate link and initiate the negotiation. The link aggregate is formed if the other end runs in LACP active or passive mode. This is similar to the desirable mode of PAgP.
Note: By default, when an LACP channel is configured, the LACP channel mode is passive.
Note: Catalyst 2900XL/3500XL switches do not support LACP. Catalyst 2950/2955 switches support LACP for channel negotiation with Cisco IOS Software Release 12.1(6)EA2 or later. Cisco IOS Software Release 12.0 supports only static configuration. Catalyst 2940 and 2970 support LACP in all Cisco IOS Software releases.
