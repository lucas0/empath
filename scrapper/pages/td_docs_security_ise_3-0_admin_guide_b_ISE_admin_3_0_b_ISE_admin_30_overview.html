Introduction to Cisco ISE
Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) is an identity-based network access control and policy enforcement system. It functions as a common policy engine that enables endpoint access control and network device administration for enterprises.
You can leverage Cisco ISE to ensure compliance, enhance infrastructure security, and streamline service operations.
A Cisco ISE administrator can gather real-time contextual data for a network, including users and user groups (who?), device type (what?), access time (when?), access location (where?), access type (wired, wireless, or VPN) (how?), and network threats and vulnerabilities.
As a Cisco ISE administrator, you can use this information to make network governance decisions. You can also tie identity data to various network elements to create policies that govern network access and usage.
Cisco ISE Features
Cisco ISE software must be installed as is. You cannot install any other third-party applications at the underlying operating system level.
Cisco ISE empowers you with the following capabilities:
Device Administration: Cisco ISE uses the TACACS+ security protocol to control and audit the configuration of network devices. It facilitates granular control of who can access which network device and change the associated network settings. Network devices can be configured to query Cisco ISE for authentication and authorization of device administrator actions. These devices also send accounting messages to Cisco ISE to log such actions.
Guest and Secure Wireless: Cisco ISE enables you to provide secure network access to visitors, contractors, consultants, and customers. You can use web-based and mobile portals to on-board guests to your company’s network and internal resources. You can define access privileges for different types of guests, and assign sponsors to create and manage guest accounts.
Bring Your Own Device (BYOD): Cisco ISE allows your employees and guests to securely use their personal devices on your enterprise network. BYOD feature end users can use configured pathways to add their devices, and provision predefined authentications and levels of network access.
Asset Visibility: Cisco ISE gives you visibility and control over who and what is on your network consistently, across wireless, wired, and VPN connections. Cisco ISE uses probes and device sensors to listen to the way devices connect to the network. The Cisco ISE profile database, which is extensive, then classifies the device. This gives the visibility and context you need to grant the right level of network access.
Secure Access: Cisco ISE uses a wide range of authentication protocols to provide network devices and endpoints with a secure network access. These include, but are not limited to, 802.1X, RADIUS, MAB, web-based, EasyConnect, and external agent-enabled authentication methods.
Segmentation: Cisco ISE uses contextual data about network devices and endpoints to facilitate network segmentation. Security group tags, access control lists, network access protocols, and policy sets that define authorization, access, and authentication, are some ways in which Cisco ISE enables secure network segmentation.
Posture or Compliance: Cisco ISE allows you to check for compliance, also known as posture, of endpoints, before allowing them to connect to your network. You can ensure that endpoints receive the appropriate posture agents for posturing services.
Threat Containment: If Cisco ISE detects threat or vulnerability attributes from an endpoint, adaptive network control policies are sent to dynamically change the access levels of the endpoint. After the threat or vulnerability is evaluated and addressed, the endpoint is given back its original access policy.
Security Ecosystem Integrations: The pxGrid feature allows Cisco ISE to securely share context-sensitive information, policy and configuration data, and so on, with connected network devices, third-party vendors, or Cisco partner systems.
Cisco ISE Administrators
Administrators can use the admin portal to:
Manage deployments, help desk operations, and network devices, and node monitoring and troubleshooting.
Manage Cisco ISE services, policies, administrator accounts, and system configuration and operations.
Change administrator and user passwords.
A CLI administrator can start and stop the Cisco ISE application, apply software patches and upgrades, reload or shut down the Cisco ISE appliance, and view all the system and application logs. Because of the special privileges that are granted to a CLI administrator, we recommend that you protect the CLI administrator credentials and create web-based administrators for configuring and managing Cisco ISE deployments.
The username and password that you configure during setup is intended only for administrative access to the CLI. This role is considered to be the CLI admin user, also known as CLI administrator. By default, the username for a CLI admin user is admin, and the password is defined during setup. There is no default password. This CLI admin user is the default admin user, and this user account cannot be deleted. However, other administrators can edit it, including options to enable, disable, or change password for the corresponding account.
You can either create an administrator, or promote an existing user to an administrator role. Administrators can also be demoted to simple network user status by disabling the corresponding administrative privileges.
Administrators are users who have local privileges to configure and operate the Cisco ISE system.
Administrators are assigned to one or more admin groups.

Note
From Cisco ISE Release 2.7, use alphanumeric values while creating user accounts in Cisco ISE.

Force CLI Administrator to Use External Identity Store
Authentication with an external identity source is more secure than using the internal database. Role-based access control (RBAC) for CLI administrators supports an external identity store.

Note
You must have defined Admin users, and added them to an Administrator group. The Admin must be a Super Admin.
Define a User’s Attributes in the Active Directory User Directory
Using the Windows server running Active Directory, modify the attributes for each user that you plan to configure as a CLI Administrator.
From the Server Manager window, choose Server Manager > Roles > Active Directory Domain Services > Active Directory Users and Computers > [ ad.adserver ] <ad_server>.local.
Enable Advanced Features under the View menu so that you can edit a user’s attributes.
Navigate to the Active Directory group that contains a list of all the admin users and select a user.
Double-click the corresponding user ID.
The Properties window is displayed.
Click the Attribute Editor.
Click any attribute and start entering gid to locate the gidNumber. If you don't find the gidNumber attribute, click the Filter button and uncheck the Show only attributes that have values check box.
Double-click an attribute name to edit each attribute. For each user:
Assign a uidNumber greater than 60000, and make sure that the number is unique. Do not change the uidNumber after assignment.
Assign gidNumber as 110 or 111. While 110 denotes an admin user, whereas 111 denotes a read-only user. If you modify the gidNumber, wait for at least five minutes before making an SSH connection.
Join the Admin CLI User to the Active Directory Domain
Connect to the Cisco ISE CLI, run the identity-store command, and assign the Admin user to the ID store. For example, to map the CLI admin user to the Active Directory defined in ISE as adpool1, run the identity-store active-directory domain-name adpool1 user admincliuser command.
After the join is complete, connect to the Cisco ISE CLI and log in as the Admin CLI user to verify your configuration.
If the domain you use in this command was previously joined to the ISE node, you must rejoin the domain in the Administrators console.
In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > Identity Management > External Identity Sources.
In the left-hand pane, click Active Directory and select your Active Directory name.

Note
If you test the connection, with the test user using either MS-RPC or Kerberos, the status for your Active Directory connection might show Operational, but error messages are displayed.
Verify that you can still log in to the Cisco ISE CLI as the Admin CLI user.
Create a New Administrator
Cisco ISE administrators need accounts with specific roles assigned to them in order to perform specific administrative tasks. You can create multiple administrator accounts and assign one or more roles to these admins based on the administrative tasks that these admins have to perform.
Use the Admin Users window to view, create, modify, delete, change the status, duplicate, or search for attributes of Cisco ISE administrators.

Note
We recommend that you configure Active Directory access in the CLI before you join it in the GUI if the admin user's domain is the same in both the CLI and the GUI. Else, you must rejoin the domain from the GUI to avoid authentication failures to that domain.
Procedure
Step 1
In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > System > Admin Access > Administrators > Admin Users > Add.
Step 2
From the Add drop-down list, choose one of the following options:
Create an Admin User
If you choose Create an Admin User, a New Administrator window appears, from where you can configure account information for the new admin user.
Select from Network Access Users
If you choose Select from Network Access Users, a list of current users appears, from which you can choose a user. Subsequently, the Admin User window corresponding to this user appears.
Step 3
Enter values in the fields. The characters supported for the Name field are # $ ’ ( ) * + - . / @ _.
The admin user name must be unique. If you have entered an existing user name, an error pop-up window displays the following message:
User can't be created. A User with that name already exists.
Step 4
Click Submit to create a new administrator in the Cisco ISE internal database.

Cisco ISE Administrator Groups
Administrator groups are role-based access control (RBAC) groups in Cisco ISE. All the administrators who belong to the same group share a common identity and have the same privileges. An administrator’s identity as a member of a specific administrative group can be used as a condition in authorization policies. An administrator can belong to more than one administrator group.
An administrator account with any level of access can be used to modify or delete the objects for which it has permission, on any window it has access to.
The Cisco ISE security model limits administrators to create administrative groups that contain the same set of privileges that the administrator has. The privileges given are based on the administrative role of the user, as defined in the Cisco ISE database. Thus, administrative groups form the basis for defining privileges to access the Cisco ISE systems.
The following table lists the admin groups that are predefined in Cisco ISE, and the tasks that members from these groups can perform.

Cisco ISE Administrators
Create an Admin Group
The Admin Groups window allows you to view, create, modify, delete, duplicate, or filter Cisco ISE network admin groups.
Before you begin
To configure an external administrator group type, you must have already specified one or more external identity stores.
Procedure
Step 1
In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > System > Admin Access > Administrators > Admin Groups
Step 2
Click Add, and enter a name and description.
The supported special characters for the Name field are: space, # $ & ‘ ( ) * + - . / @ _ .
Step 3
Check the corresponding check box to specify the Type of administrator group you are configuring:
Internal: Administrators assigned to this group type authenticate against the credentials that are stored in the Cisco ISE internal database.
External: Administrators assigned to this group authenticate against the credentials stored in the external identity store that you select in the Administration > System > Admin Access > Authentication > Authentication Method window. You can specify the external groups, if required.
Note
  If an internal user is configured with an external identity store for authentication, while logging in to the ISE Admin portal, the internal user must select the external identity store as the Identity Source. Authentication will fail if Internal Identity Source is selected.
Step 4
Click Add in the Member Users area to add users to this admin group. To delete users from the admin group, check the check box corresponding to the user that you want to delete, and click Remove.
Step 5
Click Submit.
Administrative Access to Cisco ISE
Cisco ISE administrators can perform various administrative tasks based on the administrative group to which they belong. These administrative tasks are critical. Grant administrative access only to users who are authorized to administer Cisco ISE in your network.

Note
When a Cisco ISE server is added to a network, it is marked to be in Running state after its web interface comes up. However, it might take some more time for all the services to be fully operational because some advanced services, such as posture services, might take longer to be available.
Administrative Access Methods
You can connect to the Cisco ISE servers in several ways. The policy administration node (PAN) runs the Administrators portal. An admin password is required to log in. Other ISE persona servers are accessible through SSH or the console, from where you run the CLI. This section describes the process and password options available for each connection type:
Admin password: The Cisco ISE Admin user that you created during installation, times out in 45 days by default. You can prevent that by turning off Password Lifetime from Administration > System > Admin Settings. Click the Password Policy tab, and uncheck theAdministrative passwords expire check box under Password Lifetime.
If you do not do this, and the password expires, you can reset the admin password in the CLI by running the application reset-passwd command. You can reset the admin password by connecting to the console to access the CLI, or by rebooting the ISE image file to access the boot options menu.
CLI password: You must enter a CLI password during installation. If you have a problem logging in to the CLI because of an invalid password, you can reset the CLI password. Connect to the console and run the password CLI command to rest the password. See the Cisco Identity Services Engine CLI Reference Guide for more information.
SSH access to the CLI: You can enable SSH access either during installation or after, using the service sshd command. You can also force SSH connections to use a key. Note that when you do this, SSH connections to all the network devices also use that key. For more information, see the SSH Key Validation section in Cisco ISE Admin Guide: Segmentation. You can force the SSH key to use the Diffie-Hellman algorithm. Note that ECDSA keys are not supported for SSH keys.
Role-Based Admin Access Control in Cisco ISE
Role-Based Admin Access Control in Cisco ISE
Cisco ISE provides role-based access control (RBAC) policies that ensure security by restricting administrative privileges. RBAC policies are associated with default admin groups to define roles and permissions. A standard set of permissions (for menu as well as data access) is paired with each of the predefined admin groups, and is thereby aligned with the associated role and job function.
Some features in the user interface require certain permissions for their use. If a feature is unavailable, or you are not allowed to perform a specific task, your admin group may not have the necessary permissions to perform the task that utilizes the feature.
Regardless of the level of access, any administrator account can modify or delete objects for which it has permission, on any window that it can access.

Note
Only system-defined admin users with Super Admin or Read Only Admin permissions can see the identity-based users who are not a part of a user group. Admins you create without these permissions cannot see these users.

Role-Based Permissions
Cisco ISE allows you to configure permissions at the menu and data levels. These are called menu access and data access permissions.
The menu access permissions allow you to show or hide the menu and submenu items of the Cisco ISE administrative interface. This feature lets you create permissions so that you can restrict or enable access at the menu level.
The data access permissions allow you to grant read and write, read only, or no access to the Admin Groups, User Identity Groups, Endpoint Identity Groups, Locations, and Device Types data in the Cisco ISE interface.
RBAC Policies
RBAC policies determine if an administrator can be granted a specific type of access to a menu item or other identity group data elements. You can grant or deny access to a menu item or identity group data element to an administrator based on the admin group, by using RBAC policies. When administrators log in to the Admin portal, they can access menus and data that are based on the policies and permissions defined for the admin groups with which they are associated.
RBAC policies map admin groups to menu access and data access permissions. For example, you can prevent a network administrator from viewing the Admin Access operations menu and the policy data elements. This can be achieved by creating a custom RBAC policy for the admin group with which that network administrator is associated.

Note
If you are using customized RBAC policies for admin access, ensure that you provide all the relevant menu access for a given data access. For example, to add or delete endpoints with data access of Identity or Policy Admin, you must provide menu access to Work Center > Network Access and Administration > Identity Management.
Default Menu Access Permissions
Cisco ISE provides an out-of-the-box set of permissions that are associated with a set of predefined admin groups. Having predefined admin group permissions allow you to set permissions so that a member of any admin group can have full or limited access to the menu items within the administrative interface (known as menu access) and to delegate an admin group to use the data access elements of other admin groups (known as data access). These permissions are reusable entities that can be further used to formulate RBAC policies for various admin groups. Cisco ISE provides a set of system-defined menu access permissions that are already used in the default RBAC policies. Apart from the predefined menu access permissions, Cisco ISE also allows you to create custom menu access permissions that you can use in RBAC policies. The key icon represents menu access privileges for the menus and submenus, and the key with a close icon represents no access for different RBAC groups.

Note
For a Super Admin user, all the menu items are available. For other admin users, all the menu items in the Menu Access Privileges column are available for standalone deployment, and primary node in a distributed deployment. For secondary nodes in a distributed deployment, the menu items under the Administration tab are not available.

Configure Menu Access Permissions
Cisco ISE allows you to create custom menu access permissions that you can map to an RBAC policy. Depending on the role of the administrators, you can allow them to access only specific menu options.
Procedure
Step 1
In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > System > Admin Access > Authorization > Permissions > Menu Access
Step 2
Click Add, and enter values for the Name and Description fields.
Expand the ISE Navigation Structure menu to the required level, and click the options for which you want to create permissions.
In the Permissions for Menu Access pane, click Show.
Step 3
Click Submit.
Prerequisites for Granting Data Access Permissions
When an RBAC admin has Full Access permission to an object (for example, Employee in the User Identity Groups data type), the admin can view, add, update, and delete users who belong to that group. Ensure that the admin has menu access permission granted for the Users window (Administration > Identity Management > Identities > Users). This is applicable for network devices and endpoint objects (based on the permissions granted to the Network Device Groups and Endpoint Identity Groups data types).
You cannot enable or restrict data access for network devices that belong to the default network device group objects—All Device Types and All Locations. All the network devices are displayed if Full Access data permission is granted to an object created under these default network device group objects. Therefore, we recommend that you create a separate hierarchy for the Network Device Groups data type, which is independent of the default network device group objects. You should assign the network device objects to the newly created network devices groups to create restricted access.

Note
You can enable or restrict data access permissions only for the User Identity Groups, Network Device Groups, and Endpoint Identity Groups, but not to Admin Groups.
Default Data Access Permissions
Cisco ISE comes with a set of predefined data access permissions. These permissions enable multiple administrators to have the data access permissions within the same user population. You can enable or restrict the use of data access permissions to one or more admin groups. This process allows autonomous delegated control to administrators of one admin group to reuse data access permissions of the chosen admin groups through selective association. Data access permissions range from full access to no access for viewing selected admin groups or network device groups. RBAC policies are defined based on the administrator (RBAC) group, menu access, and data access permissions. You should first create menu access and data access permissions and then create an RBAC policy that associates an admin group with the corresponding menu access and data access permissions. The RBAC policy takes the form: If admin_group=Super Admin then assign SuperAdmin Menu Access permission + SuperAdmin Data Access permission. Apart from the predefined data access permissions, Cisco ISE also allows you to create custom data access permissions that you can associate with an RBAC policy.
There are three data access permissions, namely, Full Access, No Access, and Read Only access that can be granted to admin groups.
The Read Only permission can be granted to the following admin groups:
Administration > Admin Access > Administrators > Admin Groups
Administration > Groups > User Identity Group
Administration > Groups > Endpoint Identity Groups
Network Visibility > Endpoints
Administration > Network Resources > Network Device Groups
Administration > Network Resources > Network Devices
Administration > Identity Management > Identities
Administration > Identity Management > Groups > User Identity Groups
Administration > Identity Management > Groups > Endpoint Identity Groups
If you have read-only permission for a data type (for example, Endpoint Identity Groups), you will not be able to perform CRUD operations on that data type. If you have read-only permission for an object (for example, GuestEndpoints), you cannot perform edit or delete operations on that object.
The following image shows how data access privileges are applied at the second-level or third-level menu that contains additional submenus or options for different RBAC groups.
Figure 1. Data Access Privileges


Label
Description
1
Denotes full access for the User Identity Groups data type.
2
Denotes that Endpoint Identity Groups derive the maximum permission (full access) that is granted to its child (Asia, in the example shown in the figure).
3
Denotes that there is no access for the object (blocked list).
4
Denotes that the parent (Continents) derives the maximum access permission granted to its child (Asia).
5
Denotes read-only access for the object (Australia).
6
Denotes that when full access is granted to the parent (Network Device Groups), it results in the children automatically inheriting permissions.
7
Denotes that when full access is granted to the parent (Asia), it results in the objects inheriting the Full Access permission, unless permissions are explicitly granted to the objects.
The following table shows the default data access permissions for different admin groups.
√: Denotes that a user has full access
x: Denotes that a user has no access
!: Denotes that a user has read-only access

Configure Data Access Permissions
Cisco ISE allows you to create custom data access permissions that you can map to an RBAC policy. Based on the role of the administrator, you can choose to provide access to only select data.
Procedure
Step 1
In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > System > Admin Access > Authorization > Permissions
Step 2
Choose Permissions > Data Access.
Step 3
Click Add, and enter values for the Name and Description fields.
Click to expand the admin group and select the corresponding admin group.
Click Full Access, Read Only Access, or No Access.
Step 4
Click Save.
Read-Only Admin Policy
The default Read-Only Admin policy is available in the Administration > System > Admin Access > Authorization > RBAC Policy window. This policy is available for both new installations and upgraded deployments. The Read-Only Admin policy is applicable to the Read-Only Admin group. By default, Super Admin Menu Access and Read-Only Data Access permissions are granted to Read-Only administrators. This policy cannot be duplicated and the associated Data Access permission cannot be edited.

Note
The default read-only policy is mapped to the Read Only Admin group. You cannot create custom RBAC policy using the Read Only Admin group.
Cisco ISE supports the read-only functionality based on the static check of Read-Only Admin Group only.
Customize Menu Access for the Read-Only Administrator
By default, Read-Only Administrators are given Super Admin Menu Access and Read Only Admin Data Access. However, if the Super Admin requires that the Read-Only Administrator view only the Home and Administration tabs, the Super Admin can create a custom menu access or customize the default Permissions to, for example, MnT Admin Menu Access or Policy Admin Menu Access. The Super Admin cannot modify the Read Only Data Access mapped to the Read Only Admin Policy.
Procedure
Step 1
Log in to the Admin portal as a Super Admin.
Step 2
In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > System > Admin Access > Authorization > Permissions > Menu Access
Step 3
Click Add and enter a Name (for example, MyMenu) and Description.
Step 4
In the Menu Access Privileges section, you can enable the Show or Hide option to choose the required options (for example, Home and Administration tabs) that should be displayed for the Read-Only Administrator.
Step 5
Click Submit.
The custom menu access permission is displayed in the Permissions drop-down list corresponding to the Read-Only Admin Policy displayed in the Administration > System > Admin Access > Authorization > Policy window.
Step 6
Choose Administration > System > Admin Access > Authorization > RBAC Policy window.
Step 7
Click the Permissions drop-down list corresponding to the Read-Only Admin Policy and choose a default (MnT Admin Menu Access) or custom menu access permission (MyMenu) that you have created in the Administration > System > Admin Access > Authorization > Permissions > Menu Access window.
Step 8
Click Save.
Note
  You will encounter an error if you choose Data Access permissions for the Read-Only Admin policy.
When you log in to the Read-Only Admin portal, a Read-Only icon appears at the top of the window, and you can view only the specified menu options without data access.
