Product Overview
The Cisco ® RF Gateway 10 defines a new category in cable network infrastructure - a highly intelligent, multifunction, carrier-class universal edge quadrature amplitude modulation modulator (U-EQAM) platform designed for high-availability services. The gateway offers concurrent support for standard and high definition digital broadcast television, switched digital video (SDV), video-on-demand (VoD), and DOCSIS ® modular cable modem termination system (M-CMTS ™) services. The chassis has twenty six interface slots to accommodate:
• Dual supervisor and Ethernet switching line cards
• 1:N universal edge QAM line cards
• Dual timing and control line cards
• Dual load balancing and load sharing power supplies
• Integrated RF switching modules
All of the applications supported on the platform are based on open standards and together provide new levels of performance, capacity, power consumption, ease of management, and scalability.
The Cisco RF Gateway 10, Figure 1, is part of the Cisco Cable Ecosystem and has been fully integrated and tested as part of the Cisco Digital Broadband Delivery System (DBDS) video solution, Cisco uBR10012 DOCSIS 3.0, and M-CMTS solution.

Applications
• Broadcast video
• SDV
• VoD
• Standard and high definition digital video
• DOCSIS 3.0 and M-CMTS
Features and Benefits
As cable operators expand their offerings of high definition services and accelerate the transition to a fully digital network through initiatives such as DOCSIS 3.0, SDV and analog reclamation, the number of QAM channels required is expected to grow exponentially. The Cisco RF Gateway 10 provides the capacity, scalability and high-availability features to enable this transition.
Key features of the Cisco RF Gateway 10 include:
• Up to 480 QAM channels per chassis with the Cisco RF Gateway 10 DS-48 universal edge QAM line card and the ability to grow to thousands of QAM channels per chassis with future QAM line cards
• Redundancy of all system components with RF Gateway 10 DS-48 universal edge QAM line card subsecond failover
• 100 percent link redundancy with 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10GE) and Gigabit Ethernet (GE) interfaces
• Universal edge QAM functionality to support all digital video and DOCSIS services concurrently on a single platform
• Non-service-affecting roadmap of incremental upgrades, including scalability to 200+ Gbps aggregate bandwidth per chassis
The primary features and benefits of the Cisco RF Gateway 10 are described in Table 1.

Product Architecture
The Cisco RF Gateway 10 is a member of the Cisco RF Gateway product series and is designed to meet the most demanding requirements of cable operators worldwide. It is optimized for operators wanting to provide carrier-class high-availability solutions while also collapsing video and data traffic over cable edge QAM functions into one common platform (Figure 2).
A collapsed universal edge QAM architecture achieves the following business benefits:
• Enhanced edge QAM resource utilization
• Cost efficiencies
• Optimized rack space
• Reduced cost and complexity of management
• Concurrent high availability for all services
Figure 2. Universal Edge QAM Solution High-Level Architecture
Designed for high availability, with the equivalent Ethernet and IP routing performance and features of a large-scale Cisco router, the Cisco RF Gateway 10 provides the industry's highest universal edge QAM line card RF fast failover performance. The gateway's modular and hot-swappable design provides unsurpassed reliability and high QAM capacity for highly efficient QAM sharing in a converged MPEG and IP environment. It also features very low power consumption per QAM channel and the flexibility to deliver next-generation services to medium-sized to large-sized hub sites.
The Cisco RF Gateway 10 provides ease of operations with a single point of management for the entire chassis and offers feature compatibility, similar look and feel, consistent graphical style user management interface, and common engineering and testing processes with the RF Gateway 1 small form factor universal edge QAM. With the Cisco RF Gateway 10, cable operators now have a choice of purchasing a carrier-class, high-availability, multifunctional gateway instead of multiple separate devices.
