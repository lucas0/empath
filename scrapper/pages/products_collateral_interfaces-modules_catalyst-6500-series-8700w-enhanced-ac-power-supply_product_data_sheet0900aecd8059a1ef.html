Product Overview
The 8700 Watt (W) enhanced AC power supply for Cisco ® Catalyst ® 6500 Series Switches (Figure 1) is a triple AC input power supply with remote restart capability. The 8700W enhanced AC power supply is designed for the 6-, 9-, and 13-slot Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switch chassis. A Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switch configured with the 8700W enhanced AC power supply will support up to 420 IEEE 802.3af Class 3 (15.4W) Power over Ethernet (PoE) devices with full redundancy in a single chassis, providing superior PoE scalability. A Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switch along with the 8700W enhanced AC power supply is PoE plus ready with ability to support up to 1750W of power per slot.
The 8700W enhanced AC power supply provides the ability to remotely power cycle or shut down Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches for maintenance using Normally Open (NO) or Normally Closed (NC) built-in external relay contacts using a front-panel terminal block interface. The power supply relay contacts can be controlled through any appropriate third-party relay controller.

Applications
The 8700W enhanced AC power supply allows a Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switch to be remotely power cycled or shut down even with no access to the console or CLI of the switch for maintenance using an appropriate third-party relay controller, as shown in Figure 2. This feature reduces the maintenance cost and improves mean-time-to-repair (MTTR).

Feature
Benefits
PoE scalability
Supports up to 420 IEEE 802.3af Class 3 (15.4W) PoE devices in a single chassis with full redundancy, thus reducing total cost of ownership for high-density PoE deployments in the campus access layer.
Remote power restart using external relay controller
Remotely power cycles or shuts down the Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switch using any appropriate third-party relay controller without needing access to the supervisor engine CLI, thereby reducing maintenance costs and improving MTTR.
Remote power restart using Cisco IOS® Software CLI
Remotely power cycle or shut down the Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switch using the Cisco IOS Software CLI, reducing maintenance costs and improving MTTR.
Multiple input
Remote power cycle scales the system power depending on the need (scale as you grow) with fully isolated inputs, providing flexibility.
Universal multiple (triple) input (110-220VAC, 50-60Hz)
Flexibility to provision circuits with either high-input voltage (200-220V) or low-input voltage (100-120V) depending on availability and power output needs.
Compatible with 6-, 9-, and 13-slot chassis
Investment protection: the 8700W enhanced AC power supply can be installed into existing Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switch chassis: both E- and non-E series Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switch chassis.
Note: Available power is limited to 4000W in Cisco Catalyst 6506 and 6509 Switches, 4500W in the Cisco Catalyst 6509-NEB-A Switch and 6000W in the Cisco Catalyst 6513 Switch. Full power available in the Cisco Catalyst 6506-E and 6509-E Switches.
Hot swappable
Eliminates downtime when replacing power supply.
Mixed power supply operation (along with lower capacity AC or DC power supply)
Eliminates downtime when upgrading to the new 8700W enhanced AC power supply.
Product Architecture
The 8700W enhanced AC power supply provides highest capacity AC power supply on Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches. Table 2 compares the AC power supply options on a Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switch.

A separate relay controller is needed to use the remote power restart and shutdown of the 8700WAC power supply. These relays can be purchased directly from any appropriate third-party vendors. Cisco has verified the proper operation of the remote power restart feature with relay controllers from Dataprobe Inc ( http://www.dataprobe.com).
