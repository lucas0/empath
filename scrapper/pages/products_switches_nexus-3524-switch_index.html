High Performance with Flexible Deployments
The Cisco Nexus 3524/3524-X Switch, part of the Unified Fabric Family, is well suited for mainstream top-of-rack (TOR) data center deployments. It offers wire-rate Layer 2 and Layer 3 switching with a comprehensive feature set, including Algo Boost technology, and ultra-low latency. All comes in a compact, cost effective, 1-rack-unit (1RU) form factor.
Features and Capabilities
Algo Boost technology allows the Cisco Nexus 3524/3524-X to achieve exceptionally low latencies of 250 nanoseconds (ns) or less for all workloads. That includes unicast and multicast, and Layer 2 and 3, regardless of the features applied.
Among other benefits:
Warp mode can further reduce latency to 190 ns for small-to-midsize Layer 2 and 3 deployments.
Warp SPAN helps enables stock market data delivery to trading servers in as little as 50 ns.
Active Buffer Monitoring helps you take advantage of market volatility and handle micro bursts.
Technology supports Network Address Translation (NAT) for trade execution on any venue, without a latency penalty.
Embedded Remote SPAN with nanosecond timestamps helps you monitor your traffic with unparalleled precision.
Multicast NAT and latency monitoring leading to simplified co-location integration and enhanced traffic visibility and troubleshooting (only 3524-X model).
Next generation 3524-X offers lower power consumption further lowering operational cost
