Objective
A digital certificate certifies the ownership of a public key by the named subject of the certificate. This allows relying parties to depend upon signatures or assertions made by the private key that corresponds to the public key that is certified. Upon installation, the FindIT Network Manager generates a self-signed certificate to secure web and other communication with the server. You can choose to replace this certificate with the one signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA). To do this, you will need to generate a certificate signing request (CSR) for signing by the CA.
You can also choose to generate a certificate and the corresponding private key completely independent of the Manager. If so, you can combine the certificate and private key into a Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #12 format file prior to upload.
The FindIT Network Manager only supports .pem format certificates. If you get other certificate formats, you need to convert the format or request for the .pem format certificate again from the CA.
This article provides instructions on how to manage certificates on FindIT Network Manager.
