Underlay Measurement and Tracing Services
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10.1a
Cisco SD-WAN Controllers Release 20.10.1
The underlay measurement and tracing services (UMTS) feature provides visibility into the exact paths that tunnels take between local and remote Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices, through the underlay network (the physical devices that comprise the network). For a specific tunnel, the path includes all the nodes between the two devices.
You can enable UMTS using Cisco vManage. You can view the resulting path information in Cisco vManage and in Cisco vAnalytics.

Information About Underlay Measurement and Tracing Services
UMTS provides visibility into the exact path that a tunnel takes between local and remote Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices, through the underlay network (the physical devices that comprise the network). For a specific tunnel, the path includes all the nodes between the two devices.
When a device creates an IPsec or GRE tunnel to a remote device, connecting through devices in the underlay network, more than one path may be possible from the local device to the remote device. The number of paths and the hops in the paths depend on the variability of the underlay network. The path that a tunnel takes through the underlay network can change over time. For example, if a tunnel uses a path that includes router A, and if router A becomes unavailable later, the tunnel will require a different path.
Each possible path through the underlay network is called a candidate path. The actual path that the tunnel is using at the moment is called the exact path. UMTS traces only the exact path. It does not discover or trace candidate paths.
The following illustration shows an underlay network that provides multiple paths for a tunnel between Device 1 and Device 2, and shows the exact path used by the tunnel.
Figure 1. Exact Path
You can trace the path of the tunnels in a network using one of these options:
Monitoring: Trace tunnel paths regularly according to a configured time interval.
Event-Driven: Trace tunnel paths when triggered by one of the following events:
A change in the service-level agreement (SLA) for the tunnel.
A change in the path maximum transmission unit for the tunnel.
On demand: Trace the path of tunnels on demand, and display the results in Cisco vManage. For information, see View Exact Paths On Demand.
Mechanism for Underlay Measurement and Tracing Services
For UMTS interval-based monitoring and event-driven monitoring, Cisco vManage provides monitoring configuration (interval, event types) as part of the overall device configuration. In accordance with the configuration, Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices use an UMTS probe packet mechanism to trace the exact paths of tunnels across all hops, and collect network metrics such as delay and loss. The devices send the resulting information to Cisco vManage, which in turn, sends it to Cisco vAnalytics. Cisco vAnalytics uses the information to graphically display the exact path of the tunnels in the network.
For the on-demand option, Cisco vManage sends a request to the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices in the network to probe the network and trace the exact paths of tunnels. This request is in the form of a NETCONF action, and not a device configuration. The devices use the UMTS probe packet mechanism to trace the exact paths of the tunnels across all the hops, and to collect network metrics such as delay and loss. The devices send the resulting information to Cisco vManage, and Cisco vManage graphically displays the exact path of the tunnels in the network.
Benefits of Underlay Measurement and Tracing Services
Benefits of Underlay Measurement and Tracing Services
UMTS provides details of the exact path of each Cisco SD-WAN tunnel, which can be useful in identifying problems with the tunnels.
Prerequisites for Underlay Measurement and Tracing Services
To view the exact path graphs in Cisco vAnalytics, you must enable application visibility and flow visibility.

Note
This prerequisite does not apply to on-demand viewing of graphs in Cisco vManage.
For more information about configuring application visibility and flow visibility, see Configure Global Application Visibility, Configure Global Flow Visibility.
Data Stream must be enabled in Cisco vManage (from the Cisco vManage menu, choose Administration > Settings) to trace the path of tunnels on demand and display the results in Cisco vManage.
Cisco vManage and Cisco vAnalytics must be integrated to view visualizations in Cisco vAnalytics. For more information about integrating Cisco vAnalytics with Cisco vManage, see Onboarding Cisco vAnalytics.
Restrictions for Underlay Measurement and Tracing Services
UMTS is supported only on Cisco SD-WAN tunnels using IPv4 addresses.
For the interval- and event-driven options, you can view the graphical representation of the exact paths only in Cisco vAnalytics. For the on-demand option, you can view the exact paths in Cisco vManage.
Cisco vAnalytics UMTS graphs cannot distinguish between monitoring records and SLA and path maximum transmission unit events.
Configure Underlay Measurement and Tracing Services
Configure UMTS Using Configuration Group
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Templates > Configuration Groups.
Click … adjacent to the configuration group name and choose Edit.
Click System Profile.
Click Add Feature.
From the Type drop-down list, choose Performance Monitoring.
In the Feature Name field, enter a name for the feature.
In the Description field, enter a description for the feature.
Click Underlay Measurement Track Service.
To trace the tunnel paths regularly, based on a time interval, do the following:
From the Monitoring drop-down list, choose Global.
Click the toggle button to enable the continuous monitoring option in UMTS.
In the Monitoring Interval (Minutes) drop-down list, choose a time.
This option enables you to monitor the exact path during a specific time period.
To trace tunnel paths when triggered by an event, do the following:
Click the Event Driven drop-down list, and choose Global.
Click the Event Type drop-down list, and choose one or more event types.
Click Save.
Click the Associated Devices tab.
From the list of Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices, choose one or more Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices, and then click Deploy.
In the Process Overview window, click Next.
The Selected Devices to Deploy window displays the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices selected previously.
Check or uncheck the check boxes adjacent to the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices and then click Next.
In the Summary window, click Deploy to deploy the configurations in the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.

Note
With the Monitor option enabled in Cisco vManage, time-series data for the exact path can be generated and displayed in Cisco vAnalytics.
For more information on using configuration groups, see Configuration Groups and Feature Profiles.
Configure Underlay Measurement and Tracing Services Using a CLI Template
Use the CLI templates to configure continuous monitoring and event types for exact paths. For more information about using CLI templates, see CLI Add-On Feature Templates and CLI Templates.

Note
By default, CLI templates execute commands in global config mode.
This procedure configures interval-based monitoring and event-driven UMTS monitoring of tunnel paths.
Monitor the exact paths of tunnels continually, with a specific time interval:
sdwan 
umts

Troubleshooting Underlay Measurement and Tracing Services
Zero IP Address
Timeout Error
Zero IP Address
Problem
Cisco vManage displays hops with a zero IP address (0.0.0.0) in the exact path.
Possible Causes
The intermediate hops in the public internet may not respond because Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) time exceeded messages are disabled or blocked by a firewall. In such cases, hops are shown with a zero IP address.
The destination edge device could be a Cisco vEdge device, which does not support UMTS.
Solution
Zero IP addresses in the exact path does not imply any functional problems with the tunnel. Verify that the zero IP address is because of one of the reasons described in Possible Causes section.
Timeout Error
Problem
A timeout error is displayed after starting an UMTS session, on demand, in Cisco vManage.
Possible Causes
You are not using the minimum required releases--Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10.1a or later for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices, and Cisco SD-WAN Controllers Release 20.10.1 or later.
There are network connectivity issues.
Solution
Check for the causes listed in Possible Causes section, and try the trace again.
