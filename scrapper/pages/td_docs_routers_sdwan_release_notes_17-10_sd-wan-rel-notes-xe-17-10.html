Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices with the SFP-10G-SR module do not support online insertion and removal (OIR) of this module.
Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1 implements a hardened security posture to comply with FedRamp guidelines. As a result, your vAnalytics login credentials that are stored locally get erased on upgrading the software, and you cannot access the vAnalytics service directly through Cisco vManage. In this case, log in to vAnalytics using this URL: https://analytics.viptela.com. If you can’t find your vAnalytics login credentials, open a case with Cisco TAC support.
Starting from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.5.1a, the table keyword is added to all show sdwan commands for which the output needs to be displayed in a tabular format. Using | tab is restricted for all Cisco SD-WAN commands starting from Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Release 16.11.x.
Starting from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.9.1a, feature templates support the following network interface modules for Layer 3 features:
Cisco 2-port 100-Mbps/1-Gbps WAN Network Interface Module with 256-bit WAN MACsec (C-NIM-2T)
Cisco 1-port 2.5-Gbps/1-Gbps WAN Network Interface Module with Cisco UPoE (C-NIM-1M)
Starting from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.9.1a, the Switch Port feature template supports an interface speed of 2500 Mbps when configuring a 2-Gigabit Ethernet interface for the following modules:
