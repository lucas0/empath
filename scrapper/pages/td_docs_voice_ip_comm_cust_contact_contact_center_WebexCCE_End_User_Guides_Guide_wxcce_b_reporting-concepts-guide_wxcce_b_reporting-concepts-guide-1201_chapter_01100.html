Chapter: Bucket Intervals for Cisco Unified Intelligence Center
Chapter Contents
Bucket Intervals
Bucket Intervals
Bucket intervals allow you to track data for calls abandoned or answered within specific time increments. For example, you can track data for calls abandoned or answered between 0 and 8 seconds, or under 60 seconds.
Bucket intervals are associated with the following:
Call types
Skill groups
Precision queues
You can set bucket intervals for the system as a whole and for individual call types, skill groups, and precision queues. Settings for individual entities override settings set at the system level.

Note
Currently the global setting is available only for call types.
Service level tells you what percentage of calls are being answered within a certain time, but does not tell you how closely to the service level calls are being answered or abandoned. Call type intervals provide more insight into how long callers are waiting before their calls are answered or before they abandon.
For example, if your service level is two minutes, you might want to set up intervals for 30 seconds, one minute, 90 seconds, 120 seconds, 180 seconds, 210 seconds, and 240 seconds. Using these intervals, you can see whether calls are being answered in the 30 seconds after the service level threshold of 180 seconds or if most are waiting a full minute longer to be answered.
The intervals also give you insight into how long callers are willing to wait before abandoning. Many callers do not abandon until two minutes past the service level. This might indicate that you can modify your service level goal.
To avoid inconsistencies in reporting, create a new Bucket Interval List with your desired parameters. Follow this updated Bucket Interval parameter for Call Types, Skill Groups or Precision Queues only at specific times (that is, end of the day, week, or month). Ensure that no one is running the reports for the intervals, while you modify the boundaries.
