Switch to Configuration Mode in EXEC Mode
In EXEC mode, you can enter into configuration mode by running the configure or configure terminal (conf t) command.
You cannot enter configuration commands directly in EXEC mode from the Cisco ISE CLI. Some of the configuration commands require you to enter the configuration submode to complete the command configuration.
To exit configuration mode, enter the exit , end , or Ctrl-z command.
Configuration commands include interface , Policy List , and repository .
You can perform configuration tasks in configuration mode. You must save your configuration changes so that you preserve them during a system reload or power outage.
When you save the configuration, these commands remain across Cisco ISE server reboots, but only if you run either of these commands:
copy running-config startup-config
write memory
Configuring Cisco ISE in the Configuration Mode
You can enter configuration and configuration submodes commands to change the actual configuration of the Cisco ISE server in configuration mode.
Procedure
Step 1
Enter configure terminal to enter into the configuration mode.
ise/admin# configure terminal
Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL-Z.
ise/admin(config)# (configuration mode)
Step 2
Enter a question mark (?) to obtain a listing of commands in the configuration mode.
ise/admin(config)# ?
Configure commands:
cdp               CDP Configuration parameters
clock             Configure timezone
conn-limit        Configure a TCP connection limit from source IP
do                EXEC command
end               Exit from configure mode
exit              Exit from configure mode
hostname          Configure hostname
icmp              Configure icmp echo requests
interface         Configure interface
ip                Configure IP features
kron              Configure command scheduler
logging           Configure system logging
max-ssh-sessions  Configure number of concurrent SSH sessions
no                Negate a command or set its defaults
ntp               Specify NTP configuration
password-policy   Password Policy Configuration
rate-limit        Configure a TCP/UDP/ICMP packet rate limit from source IP
repository        Configure Repository
service           Specify service to manage
snmp-server       Configure snmp server
synflood-limit    Configure a TCP SYN packet rate limit
username          User creation
Step 3
Enter into the configuration submode. The configuration mode has several configuration submodes. Each of these submodes places you deeper in the prompt hierarchy. From this level, you can enter commands directly into the Cisco ISE configuration.
ise/admin(config)# interface GigabitEthernet 0
ise/admin(config-GigabitEthernet)#
Step 4
Enter exit in sequence at the command prompt to exit both Configuration and EXEC modes. When you enter exit , Cisco ISE backs you out one level and returns you to the previous level. When you enter exit again, Cisco ISE backs you out to the EXEC level.
ise/admin(config)# exit
ise/admin# exit
Configuring Cisco ISE in the Configuration Submode
You can enter commands for specific configurations in the configuration submodes. You can use the exit or end command to exit this prompt and return to the configuration prompt.
Procedure
Step 1
Enter configure terminal to enter into the configuration mode.
ise/admin# configure terminal
Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL-Z.
ise/admin(config)# (configuration mode)
Step 2
Enter into the configuration submode.
ise/admin# configure terminal
ise/admin(config)# interface GigabitEthernet 0
ise/admin(config-GigabitEthernet)# ?
Configure ethernet interface:
  backup    Configure NIC bonding feature
  do        EXEC command

ise/admin(config-GigabitEthernet)#
Step 3
Enter exit at the command prompt to exit both configuration submode and configuration mode.
ise/admin(config-GigabitEthernet)# exit
ise/admin(config)# exit
ise/admin#
CLI Configuration Command Default Settings
CLI configuration commands can have a default form, which returns the command settings to the default values. Most commands disable by default, so in such cases using the default form has the same result as using the no form of the command.
However, some commands are enabled by default and have variables set to certain default values. In these cases, the default form of the command enables the command and sets the variables to their default values.
backup interface
To configure two Ethernet interfaces in to a single virtual interface for high availability (also called as the NIC bonding or NIC teaming feature), use the backup interface command in configuration submode. To remove the NIC bonding configuration, use the no form of this command. When two interfaces are bonded, the two NICs appear to be a single device with a single MAC address.
The NIC bonding feature in Cisco ISE does not support load balancing or link aggregation features. Cisco ISE supports only the high availability feature of NIC bonding.
The bonding of interfaces ensures that Cisco ISE services are not affected when there is:
Physical interface failure
Loss of switch port connectivity (shut or failure)
Switch line card failure
When two interfaces are bonded, one of the interfaces becomes the primary interface and the other becomes the backup interface. When two interfaces are bonded, all traffic normally flows through the primary interface. If the primary interface fails for some reason, the backup interface takes over and handles all the traffic. The bond takes the IP address and MAC address of the primary interface.
When you configure the NIC bonding feature, Cisco ISE pairs fixed physical NICs to form bonded NICs. The following table outlines which NICs can be bonded together to form a bonded interface.
Cisco ISE Physical NIC Name
Linux Physical NIC Name
Role in Bonded NIC
Bonded NIC Name
Gigabit Ethernet 0
Eth0
Primary
Bond 0
Gigabit Ethernet 1
Eth1
Backup
Gigabit Ethernet 2
Eth2
Primary
Bond 1
Gigabit Ethernet 3
Eth3
Backup
Gigabit Ethernet 4
Eth4

Backup
The NIC bonding feature is supported on all supported platforms and node personas. The supported platforms include:
SNS-3400 series appliances - Bond 0 and 1 (Cisco ISE 3400 series appliances support up to 4 NICs)
SNS-3500 series appliances - Bond 0, 1, and 2
VMware virtual machines - Bond 0, 1, and 2 (if six NICs are available to the virtual machine)
Linux KVM nodes - Bond 0, 1, and 2 (if six NICs are available to the virtual machine)
Syntax Description
backup interface
Configures the NIC bonding feature.
GigabitEthernet
Configures the Gigabit Ethernet interface specified as the backup interface.
0 - 3
Number of the Gigabit Ethernet port to configure as the backup interface.
Command Default
No default behavior or values.
Command Modes
Interface configuration submode (config-GigabitEthernet)#
Command History
Release
Modification
2.1.0.474
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
As Cisco ISE supports up to six Ethernet interfaces, it can have only three bonds, bond 0, bond 1, and bond 2.
You cannot change the interfaces that are part of a bond or change the role of the interface in a bond. Refer to the above table for information on which NICs can be bonded together and their role in the bond.
The Eth0 interface acts as both the management interface as well as the runtime interface. The other interfaces act as runtime interfaces.
Before you create a bond, the primary interface (primary NIC) must be assigned an IP address. The Eth0 interface must be assigned an IPv4 address before you create bond 0. Similarly, before you create bond 1 and 2, Eth2 and Eth4 interfaces must be assigned an IPv4 or IPv6 address, respectively.
Before you create a bond, if the backup interface (Eth1, Eth3, and Eth5 ) has an IP address assigned, remove the IP address from the backup interface. The backup interface should not be assigned an IP address.
You can choose to create only one bond (bond 0) and allow the rest of the interfaces to remain as is. In this case, bond 0 acts as the management interface and runtime interface, and the rest of the interfaces act as runtime interfaces.
You can change the IP address of the primary interface in a bond. The new IP address is assigned to the bonded interface because it assumes the IP address of the primary interface.
When you remove the bond between two interfaces, the IP address assigned to the bonded interface is assigned back to the primary interface.
If you want to configure the NIC bonding feature on a Cisco ISE node that is part of a deployment, you must deregister the node from the deployment, configure NIC bonding, and then register the node back to the deployment.
If a physical interface that acts as a primary interface in a bond (Eth0, Eth2, or Eth4 interface) has static route configured, the static routes are automatically updated to operate on the bonded interface instead of the physical interface.
Example 1 - Configure NIC Bonding
The following procedure explains how you can configure bond 0 between Eth0 and Eth1 interfaces.

Note
If a physical interface that acts as a backup interface (for example, Eth1, Eth3, Eth5 interfaces), is configured with an IP address, you must remove the IP address from the backup interface. The backup interface should not be assigned an IP address.
ise/admin# configure terminal  
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
ise/admin(config)# interface gigabitEthernet 0 
ise/admin(config-GigabitEthernet)# backup interface gigabitEthernet 1 
Changing backup interface configuration may cause ISE services to restart.

ise/admin(config-GigabitEthernet)#
Example 2 - Verify NIC Bonding Configuration
To verify if NIC bonding feature is configured, run the show running-config command from the Cisco ISE CLI. You will see an output similar to the following:
!        
interface GigabitEthernet 0
  ipv6 address autoconfig
  ipv6 enable
  backup interface GigabitEthernet 1
  ip address 192.168.118.214 255.255.255.0
!    
In the output above, "backup interface GigabitEthernet 1" indicates that NIC bonding is configured on Gigabit Ethernet 0, with Gigabit Ethernet 0 being the primary interface and Gigabit Ethernet 1 being the backup interface. Also, the ADE-OS configuration does not display an IP address on the backup interface in the running config, even though the primary and backup interfaces effectively have the same IP address.
You can also run the show interfaces command to see the bonded interfaces.
cdp holdtime
To specify the amount of time for which the receiving device should hold a Cisco Discovery Protocol packet from the Cisco ISE server before discarding it, use the cdp holdtime command in configuration mode.
cdp holdtime seconds
To revert to the default setting, use the no form of this command.
no cdp holdtime
Syntax Description
holdtime
Specifies the Cisco Discovery Protocol hold time advertised.
seconds
Advertised hold time value, in seconds. The value ranges from 10 to 255 seconds.
Command Default
The default CDP holdtime, in seconds is 180.
Command Modes

This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
clear screen is a hidden command. Although clear screen is available in Cisco ISE, the CLI interactive Help does not display it if you attempt to view it by entering a question mark at the command line.
Example
The following example shows how to clear the contents of the terminal:
ise/admin(config)# clear screen
ise/admin#
clock timezone
To set the time zone, use the clock timezone command in configuration mode.
clock timezone timezone
To disable the time zone, use the no form of this command.
no clock timezone

Note
Changing the time zone on a Cisco ISE appliance after installation causes the Cisco ISE application on that node to be unusable, which requires you to restart ISE. We recommend that you use the preferred time zone (default UTC) during the installation when the initial setup wizard prompts you for the time zones.
Syntax Description
timezone
Configures system timezone.
timezone
Name of the time zone visible when in standard time. Supports up to 64 alphanumeric characters.
If you have the primary Administration node (PAN) auto-failover configuration enabled, disable it before you set the time zone. You can enable it after the time zone is set.
Command Default
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
Command Modes
Configuration (config)#
Command History
Release
Modification
2.0.0.306
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
The system internally keeps time in UTC. If you do not know your specific time zone, you can enter the region, country, and city (see Tables 4-1, 4-2, and 4-3 for common time zones and time zones for Australia and Asia to enter on your system).

Note
Several more time zones are available to you. Enter show timezones and a list of all time zones available appears in the Cisco ISE server. Choose the most appropriate one for your time zone.
If you have the PAN auto-failover configuration enabled in your deployment, the following message appears:
PAN Auto Failover is enabled, this operation is not
allowed! Please disable PAN Auto-failover first.
Example
ise/admin(config)# clock timezone EST
ise/admin(config)# exit
ise/admin# show timezone
EST
ise/admin#
Changing the Time Zone on Cisco ISE Nodes
Common Time Zones
Australia Time Zones
Asia Time Zones
Changing the Time Zone on Cisco ISE Nodes
Changing the time zone on a Cisco ISE appliance after installation causes the Cisco ISE application on that node to be unusable. However, the preferred time zone (default UTC) can be configured during the installation when the initial setup wizard prompts you for the time zones.
Changing time zone impacts different Cisco ISE nodes types of your deployment.
To recover from the impact, use the following steps:
Standalone or Primary Cisco ISE Node
To change the timezone after installation you must re-image the node.
Ensure that you have a backup of latest configuration, and export the necessary certificates and keys.
If you wish to change the time zone, do the following:
Re-image the Primary Cisco ISE node.
During the installation, select the appropriate timezone.
Restore backup and certificates.
Rejoin Active Directory and apply any per-node configurations for ISE profiling probes, LDAP,etc.
Secondary ISE Node
If you want to change the time zone on the secondary node to keep it to be the same as the primary node, do the following:
Export the necessary certificates.
Deregister the secondary node.
Re-image the node.
Import the necessary certificates, if required.
Re-register the node as a secondary node to the primary node.
Rejoin Active Directory and apply any per-node configurations for ISE profiling probes, LDAP,etc.

Note
If 'Ctrl-C' is issued during the CLI configuration change of 'hostname' command, the system might end up in a state where some application components might have the old hostname while some components might use the new hostname. This will bring the Cisco ISE node to a non-working state.
The workaround for this issue is to run the 'hostname' configuration command again to set the hostname to the desired value.
You can use the hostname command to change the current hostname. A single instance type of command, hostname only occurs once in the configuration of the system. The hostname must contain one argument; otherwise, an error occurs.
When you update the hostname of the Cisco ISE server with this command, the following warning message is displayed:
 % Warning:  Updating the hostname will cause any certificate using the old
%           hostname to become invalid. Therefore, a new self-signed
%           certificate using the new hostname will be generated now for
%           use with HTTPs/EAP.  If CA-signed certs were used on this node,
%           please import them with the correct hostname. In addition, 
%           if this ISE node will be joining a new
%           Active Directory domain, please leave your current Active
%           Directory domain before proceeding. If this ISE node is already
%           joined to an Active Directory domain, then it is strongly advised
%           to rejoin all currently joined join-points in order to
%           avoid possible mismatch between current and previous
%           hostname and joined machine account name.
Example
ise/admin(config)# hostname new-hostname
% Changing the hostname will cause ISE services to restart

Usage Guidelines
Supported IPv6 address formats include:
Full notation: Eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons. For example, 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
Shortened notation: Exclude leading zeros in a group; replace groups of zeros with two consecutive colons. For example: 2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334
Dotted-quad notation (IPv4-mapped and IPv4 compatible-IPv6 addresses): For example, ::ffff:192.0.2.128
Use the ip host command to add host alias and fully qualified domain name (FQDN) string for an IP address mapping. It is used to find out the matching FQDN for ethernet interfaces such as eth1, eth2, and eth3. Use the show running-config command to view the host alias definitions.
You can provide either the host alias or the FQDN string, or both. If you provide both the values, the host alias must match the first component of the FQDN string. If you provide only the FQDN string, Cisco ISE replaces the IP address in the URL with the FQDN. If you provide only the host alias, Cisco ISE combines the host alias with the configured IP domain name to form a complete FQDN, and replaces the IP address of the network interface in the URL with the FQDN.
Example 1

ip mtu
To set the maximum transmission unit (MTU) size of IP packets sent and received on an interface, use the ip mtu command in the interface configuration mode. To restore the default MTU size, use the no form of this command.
ip mtu bytes
no ip mtu bytes
Syntax Description
mtu
Configures the MTU on a Cisco ISE interface.
bytes
The size in bytes of the MTU ranges from 1300 to 1500. The default MTU value is 1500.
Command Default
The MTU is set as 1500.
Command Modes
Interface configuration (config-GigabitEthernet)#
Command History
Release
Modification
2.4.0.357
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
If an IP packet exceeds the MTU set for the interface, the Cisco ISE will fragment it. All devices on a physical medium must have the same protocol MTU in order to operate.
Example
The following example shows how to configure the MTU on an interface:
ise/admin(config)# int GigabitEthernet 1
ise/admin(config-GigabitEthernet)# ip mtu ?
<1300-1500>  Select MTU value in range of 1300 to 1500
The following example shows the output you can see after configuring the MTU.
ise/admin# show run | in mtu
ip mtu 1350
ip name-server
To set the Domain Name Server (DNS) for use during a DNS query, use the ip name-server command in configuration mode. You can configure one to three DNS servers.
ip name-server ip-address {ip-address *}
To disable this function, use the no form of this command.
no ip name-server ip-address {ip-address *}

Note
Using the no form of this command removes all the name servers from the configuration. The no form of this command and one of the IP names removes only that name server.
Syntax Description
name-server
Configures the IP addresses of the name server(s).
ip-address
Address of a name server.
ip-address*
(Optional). IP addresses of additional name servers.
Note 
You can configure three IPv4 addresses and one IPv6 address in the name server.
If you have the primary Administration node (PAN) auto-failover configuration enabled in your deployment, remove it before you run the ip name-server command and enable it after you configure the DNS server(s).
Command Default
No default behavior or values.
Command Modes
Configuration (config)#
Command History
Release
Modification
2.0.0.306
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
The first name server that is added with the ip name-server command occupies the first position and the system uses that server first to resolve the IP addresses.
You can add name servers to the system using IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. You can configure one to three IPv4 or IPv6 addresses through a single command. If you have already configured the system with four name servers, you must remove at least one server to add additional name servers.
To place a name server in the first position so that the subsystem uses it first, you must remove all name servers with the no form of this command before you proceed.

Note
If you modified this setting for AD connectivity, you must restart Cisco ISE for the changes to take effect. Also, ensure that all DNS servers configured in Cisco ISE are able to resolve all relevant AD DNS records. If the configured AD join points are not correctly resolved after the DNS settings are changed, you must manually perform the Leave operation and re-join the AD join point.
If you have the PAN auto-failover configuration enabled in your deployment, the following message appears:
PAN Auto Failover is enabled, this operation is not
allowed! Please disable PAN Auto-failover first.
Example 1
ise/admin(config)# ip name-server ?
<A.B.C.D>|<valid IPv6 format>  Primary DNS server IP address  
<A.B.C.D>|<valid IPv6 format>  DNS server 2 IP address 
<A.B.C.D>|<valid IPv6 format>  DNS server 3 IP address

ise/admin(config)# ip name-server
Example 2
You can see the following output after you configure the IP name server.
ise/admin# show run | in name-server
ip name-server 171.70.168.183 171.68.226.120 
3201:db8:0:20:f41d:eee:7e66:4eba

Example 3
ise/admin(config)# ip name-server ?
ip name-server 10.126.107.120 10.126.107.107 10.106.230.244
DNS Server was modified. If you modified this setting for AD connectivity, you must restart ISE for the change to take effect.
Do you want to restart ISE now? (yes/no) 
ip route
To configure the static routes, use the ip route command in configuration mode. To remove static routes, use the no form of this command.
ip route prefix mask gateway ip-address
no ip route prefix mask
Syntax Description
prefix
IP route prefix for the destination.
mask
Prefix mask for the destination.
ip-address
IP address of the next hop that can be used to reach that network.
Command Default
No default behavior or values.
Command Modes
Configuration (config)#
Command History
Release
Modification
2.0.0.306
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
Static routes are manually configured, which makes them inflexible (they cannot dynamically adapt to network topology changes), but extremely stable. Static routes optimize bandwidth utilization, because no routing updates need to be sent to maintain them. They also make it easy to enforce routing policy.
While the ip route command can be used to define static routes on individual Cisco ISE node, this command is enhanced to define a default route for each interface and reduce the effects of asymmetrical IP forwarding, which is inherent in multi-interface IP nodes.
When a single default route is configured on a multi-interface node, all IP traffic received from any of the node's IP interfaces is routed to the next hop of the default gateway that produces asymmetrical IP forwarding. Configuring multiple default routes on the Cisco ISE node eliminates the effects of asymmetric forwarding.
The following example describes how to configure multiple default routes:
Consider the following interface configuration on Cisco ISE node eth0, eth1, eth2, and eth3 interfaces respectively:
ISE InterfaceIPNetworkGateway
192.168.114.10 192.168.114.0 192.168.114.1
192.168.115.10 192.168.115.0 192.168.115.1
192.168.116.10 192.168.116.0 192.168.116.1
192.168.117.10 192.168.117.0 192.168.117.1
The ip route command is used here to define default routes for each interface.
ise/admin(config)# ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.114.1
ise/admin(config)# ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.115.1
ise/admin(config)# ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.116.1
ise/admin(config)# ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.117.1
ise/admin(config)# ip default-gateway 192.168.118.1

Note
The "ip default-gateway" shown above is the route of last resort for all interfaces.
The show ip route command displays the output of the static routes created using the ip route command (default routes and non-default routes) and system created routes including the one configured using "ip default gateway" command. It displays the outgoing interface for each of the routes.

Note
When you change the IP address of an interface and if any static route becomes unreachable due to an unreachable gateway, the static route gets deleted from the running configuration. The console displays the route that has become unreachable.
Example 2
ise/admin(config)# ip route 192.168.0.0 255.255.0.0 gateway 172.23.90.2
ise/admin(config)#
ipv6 address
To configure a static IPv6 address based on an IPv6 general prefix and enable IPv6 processing for an interface, use the ipv6 address command in interface configuration mode.
ipv6 address ipv6-address/prefix-length
To remove an IPv6 address or disable IPv6 processing, use the no form of this command.
no ipv6 address ipv6-address/prefix-length
Syntax Description
ipv6-address
IPv6 address.
prefix-length
The length of the IPv6 prefix. A decimal value between 0 and 128 that indicates how many of the high-order contiguous bits of the address comprise the prefix (the network portion of the address). A slash mark must precede the decimal value.
If you have the Primary Administration Node (PAN) auto-failover configuration enabled, disable it before you set the IPv6 address. You can enable the PAN auto-failover configuration after the IPv6 address is configured.
If you have the PAN auto-failover configuration enabled in your deployment, the following message appears:
PAN Auto Failover is enabled, this operation is not
allowed! Please disable PAN Auto-failover first.
Command Default
No default behavior or values.
Command Modes

Usage Guidelines
Supported IPv6 address formats include:
Full notation: Eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons. For example, 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
Shortened notation: Exclude leading zeros in a group; replace groups of zeros with two consecutive colons. For example: 2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334
Dotted-quad notation (IPv4-mapped and IPv4-compatible IPv6 addresses): For example, ::ffff:192.0.2.128
Using the fe80 prefix assigns a link-local address. Assigning a global address to the interface automatically creates a link-local address.

Note
If 'Ctrl-C' is issued during the CLI configuration change of ipv6 address command, in case of IPv6 address change, the system may end up in a state where some application components have the old IPv6 address, and some components use the new IPv6 address.
This will bring the Cisco ISE node into a non-working state. The workaround for this is to issue another ipv6 address command to set the IPv6 address to the desired value.
Example 1
ise/admin(config)# interface GigabitEthernet 1
ise/admin(config-GigabitEthernet)# ipv6 address 2001:DB8:0:1::/64
Changing the IPv6 address may result in undesired side effects on any installed application(s).

ipv6 address autoconfig
To enable automatic configuration of IPv6 addresses using stateless autoconfiguration on an interface and enable IPv6 processing on the interface, use the ipv6 address autoconfig command in interface configuration mode.
IPv6 address autoconfiguration is enabled by default in Linux. Cisco ADE 2.0 shows the IPv6 address autoconfiguration in the running configuration for any interface that is enabled.

Usage Guidelines
IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration has the security downfall of having predictable IP addresses. This downfall is resolved with privacy extensions. You can verify that the privacy extensions feature is enabled by using the show interface command.
Example
ise/admin(config-GigabitEthernet)# ipv6 address autoconfig
ise/admin(config)#
Configuring IPv6 Auto Configuration
Verifying the Privacy Extensions Feature
Configuring IPv6 Auto Configuration
To enable IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration, use the interface GigabitEthernet 0 command in Interface configuration mode:
ise/admin# configure terminal
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
ise/admin(config)# interface GigabitEthernet 0
ise/admin(config)# (config-GigabitEthernet)# ipv6 address autoconfig
ise/admin(config)# (config-GigabitEthernet)# end
ise/admin#
When IPv6 autoconfiguration is enabled, the running configuration shows the interface settings similar to the following:
!
interface GigabitEthernet 0
  ip address 172.23.90.116 255.255.255.0
  ipv6 address autoconfig
!
You can use the show interface GigabitEthernet 0 command to display the interface settings. In the example below, you can see that the interface has three IPv6 addresses. The first address (starting with 3ffe) is obtained using the stateless autoconfiguration.
For the stateless autoconfiguration to work, you must have IPv6 route advertisement enabled on that subnet. The next address (starting with fe80) is a link-local address that does not have any scope outside the host.
You will always see a link local address regardless of the IPv6 autoconfiguration or DHCPv6 configuration. The last address (starting with 2001) is obtained from a IPv6 DHCP server.
ise/admin# show interface GigabitEthernet 0

ise/admin#
Verifying the Privacy Extensions Feature
To verify that the privacy extensions feature is enabled, you can use the show interface GigabitEthernet 0 command. You can see two autoconfiguration addresses: one address is without the privacy extensions, and the other is with the privacy extensions.
In the example below, the MAC is 3ffe:302:11:2:20c:29ff:feaf:da05/64 and the non-RFC3041 address contains the MAC, and the privacy-extension address is 302:11:2:9d65:e608:59a9:d4b9/64.
The output appears similar to the following:
ise/admin# show interface GigabitEthernet 0

ise/admin(config)# ntp authentication-key 2 md5 plain SharedWithServ
ise/admin(config)# ntp authentication-key 3 md5 plain SharedWithSer
Example 3
ise/admin(config)# no ntp authentication-key 3 
(Removes authentication key 3.)
Example 4
ise/admin(config)# no ntp authentication-key
(Removes all authentication keys.)
ntp server
To allow for software clock synchronization by the NTP server for the system, use the ntp server command in configuration mode. Allows up to three servers each with a key in a separate line. The key is an optional parameter but the key is required for NTP authentication.
Cisco ISE also supports public-key authentication for NTP servers. NTPv4 uses symmetric-key cryptography and also provides a new Autokey scheme based on public-key cryptography. Public-key cryptography is generally considered more secure than symmetric-key cryptography because the security is based on a private value, which is generated by each server and never revealed. With Autokey, all key distribution and management functions involve only public values, which considerably simplifies key distribution and storage. We recommend that you use the IFF (identify Friend or Foe) Identification scheme as this scheme is most widely used.
The Cisco ISE always requires a valid and reachable NTP server.
Although key is an optional parameter, it must be configured if you need to authenticate an NTP server.
To disable this capability, use the no form of this command only when you want to remove an NTP server and add another one.
ntp server {ip-address | hostname} {autokey | key <peer key number>}
Syntax Description
server
Allows the system to synchronize with a specified server.
ip-address | hostname
IPv4 or address or hostname of the server providing the clock synchronization. Arguments are limited to 255 alphanumeric characters.
autokey
Specifies that public-key authentication should be used for NTP server. If you choose this option, ensure that you import the NTP server's public key in to the Cisco ISE node using the crypto command.
key
(Optional). Peer key number. Supports up to 65535 numeric characters.
This key needs to be defined with a key value, by using the ntp authentication-key command, and also needs to be added as a trusted-key by using the ntp trusted-key command.
For authentication to work, the key and the key value should be the same as that which is defined on the actual NTP server.
Command Default
No servers are configured by default.
Command Modes
Configuration (config)#
Command History
Release
Modification
2.0.0.306
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
Use this ntp server command with a trusted key if you want to allow the system to synchronize with a specified server.
The key is optional, but it is required for NTP authentication. Define this key in the ntp authentication-key command first and add this key to the ntp trusted-key command before you can add it to the ntp server command.
The show ntp command displays the status of synchronization. If none of the configured NTP servers are reachable or not authenticated (if NTP authentication is configured), then this command displays synchronization to local with the least stratum.
If an NTP server is not reachable or is not properly authenticated, then its reach as per this command statistics will be 0.
To define an NTP server configuration and authentication keys from the Cisco ISE Admin portal, see the System Time and NTP Server Settings section in the Cisco Identity Services Engine Administration Guide. You can configure Autokey for NTP server only from the Cisco ISE CLI in Configuration Mode. After you configure Autokey for NTP server, be sure to import the public keys generated from the NTP server. See the crypto command for more information.

Note
When you use public-key authentication for NTP servers:
Ensure that the NTP server available in the network is configured with Autokey. The NTP server must be reachable through DNS/hostname address. For information on how to configure Autokey for NTP servers, see the NTP Support Web.
Generate key pairs on the NTP server using the ntp-keygen-T command and obtain the trusted public key of the NTP server. Import the public key in to Cisco ISE using the crypto command.

Note
This command gives conflicting information during the synchronization process. The synchronization process can take up to 20 minutes to complete.
Example
ise/admin# configure terminal 
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
ise/admin(config)# ntp server 209.165.200.225 autokey

Usage Guidelines
When you shut down an interface using this command, you lose connectivity to the Cisco ISE appliance through that interface (even though the appliance is still powered on).
However, if you have configured the second interface on the appliance with a different IP and have not shut down that interface, you can access the appliance through that second interface.
To shut down an interface, you can also modify the ifcfg-eth[0,1] file, which is located at /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts, using the ONBOOT parameter:
Disable an interface: set ONBOOT="no”
Enable an interface: set ONBOOT="yes"
You can also use the no shutdown command to enable an interface.
Example
ise/admin(config)# interface GigabitEthernet 0
ise/admin(config-GigabitEthernet)# shutdown
snmp-server enable

snmp-server user
To configure a new SNMP user, use the snmp-server user command in global configuration mode.
snmp-server user username v3 {hash | plain} auth-password priv-password

Note
This command must be used only for SNMP version 3.
To remove a specified SNMP user, use the no form of this command.
Syntax Description
user
Configure a new user.
username
The name of the user on the host that belongs to the SNMP agent.
Do not use special characters - or _ in usernames.
v3
Version of the SNMP used to send the traps.
Specifies that the SNMP Version 3 security model should be used for enabling the priv and the auth keywords.
{hash | plain}
Password is in encrypted or plain format. Encrypted passwords must be in hexadecimal format.
auth-password
Specifies the authentication user password. The minimum length for a password is one character; however, we recommend that you use at least eight characters for security
Note 
If you forget a password, you cannot recover it, and must reconfigure the user. You can specify a plain-text password or a localized digest. The localized digest must match the authentication algorithm selected for the user, which can be either MD5 or SHA. When the user configuration is displayed on the console or is written to a file (for example, the startup-configuration file), the localized authentication and privacy digests are always displayed instead of the plain-text password.
priv-password
Specifies the encryption user password. The minimum length for a password is one character; however, we recommend that you use at least eight characters for security.
Note 
If you forget a password, you cannot recover it, and must reconfigure the user. You can specify a plain-text password or a localized digest. The localized digest must match the authentication algorithm selected for the user, which can be either MD5 or SHA. When the user configuration is displayed on the console or is written to a file (for example, the startup-configuration file), the localized authentication and privacy digests are always displayed instead of the plain-text password.
Command Default

Command History
Release
Modification
2.0.0.306
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
After you configure users, make sure to configure SNMP Version 3 hosts. Along with the target IP address, you must configure a username, because traps are only sent to a configured user.
Example
ise/admin(config)# snmp-server user testuser v3 hash authpassword privpassword
ise/admin(config)#
snmp-server host
To send SNMP traps to a recipient, use the snmp-server host command in configuration mode. By default, SNMP traps are enabled. By default, the UDP port is 162.

Note
SNMP user needs to be created before using the snmp-server host command.
snmp-server host {ip-address | hostname} version {{1 | 2c} community | 3 username engine_ID {hash | plain} auth-password priv-password}
To remove trap forwarding, use the no form of this command.

Note
When SNMP Version 3 hosts are configured in Cisco ISE, a user must be associated with that host because traps are sent only to a configured user. To receive traps, after you have added the snmp-server host command, you must configure the user credentials on the NMS with the same credentials as those configured in Cisco ISE.
Syntax Description
host
Configures hosts to receive SNMP notifications.
ip-address
IP address of the SNMP notification host. Supports up to 32 alphanumeric characters.
hostname
Name of the SNMP notification host. Supports up to 32 alphanumeric characters.
version {1 | 2c | 3}
(Optional). Version of the SNMP used to send the traps. Default = 1.
If you use the version keyword, specify one of the following keywords:
1—SNMPv1.
2c—SNMPv2C.
3—SNMP v3.
community
Specifies the shared secret key between Cisco ISE and the NMS. Case-sensitive value that can be up to 32 characters in length. Spaces are not allowed. The default community-string is "public." Cisco ISE users this key to determine whether the incoming SNMP request is valid.
username
(Optional; required only if you choose SNMP version 3) Associates a user with the host when SNMP Version 3 hosts are configured in Cisco ISE.
engine_ID
(Optional; required only if you choose SNMP version 3) Remote EngineID.
auth-password
(Optional; required only if you choose SNMP version 3) Specifies the authentication user password.
priv-password
(Optional; required only if you choose SNMP version 3) Specifies the encryption user password.
Command Default
Enabled.
Command Modes
Configuration (config)#
Command History
Release
Modification
2.0.0.306
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
Cisco ISE sends a 'coldStart(0)' trap when the appliance boots up (reloads), if SNMP is already configured. Cisco ISE uses the Net-SNMP client that sends a 'coldStart(0)' trap when it first starts up, and an enterprise-specific trap 'nsNotifyShutdown' when it stops.
It generates an enterprise-specific trap 'nsNotifyRestart' (rather than the standard 'coldStart(0)' or 'warmStart(1)' traps) typically after you reconfigure SNMP using the snmp-server host command.
Examples
ise/admin(config)# snmp-server community new ro

snmp-server trap dskThresholdLimit
To configure the SNMP server to receive traps if one of the Cisco ISE partitions reaches its threshold disk utilization limit, use the snmp-server trap dskThresholdLimit command in Configuration mode.
snmp-server trap dskThresholdLimit value
To stop sending disk threshold utilization limit traps, use the no form of this command.

Command Default
No default behavior or values.
Command Modes
Configuration (config)#
Command History
Release
Modification
2.1.0.474
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
This configuration is common for all the partitions in Cisco ISE. If you configure the threshold limit as 40, then you will receive a trap as soon as a partition utilizes 60% of its disk space and only 40% of the disk space is available. That is, a trap is sent when the configured amount of free space is reached.
After you configure this command from the Cisco ISE CLI, a kron job runs every five minutes and monitors the Cisco ISE partitions one by one. If any one of the partitions reaches its threshold limit, then Cisco ISE sends a trap to the configured SNMP server with the disk path and the threshold limit value. Multiple traps are sent if multiple partitions reached the threshold limit. You can view the SNMP traps using the traps receiver in a MIB browser.
Example
ise/admin(config)# snmp-server trap dskThresholdLimit 40 
ise/admin(config)#
