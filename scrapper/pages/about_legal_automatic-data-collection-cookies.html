Cisco use of cookies and other tracking technologies
Our services (including our websites, web-based products and services, mobile apps, e-mail, and marketing/advertising communications, together the "services") use cookies and other similar device identification technologies (collectively "cookies") to provide our services, to understand how they are used, and for analytics, personalization, customization and marketing/advertising purposes. You can read more about the types of cookies we (Cisco and our third-party service providers) use, why we use them, and how you can exercise your cookies choices below.
Our services may also include “widgets,” which are interactive mini programs that run on our sites to provide specific services from other companies (such as displaying the news, opinions, music, and more). Personal information, such as your email address, may be collected through the widget. Cookies may also be set by the widget to enable it to function properly. Information collected by these widgets is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it.
What are cookies?
We use the term “cookie” to refer to all technologies which store and access information on the device that you use to access our services, such as your computer, tablet, or mobile phone. For example, we use HTTP cookies (web/browser cookies), which are small data files (typically made up of numbers and letters) that are downloaded when you access our services and allow us to recognize your device. Click here for more information on cookies.
Cookies can be necessary and useful in a number of ways. For example, cookies enable websites to recognize your device and are often used to help the website function properly and to provide information to the owner(s) of the site. Cookies are necessary to recognize or “remember” anything about visitors, such as:
Whether a visitor is logged in
User-selected preferences
Items put in a user’s shopping cart
There are different types of cookies, including:
Cookies served (i.e., set, shared, provided, offered) directly by Cisco ("first party cookies") and cookies served on our behalf, for example by advertising and data analytics service providers ("third party cookies")
Cookies that only last as long as your browser is open are referred to as "session cookies." Session cookies are deleted automatically when you close your browser.
Other cookies are "persistent cookies" and remain after your browser is closed, until cleared. For example, they store your device identifier and recognize your device when you open and use your browser.
Which cookies do we use, and why do we use them?
The following table sets out the different types of cookies that our services use, why they are served them, and who serves them.

Essential Authentication Cookies
These cookies (including local storage and similar technologies) tell us when you are logged in, so we can show you the appropriate experience and features such as your account information, trip history, and to edit your account settings.
Cisco
Security and site integrity cookies
We use these cookies to support or enable security features to help keep Cisco safe and secure. For example, they enable us to remember when you are logged into a secure area of the services and help protect your account from being accessed by anyone other than you.

Advertising
Things like cookies and pixels are used to understand and deliver ads, make them more relevant, and track the efficacy of mobile application advertising campaigns.
For example, we may read a cookie so we can serve you ads that may be interesting (including personalized or customized) on other websites. We also use this information to retarget users with relevant advertising. Similarly, our partners may use a cookie, attribution service, or other similar technology to determine whether we have served an ad and how it performed or provide us with information about how you interact with them. This may involve storing cookies on your local device.

How can you exercise your cookies choices?
You have the right to choose not to accept certain cookies. However, even optional cookies are an important part of how our services work, so you should be aware that if you choose to refuse or remove certain cookies, this could affect the usability and functionality of our services.
Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. To do so, follow the instructions provided in your browser. Instructions are generally located within the "Help," "Tools," or "Edit" menus.
Some third parties also provide the ability to refuse advertising cookies directly by clicking on an opt-out link or you can opt-out proactively. How to opt out of interest-based advertising:
If you are located in the European Union
If you are located in Canada
If you are located in all other parts of the world
Removing or rejecting browser cookies does not necessarily affect third-party flash cookies used in connection with our services. Get more information on how to delete or disable flash cookies.
You can also change your preferences in relation to how this website uses cookies.
For more information
For further information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, visit AllAboutCookies.org and Your Online Choices (for European Union residents).
"Do not track" function
Some web browsers may give you the ability to enable a "do not track" feature that sends signals to the services you visit, indicating that you do not want your online activities tracked. This is different than blocking or deleting cookies as browsers with a "do not track" feature enabled may still accept cookies. There is currently no industry standard for how companies should respond to "do not track" signals, although one may develop in the future. Cisco does not respond to "do not track" signals currently. If Cisco does so in the future, we will describe how in this privacy statement. Learn more information about "do not track."
