Introduction
This document describes the steps required for the configuration and registration of a Cisco IOS®-XErouter with Smart Licensing Using Policy feature.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:
Smart Licensing Using Policy registration
Smart Licensing Using Policy transport methods
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software versions:
Cisco Smart License Utility version 1.0.0-2  installed on Windows Personal Computer (PC) with Smart Account and Virtual Account configured
On Integrated Services Routers (ISR),  Aggregation Services Routers (ASR) 1000, Catalyst 8300, 8500 and 9000: Cisco IOS-XE 17.3.2
On Catalyst 8200 and 1100: Cisco IOS-XE 17.4.1
Cloud Services Router (CSR) and ISR virtual require an upgrade to Catalyst 8000v and Cisco IOS-XE 17.4.1
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Configure
This document describes the next four possible topologies and configurations required when you use Smart Licensing Using Policy, these options depend on how the router is connected to the network.
Router connected to Cisco Smart Software Manager (CSSM) through Cisco Smart License Utility (CSLU).
Router directly connected to CSSM.
Router connected to CSLU and CSLU disconnected from CSSM.
Router not connected to the CSSM and without CSLU in place.
Router Connected to CSSM Through CSLU
On this topology, the product instances in the network are connected to CSSM through CSLU. CSLU becomes the single point of communication with CSSM.
In this section, it is explained Pull and Push methods and their respective configuration.
Network Diagram
Push Method Configuration
On this method, the product instance initiates the communication with CSLU, by a connection to a Representational State Transfer (REST) endpoint in CSLU. 
The data that is sent includes Real User Monitoring (RUM) reports and requests for authorization codes, trust codes and policies.
Configuration Steps
Step 1. Log in to CSLU Interface and choose Add Single Product.
Step 2. Choose Product Instance Initiated only, and define the IP address of the product instance to be registered.
Step 3. On the router, configure the transport method to cslu.
Device(config)# license smart transport cslu
Step 4. Enter the CSLU URL with the CSLU IP address.
Device(config)# license smart url cslu http://<cslu-ip>:8182/cslu/v1/pi
Step 5. Configure the interface by which the HTTP message.
5.1. Configure the interface by which the HTTP message is sent with this command:
Device(config)# ip http client source-interface interface-type-number
5.2. If you use a VRF to reach CSLU and instead of an ip address you use cslu-local to resolve, you need to add the hostname resolution for cslu-local with this command:
Device(config)# ip host vrf Name_VRF cslu-local cslu-ip-address
Step 6. Initiate the communication and report of usage. Verify logs for correct policy installation.
Device# license smart sync

*Apr 14 12:08:06.235: %SMART_LIC-6-POLICY_INSTALL_SUCCESS: A new licensing policy was successfully installed
Pull Method Configuration
On this method, CSLU initiates the communication with the product instance in order to retrieve its information.
CSLU uses Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF), Representational State Transfer Configuration Protocol (RESTCONF), google Remote Procedure Calls (gRPC) with Yet Another Next Generation (YANG) models, or REST Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to connect to the product instances.
Configuration Steps
Step 1. On the router, configure your preferred method of connectivity (NETCONF, RESTCONF, or REST API).
Step 2. Log in to CSLU Interface and choose Add Single Product.
Step 3. Choose any of the CSLU Initiated options related to the desired connection method (NETCONF, RESTCONF, or REST API), and define the IP address of the product instance to be registered.
Step 4. Choose from the list of Product Instances, the device to be registered and navigate to Actions for Selected and Collect Usage.
Step 5. Verify the completion of the collection of license usage under that product instance.
Step 6. On the registered device, you must see a licensing policy installation successful log.
*Nov 18 23:22:12.929: %SMART_LIC-6-POLICY_INSTALL_SUCCESS: A new licensing policy was succesfully installed
Router Directly Connected to CSSM
On this topology, you establish a direct and trusted connection from a product instance to CSSM, and you have 2 possible transport methods:
Smart Transport Method. A Smart Licensing JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) message is contained within a HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) message and exchanged between a product instance and the CSSM.
Call-home Transport Method. Call-home provides e-mail-based and web-based notification of critical system events.®
Network Diagram
Smart Transport Method Configuration
Configuration Steps
Step 1. Configure the interface by which the HTTP message is sent.
Device(config)# ip http client source-interface interface-type-number
Step 2. Define smart transport method, as the desired license transport method.
Device(config)# license smart transport smart
Step 3. Set the license smart Uniform Resource Locator (URL) as default.
3.1. In order to set license smart URL as default use this command:
Device(config)# license smart url default
3.2. If you use a proxy to reach CSSM, you need to add the proxy for smart:
Device(config)# license smart proxy X.X.X.X port XXXX
Step 4. Generate a new token from CSSM under your Smart Account and Virtual Account and copy the generated token.
Step 5. Register the device with the token generated.
Device# license smart trust idtoken id_token_value {local| all} [force]
Step 6. Verify in show license status command the correct installation. At the end of the output, on Trust Code Installed section, it must be updated with the registration date.
Device# show license status

Call-home Transport Method Configuration
Configuration Steps
Step 1. Configure the interface by which the HTTP message is sent.
Device(config)# ip http client source-interface interface-type-number
Step 2. Define call-home transport method, as the desired license transport method.
Device(config)# license smart transport callhome
Step 3. Modify the license smart URL.
3.1. In order to set license smart URL use this command:
Device(config)# license smart url https://tools.cisco.com/its/service/oddce/services/DDCEService
3.2. If you use Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) you must specify the source interface used by the VRF on call-home in addition to the VRF used:
Device(config)# call-home
Device(cfg-call-home)# source-interface interface-type-number
Device(cfg-call-home)# vrf Name_of_VRF
3.3. If you use a proxy to reach CSSM, you need to add the proxy to the call-home configuration, with the interface used to reach the proxy:
Device(config)# call-home
Device(cfg-call-home)# source-interface interface-type-number
Device(cfg-call-home)# http-proxy "X.X.X.X" port XXXX
Step 4. Generate a new token from CSSM under your Smart Account and Virtual Account and copy the generated token.
Step 5. Register the device with the token generated.
Device# license smart trust idtoken id_token_value {local| all} [force]
Step 6. Verify in show license status command the correct installation. At the end of the output, on Trust Code Installed section, it must be updated with the registration date.
Device# show license status
Transport:
  Type: Callhome
  URL: https://tools.cisco.com/its/service/oddce/services/DDCEService
