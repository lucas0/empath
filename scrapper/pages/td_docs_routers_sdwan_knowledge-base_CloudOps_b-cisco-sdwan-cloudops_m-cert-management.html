Web Server Certificates
Renew Cisco SD-WAN SSL Certificates for Controllers
Web Server Certificates
Cisco does not issue web certificates for Cisco SD-WAN Manager. We recommend that you generate the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and get it signed by your Certificate Authority (CA) for your Domain Name System (DNS) name. Then, you may either add an A entry in your DNS server for the IP, or a CNAME to the .viptela.net / .sdwan.cisco.com vManage DNS name.

Note
The controller certificates issued by Cisco are for the controllers to use internally. You cannot use these certificates to issue web server certificates.
For more information, see the Web Server Certificates section in the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Getting Started Guide.
Renew Cisco SD-WAN SSL Certificates for Controllers
Signed certificates are used to authenticate devices in the overlay network. After being authenticated, devices can establish secure sessions between each other.

Note
The certificate renewal process is applicable only if you have a dedicated single tenant or multi-tenant controller overlay. This process is not applicable if you have a shared tenant overlay.
You can generate the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) as well as install the signed certificates, using Cisco vManage. There are 3 options for Certificate Root CA:
Cisco Root CA bundle (already present on controllers with software version 19.2.3 and above, Cisco SD-WAN devices with software version 19.2.3 and above, Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices with software versions 16.12.3+ or 16.10.4+ or 17.x+.
Symantec/Digicert Root CA (already present on all controllers, Cisco SD-WAN devices and Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices).
Your own Enterprise Root CA.

Note
Select the certificate-generation method only once. The method you select is automatically applied each time you add a device to the overlay network.
To renew the controller certificates, you need to follow the appropriate process based on your deployment type and certificate type:
The controller certification authorization settings configure the certification- generation process for all controller devices. For more information, see Cisco SD-WAN Controller Certificates.
Note that since the certificate renewal involves an entire control plane flap, you are required to follow the instructions as per above, to renew the certificates, even for cloud hosted Cisco provisioned controllers.
The Cisco CloudOps team does not automatically renew the certificates for the customers.
On the Cisco vManage Settings page, there is an option for Symantec Automated or Cisco Automated where automated refers to automatic submission of CSRs and retrieval of certificates. The option does include automation of certain steps of the process, compared to the manual option. However, the step to trigger the generation of CSRs for each controller is still manual, to be done by you, to initiate the renewal process.
Note that the Cisco vManage Dashboard shows a warning 6 months in advance that the certificates are about to expire.
You can view the expiry date at any time at Cisco vManage > Configuration > Certificates > Controllers.
The Cisco CloudOps team sends email notifications 30/15/5 day prior to expiry, to the registered email address contact for the overlay in your system as well.
You can open a case with us anytime to request the current registered email address or change it. We do recommend customers to help keep the owner email address updated for all Cisco CloudOps notifications. We highly recommend to keep us updated with the customer contact email address for alert notifications, preferably a team mailer address instead of an individual user email address.
Also, we recommend to be aware of the controller certificate expiry dates and plan for renewal atleast a 1 month before expiry.
