New Features by Release
This document lists new and deprecated features for each release.
Although you can manage older devices with a newer customer-deployed (or on prem) management center, we recommend you always update your entire deployment. New traffic-handling features usually require the latest release on both the management center and device. Features where devices are not obviously involved (cosmetic changes to the web interface, cloud integrations) may only require the latest version on the management center, but that is not guaranteed. In this document, we are explicit when version requirements deviate from the standard expectation.
Suggested Release
Suggested Release: Version 7.0.5
To take advantage of new features and resolved issues, we recommend you upgrade all eligible appliances to at least the suggested release. On the Cisco Support & Download site, the suggested release is marked with a gold star.
Suggested Releases for Older Appliances
If an appliance is too old to run the suggested release and you do not plan to refresh the hardware right now, choose a major version then patch as far as possible. Some major versions are designated long-term or extra long-term, so consider one of those. For an explanation of these terms, see Cisco NGFW Product Line Software Release and Sustaining Bulletin.
If you are interested in a hardware refresh, contact your Cisco representative or partner contact.

Management center virtual 300 for KVM.
We introduced the FMCv300 for KVM. The FMCv300 can manage up to 300 devices.
Minimum threat defense: Any
Network modules for the Secure Firewall 4100.
You can now manage the Secure Firewall 4100 with the following network modules:
2-port 100G Network Module (FPR-NM-2X100G)
Minimum threat defense: 7.3
ISA 3000 System LED support for shutting down.
Support returns for this feature. When you shut down the ISA 3000, the System LED turns off. Wait at least 10 seconds after that before you remove power from the device. This feature was introduced in Version 7.0.5 but was temporarily deprecated in Version 7.1–7.2.
Interfaces
IPv6 support for virtual appliances.
Threat defense virtual and management center virtual now support IPv6 in the following environments:
AWS
Azure
OCI
KVM
VMware
For more information, see Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Virtual Getting Started Guide and Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center Virtual Getting Started Guide.
Loopback interface support for VTIs.
You can now configure a loopback interface for redundancy of static and dynamic VTI VPN tunnels. A loopback interface is a software interface that emulates a physical interface. It is reachable through multiple physical interfaces with IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
New/modified screens: Devices > Device Management > Device > Interfaces > Add Interfaces > Add Loopback Interface
For more information, see Configure Loopback Interfaces in the device configuration guide.
Redundant manager access data interface.
When you use a data interface for manager access, you can configure a secondary data interface to take over management functions if the primary interface goes down. The device uses SLA monitoring to track the viability of the static routes and an ECMP zone that contains both interfaces so management traffic can use both interfaces.
New/modified screens:
Devices > Device Management > Device > Management
Devices > Device Management > Device > Interfaces > Manager Access
For more information, see Configure a Redundant Manager Access Data Interface in the device configuration guide.
IPv6 DHCP.
We now support the following features for IPv6 addressing:
DHCPv6 Address client: Threat defense obtains an IPv6 global address and optional default route from the DHCPv6 server.
DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation client: Threat defense obtains delegated prefix(es) from a DHCPv6 server. It can then use these prefixes to configure other threat defense interface addresses so that StateLess Address Auto Configuration (SLAAC) clients can autoconfigure IPv6 addresses on the same network.
BGP router advertisement for delegated prefixes.
DHCPv6 stateless server: Threat defense provides other information such as the domain name to SLAAC clients when they send Information Request (IR) packets to threat defense. Threat defense only accepts IR packets and does not assign addresses to the clients.
New/modified screens:
Devices > Device Management > Device > Interfaces > Interface > IPv6 > DHCP
Objects > Object Management > DHCP IPv6 Pool
New/modified CLI commands: show bgp ipv6 unicast , show ipv6 dhcp , show ipv6 general-prefix
For more information, see Configure the IPv6 Prefix Delegation Client, BGP, and Configure the DHCPv6 Stateless Server in the device configuration guide.
Paired proxy VXLAN for the threat defense virtual for the Azure Gateway Load Balancer.
You can configure a paired proxy mode VXLAN interface for threat defense virtual for Azure for use with the Azure Gateway Load Balancer. The device defines an external interface and an internal interface on a single NIC by utilizing VXLAN segments in a paired proxy.
New/modified screens: Devices > Device Management > Device > Interfaces > Add Interfaces > VNI Interface
For more information, see Configure VXLAN Interfaces in the device configuration guide.
Forward Error Correction (FEC) defaults changed for fixed ports.
When you set the FEC to Auto on the Secure Firewall 3100 fixed ports, the default type is now set to Clause 108 RS-FEC instead of Clause 74 FC-FEC for 25 GB+ SR, CSR, and LR transceivers.
For more information, see Interface Overview in the device configuration guide.
High Availability/Scalability
High availability for management center virtual for KVM and Azure.
We now support high availability for management center virtual for KVM and Azure.
In a threat defense deployment, you need two identically licensed management centers, as well as one threat defense entitlement for each managed device. For example, to manage 10 devices with an FMCv10 high availability pair, you need two FMCv10 entitlements and 10 threat defense entitlements. If you are managing Version 7.0.x Classic devices only (NGIPSv or ASA FirePOWER), you do not need FMCv entitlements.
Supported platforms: FMCv10, FMCv25, FMCv300 (not supported for FMCv2)
For more information, see the Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center Virtual Getting Started Guide, as well as High Availability in the administration guide.
Clustering for threat defense virtual for Azure.
You can now configure clustering for up to 16 nodes with threat defense virtual for Azure.
New/modified screens: Devices > Device Management
For more information, see Clustering for Threat Defense Virtual in a Public Cloud in the device configuration guide.
Autoscale for threat defense virtual for Azure Gateway Load Balancers.
We now support autoscale for threat defense virtual for Azure Gateway Load Balancers. For more information, see the Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Virtual Getting Started Guide.
Backup and restore support for clustered devices.
You can now use the management center to perform backups of clusters. To restore the cluster nodes, you must use the device CLI.
New/modified screens: System () > Tools > Backup/Restore > Managed Device Backup
New/modified CLI commands: restore remote-manager-backup
For more information, see Backup/Restore in the administration guide.
Remote Access VPN
RA VPN dashboard.
We introduced a remote access VPN (RA VPN) dashboard that allows you to monitor real-time data from active RA VPN sessions on the devices. So that you can quickly determine problems related to user sessions and mitigate the problems for your network and users, the dashboard provides:
Visualization of active user sessions based on their location.
Detailed information about the active user sessions.
Mitigation of user session problems by terminating sessions, if required.
Distribution of active user sessions per device, encryption type, Secure Client version, operating system, and connection profile.
Device identity certificate expiration details of the devices.
New/modified screens: Overview > Dashboards > Remote Access VPN
For more information, see Dashboards in the administration guide.
Encrypt RA VPN connections with TLS 1.3.
You can now use TLS 1.3 to encrypt RA VPN connections with the following ciphers:
TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
Use the threat defense platform settings to set the TLS version: Devices > Platform Settings > Add/Edit Threat Defense Settings Policy > SSL > TLS Version.
This feature requires Cisco Secure Client, Release 5 (formerly known as the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client).
For more information, see Configure SSL Settings in the device configuration guide.
Site to Site VPN
Packet tracer in the site-to-site VPN dashboard.
We added packet tracer capabilities to the site-to-site VPN dashboard, to help you troubleshoot VPN tunnels between devices.
Open the dashboard by choosing Overview > Dashboards > Site to Site VPN. Then, click View () next to the tunnel you want to investigate, and Packet Tracer in the side pane that appears.
For more information, see Monitoring the Site-to-Site VPNs in the device configuration guide.
Support for dynamic VTIs with site-to-site VPN.
We now support dynamic virtual tunnel interfaces (VTI) when you configure a route-based site-to-site VPN in a hub and spoke topology. Previously, you could use only a static VTI.
This makes it easier to configure large hub and spoke deployments. A single dynamic VTI can replace several static VTI configurations on the hub. And, you can add new spokes to a hub without changing the hub configuration.
New/modified screens: We updated the options when configuring hub-node endpoints for a route-based hub-and-spoke site-to-site VPN topology.
For more information, see Configure Endpoints for a Hub and Spoke Topology in the device configuration guide.
Improved Umbrella SIG integration.
You can now easily deploy IPsec IKEv2 tunnels between a threat defense device and the Umbrella Secure Internet Gateway (SIG), which allows you to forward all internet-bound traffic to Umbrella for inspection and filtering.
To configure and deploy these tunnels, create a SASE topology, a new type of static VTI-based site-to-site VPN topology: Devices > VPN > Site To Site > SASE Topology.
For more information, see Deploy a SASE Tunnel on Umbrella in the device configuration guide.
Routing
Configure BFD for BGP from the management center web interface.
Upgrade impact.
You can now use the management center web interface to configure bidirectional forwarding detection (BFD) for BGP. Note that you can only enable BFD on interfaces belonging to virtual routers. If you have an existing BFD FlexConfig and redo your configurations in the web interface, you cannot deploy until you remove the deprecated FlexConfigs.
New/modified screens:
Devices > Device Management > Device > Routing > BFD
Objects > Object Management > BFD Template
When configuring BGP neighbor settings, we replaced the BFD Failover check box with a menu where you choose the BFD type: single hop, multi hop, auto detect, or none (disabled). For upgraded management centers, auto-detect hop is selected if the old BFD Failover option was enabled and none is selected if the old option was disabled.
For more information, see Bidirectional Forwarding Detection Routing in the device configuration guide.
Support for IPv4 and IPv6 OSPF routing for VTIs.
We now support IPv4 and IPv6 OSPF routing for VTI interfaces.
New/modified pages: You can add VTI interfaces to an OSPF routing process on Devices > Device Management > Device > Routing > OSPF/OSFPv3.
For more information, see OSPF and Additional Configurations for VTI in the device configuration guide.
Support for IPv4 EIGRP routing for VTIs.
We now support IPv4 EIGRP routing for VTI interfaces.
New/modified screens: You can define a VTI as the static neighbor for an EIGRP routing process, configure a VTI's interface-specific EIGRP routing properties. and advertise a VTI's summary address on Devices > Device Management > Device > Routing > EIGRP.
For more information, see EIGRP and Additional Configurations for VTI in the device configuration guide.
More network service groups for policy-based routing.
You can now configure up to 1024 network service groups (application groups in an extended ACL for use in policy-based routing). Previously, the limit was 256.
Support for multiple next-hops while configuring policy-based routing forwarding actions.
You can now configure multiple next-hops while configuring policy-based routing forwarding actions. When traffic matches the criteria for the route, the system attempts to forward traffic to the IP addresses in the order you specify, until it succeeds.
The feature is available on threat defense devices running Version 7.1+ with a Version 7.3+ management center.
New/modified screens: We added several options when you select IP Address from the Send To menu on Devices > Device Management > Device > Routing > Policy Based Routing > Add Policy Based Route > Add Match Criteria and Egress Interface.
For more information, see Configure Policy-Based Routing Policy in the device configuration guide.
Threat Defense Upgrade
Usability improvements.
We introduced some usability improvements to the threat defense upgrade wizard:
You can now use the wizard to select devices to upgrade. You can toggle the view between selected devices, remaining upgrade candidates, ineligible devices (with reasons why), devices that need the upgrade package, and so on.
Previously, you could only use the Device Management page and the process was much less flexible.
You can now use the wizard to upload threat defense upgrade packages or specify upgrade package locations.
Previously, you could only use the System Updates page.
We now allow simultaneous upgrade workflows by different users, as long as you are upgrading different devices. The system prevents you from upgrading devices already in someone else's workflow.
Previously, only one upgrade workflow was allowed at a time across all users.
For all threat defense upgrades, we offer smaller upgrade packages and faster upgrades and readiness checks.
For more information, see Upgrade Threat Defense in the management center upgrade guide.
Unattended upgrades.
The threat defense upgrade wizard now supports unattended upgrades, using a new Unattended Mode menu. You just need to select the target version and the devices you want to upgrade, specify a few upgrade options, and step away. You can even log out or close the browser.
With an unattended upgrade, the system automatically copies needed upgrade packages to devices, performs compatibility and readiness checks, and begins the upgrade. Just as happens when you manually step through the wizard, any devices that do not "pass" a stage in the upgrade (for example, failing checks) are not included in the next stage. After the upgrade completes, you pick up with the verification and post-upgrade tasks.
You can pause and restart unattended mode during the copy and checks phases. However, pausing unattended mode does not stop tasks in progress. Copies and checks that have started will run to completion. Similarly, you cannot cancel an upgrade in progress by stopping unattended mode; to cancel an upgrade, use the Upgrade Status pop-up, accessible from the Upgrade tab on Device Management page, and from the Message Center.
For more information, see Upgrade Threat Defense with the Wizard in Unattended Mode in the management center upgrade guide.
Skip pre-upgrade troubleshoot generation.
From the threat defense upgrade wizard, you can now skip the automatic generating of troubleshooting files before major and maintenance upgrades by disabling the new Generate troubleshooting files before upgrade begins option. This saves time and disk space.
To manually generate troubleshooting files for a threat defense device, choose System () > Health > Monitor, click the device in the left panel, then View System & Troubleshoot Details, then Generate Troubleshooting Files.
For more information, see Upgrade Threat Defense in the management center upgrade guide.
Auto-upgrade to Snort 3 after successful threat defense upgrade is no longer optional.
Upgrade impact.
When you upgrade threat defense to Version 7.3+, you can no longer disable the Upgrade Snort 2 to Snort 3 option.
After the software upgrade, all eligible devices will upgrade from Snort 2 to Snort 3 when you deploy configurations. Although you can switch individual devices back, Snort 2 will be deprecated in a future release and we strongly recommend you stop using it now.
For devices that are ineligible for auto-upgrade because they use custom intrusion or network analysis policies, we strongly recommend you manually upgrade to Snort 3 for improved detection and performance. For migration assistance, see the Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center Snort 3 Configuration Guide for your version.
Choose and direct-download upgrade packages from Cisco.
You can now choose which threat defense upgrade packages you want to direct download to the management center. Use the new Download Updates sub-tab on > Updates > Product Updates.
For more information, see Download Upgrade Packages with the Management Center in the management center upgrade guide.
Combined upgrade and install package for Secure Firewall 3100.
Reimage Impact.
In Version 7.3, we combined the threat defense install and upgrade package for the Secure Firewall 3100, as follows:
Version 7.1–7.2 install package: cisco-ftd-fp3k.version.SPA
Version 7.1–7.2 upgrade package: Cisco_FTD_SSP_FP3K_Upgrade-version-build.sh.REL.tar
Version 7.3+ combined package: Cisco_FTD_SSP_FP3K_Upgrade-version-build.sh.REL.tar
Although you can upgrade threat defense without issue, you cannot reimage from older threat defense and ASA versions directly to threat defense Version 7.3+. This is due to a ROMMON update required by the new image type. To reimage from those older versions, you must "go through" ASA 9.19+, which is supported with the old ROMMON but also updates to the new ROMMON. There is no separate ROMMON updater.
To get to threat defense Version 7.3+, your options are:
Upgrade from threat defense Version 7.1 or 7.2 — use the normal upgrade process.
See the appropriate Upgrade Guide.
Reimage from threat defense Version 7.1 or 7.2 — reimage to ASA 9.19+ first, then reimage to threat defense Version 7.3+.
See Threat Defense→ASA: Firepower 1000, 2100; Secure Firewall 3100 and then ASA→Threat Defense: Firepower 1000, 2100 Appliance Mode; Secure Firewall 3100 in the Cisco Secure Firewall ASA and Secure Firewall Threat Defense Reimage Guide.
Reimage from ASA 9.17 or 9.18 — upgrade to ASA 9.19+ first, then reimage to threat defense Version 7.3+.
See the Cisco Secure Firewall ASA Upgrade Guide and then ASA→Threat Defense: Firepower 1000, 2100 Appliance Mode; Secure Firewall 3100 in the Cisco Secure Firewall ASA and Secure Firewall Threat Defense Reimage Guide.
Reimage from threat defense Version 7.3+ — use the normal reimage process.
See Reimage the System with a New Software Version in the Cisco FXOS Troubleshooting Guide for the Firepower 1000/2100 and Secure Firewall 3100 with Firepower Threat Defense.
Access Control and Threat Detection
SSL policy renamed to decryption policy.
We renamed the SSL policy to the decryption policy. We also added a policy wizard that makes it easier to create and configure decryption policies, including creating initial rules and certificates for inbound and outbound traffic.
New/modified screens:
Add or edit a decryption policy: Policies > Access Control > Decryption.
Use a decryption policy: Decryption Policy Settings in an access control policy's advanced settings.
For more information, see Decryption Policies in the device configuration guide.
Improvements to TLS server identity discovery with Snort 3 devices.
We now support improved performance and inspection with the TLS server identity discovery feature, which allows you to handle traffic encrypted with TLS 1.3 with information from the server certificate. Although we recommend you leave it enabled, you can disable this feature using the new Enable adaptive TLS server identity probe option in the decryption policy's advanced settings.
For more information, see TLS 1.3 Decryption Best Practices in the device configuration guide.
URL filtering using cloud lookup results only.
When you enable (or re-enable) URL filtering, the management center automatically queries Cisco for URL category and reputation data and pushes the dataset to managed devices. You now have more options on how the system uses this dataset to filter web traffic.
To do this, we replaced the Query Cisco Cloud for Unknown URLs options with three new options:
Local Database Only: Uses the local URL dataset only. Use this option if you do not want to submit your uncategorized URLs (category and reputation not in the local dataset) to Cisco, for example, for privacy reasons. However, note that connections to uncategorized URLs do not match rules with category or reputation-based URL conditions. You cannot assign categories or reputations to URLs manually.
For upgraded management centers, this option is enabled if the old Query Cisco Cloud for Unknown URLs was disabled.
Local Database and Cisco Cloud: Uses the local dataset when possible, which can make web browsing faster. When users browse to an URL whose category and reputation is not in the local dataset or a cache of previously accessed websites, the system submits it to the cloud for threat intelligence evaluation and adds the result to the cache.
For upgraded management centers, this option is enabled if the old Query Cisco Cloud for Unknown URLs option was enabled.
Cisco Cloud Only: Does not use the local dataset. When users browse to an URL whose category and reputation is not in a local cache of previously accessed websites, the system submits it to the cloud for threat intelligence evaluation and adds the result to the cache. This option guarantees the most up-to-date category and reputation information.
This option is the default on new and reimaged Version 7.3+ management centers. Note that it also requires threat defense Version 7.3+. If you enable this option, devices running earlier versions use the Local Database and Cisco Cloud option.
New/modified screens: Integration > Other Integrations > Cloud Services > URL Filtering
For more information, see URL Filtering Options in the device configuration guide.
Detect HTTP/3 and SMB over QUIC using EVE (Snort 3 only).
Snort 3 devices can now use the encrypted visibility engine (EVE) to detect HTTP/3 and SMB over QUIC. You can then create rules to handle traffic based on these applications.
For more information, see Encrypted Visibility Engine in the device configuration guide.
Generate IoC events based on unsafe client applications detected by EVE (Snort 3 only).
Snort 3 devices can now generate indications of compromise (IoC) connection events based unsafe client applications detected by the encrypted visibility engine (EVE). These connection events have a Encrypted Visibility Threat Confidence of Very High.
View IoCs in the event viewer: Analysis > Hosts/Users > Indications of Compromise
View IoCs in the network map: Analysis > Hosts > Indications of Compromise
View IoC information in connection events: Analysis > Connections > Events > Table View of Connection Events > IOC/Encrypted Visibility columns
For more information, see Encrypted Visibility Engine in the device configuration guide.
Improved JavaScript inspection for Snort 3 devices.
We improved JavaScript inspection, which is done by normalizing the JavaScript and matching rules against the normalized content. The normalizer introduced in Version 7.2 now allows you to inspect within the unescape, decodeURI, and decodeURIComponent functions: %XX, %uXXXX, \uXX, \u{XXXX}\xXX, decimal code point, and hexadecimal code point. It also removes plus operations from strings and concatenates them.
For more information, see HTTP Inspect Inspector in the Snort 3 Inspector Reference, as well as the Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center Snort 3 Configuration Guide.
Nested rule groups, including MITRE ATT&CK, in Snort 3 intrusion policies.
You can now nest rule groups in a Snort 3 intrusion policy. This allows you to view and handle traffic in a more granular fashion; for example, you might group rules by vulnerability type, target system, or threat category. You can create custom nested rule groups and change the security level and rule action per rule group.
We also group system-provided rules in a Talos-curated MITRE ATT&CK framework, so you can act on traffic based on those categories.
New/modified screens:
View and use rule groups: Policies > Intrusion > Edit Snort 3 Version
View rule group information in the classic event view: Analysis > Intrusion > Events > Table View of Intrusion Events > Rule Group and MITRE ATT&CK columns
View rule group information in the unified event view: Analysis > Unified Events > Rule Group and MITRE ATT&CK columns
For more information, see the Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center Snort 3 Configuration Guide.
Access control rule conflict analysis.
You can now enable rule conflict analysis to help identify redundant rules and objects, and shadowed rules that cannot be matched due to previous rules in the policy.
For more information, see Analyzing Rule Conflicts and Warnings in the device configuration guide.
Event Logging and Analysis
NetFlow support for Snort 3 devices.
Upgrade impact.
Snort 3 devices now can consume NetFlow records (IPv4 and IPv6, NetFlow v5 and v9). Previously, only Snort 2 devices did this.
After upgrade, if you have an existing NetFlow exporter and NetFlow rule configured in the network discovery policy, Snort 3 devices may begin processing NetFlow records, generating NetFlow connection events, and adding host and application protocol information to the database based on NetFlow data.
For more information, see Network Discovery Policies in the device configuration guide.
Integrations
New remediation module for integration with the Cisco ACI Endpoint Update App
We introduced a new Cisco ACI Endpoint remediation module. To use it, you must remove the old module then add and configure the new one. This new module can:
Quarantine endpoints in an endpoint security group (ESG) deployment.
Allow traffic from a quarantined endpoint to a Layer 3 outside network (L3Out) for monitoring and analysis.
Run in audit-only mode, where it notifies you instead of quarantining.
For more information, see APIC/Secure Firewall Remediation Module 3.0 in the device configuration guide.
Health Monitoring
Cluster health monitor settings in the management center web interface.
You can now use the management center web interface to edit cluster health monitor settings. If you configured these settings with FlexConfig in a previous version, the system allows you to deploy, but also warns you to redo your configurations—the FlexConfig settings take precedence.
New/modified screens: Devices > Device Management > Edit Cluster > Cluster Health Monitor Settings
For more information, see Edit Cluster Health Monitor Settings in the device configuration guide.
Improved health monitoring for device clusters.
We added cluster dashboards to the health monitor where you can view overall cluster status, load distribution metrics, performance metrics, cluster control link (CCL) and data throughput, and so on.
To view the dashboard for each cluster, choose System () > Health > Monitor, then click the cluster.
For more information, see Cluster Health Monitor in the administration guide.
Monitor fan speed and temperature for the power supply on the hardware management center.
We added the Hardware Statistics health module that monitors fan speed and temperature for the power supply on the hardware management center. The upgrade process automatically adds and enables this module. After upgrade, apply the policy.
To enable or disable the module and set threshold values, edit the management center health policy on System () > Health > Policy.
To view health status, create a custom health dashboard: System () > Health > Monitor > Firewall Management Center > Add/Edit. Select the Hardware Statistics metric group, then select the metric you want.
You can also view module status on the health monitor's Home page and in the management center's alert summary (as Hardware Alarms and Power Supply). You can configure external alert responses and view health events based on module status.
For more information, see Hardware Statistics on Management Center in the administration guide.
Monitor temperature and power supply for the Firepower 4100/9300.
We added the Chassis Environment Status health module to monitor the temperature and power supply on a Firepower 4100/9300 chassis. The upgrade process automatically adds and enables these modules in all device health policies. After upgrade, apply health policies to Firepower 4100/9300 chassis to begin monitoring.
To enable or disable this module and set threshold values, edit the management center health policy: System () > Health > Policy > Device Policy.
To view health status, create a custom health dashboard: System () > Health > Monitor > Select Device > Add/Edit Dashboard > Custom Correlation Group. Select the Hardware/Environment Status metric group, then select the Thermal Status metric to view temperature or select any of the Power Supply options to view power supply status.
You can also view module status on the health monitor's Home page and in each device's alert summary. You can configure external alert responses and view health events based on module status.
For more information, see Hardware/Environment Status Metrics in the administration guide.
Licensing
Changes to license names and support for the Carrier license.
We renamed licenses as follows:
Base is now Essentials
Threat is now IPS
Malware is now Malware Defense
RA VPN/AnyConnect License is now Cisco Secure Client
AnyConnect Plus is now Secure Client Advantage
AnyConnect Apex is now Secure Client Premier
AnyConnect Apex and Plus is now Secure Client Premier and Advantage
AnyConnect VPN Only is now Secure Client VPN Only
In addition, you can now apply the Carrier license, which allows you to configure GTP/GPRS, Diameter, SCTP, and M3UA inspections.
New/modified screens: System () > Licenses > Smart Licenses
For more information, see Licenses in the administration guide.
Administration
Migrate configurations from FlexConfig to web interface management.
You can now easily migrate these configurations from FlexConfig to web interface management:
ECMP zones, supported in the Version 7.1+ web interface
EIGRP routing, supported in the Version 7.2+ web interface
VXLAN interfaces, supported in the Version 7.2+ web interface
After you migrate, you cannot deploy until you remove the deprecated FlexConfigs.
New/modified screens: Devices > FlexConfig > Edit FlexConfig Policy > Migrate Config
For more information, see Migrating FlexConfig Policies in the device configuration guide.
Automatic VDB downloads.
The initial setup on the management center schedules a weekly task to download the latest available software updates, which now includes the latest vulnerability database (VDB). We recommend you review this weekly task and adjust if necessary. Optionally, schedule a new weekly task to actually update the VDB and deploy configurations.
New/modified screens: The Vulnerability Database check box is now enabled by default in the system-created Weekly Software Download scheduled task.
For more information, see Vulnerability Database Update Automation in the administration guide.
Install any VDB.
Starting with VDB 357, you can now install any VDB as far back as the baseline VDB for that management center.
After you update the VDB, deploy configuration changes. If you based configurations on vulnerabilities, application detectors, or fingerprints that are no longer available, examine those configurations to make sure you are handling traffic as expected. Also, keep in mind a scheduled task to update the VDB can undo a rollback. To avoid this, change the scheduled task or delete any newer VDB packages.
New/modified screens: On System () > Updates > Product Updates > Available Updates, if you upload an older VDB, a new Rollback icon appears instead of the Install icon.
For more information, see Update the Vulnerability Database in the administration guide.
Automatically update CA bundles.
Upgrade impact. The system connects to Cisco for something new.
The local CA bundle contains certificates to access several Cisco services. The system now automatically queries Cisco for new CA certificates at a daily system-defined time. Previously, you had to upgrade the software to update CA certificates. You can use the CLI to disable this feature.
Note
  This feature is not supported in Version 7.0.0–7.0.4, 7.1.0–7.1.0.2, or 7.2.0–7.2.3. If you upgrade from a supported version to an unsupported version, the feature is temporarily disabled and the system stops contacting Cisco.
New/modified CLI commands: configure cert-update auto-update , configure cert-update run-now , configure cert-update test , show cert-update
For more information, see the Secure Firewall Management Center Command Line Reference in the management center administration guide, and the Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Command Reference.
Usability, Performance, and Troubleshooting
New how-to walkthroughs.
We added these how-tos:
Renew a certificate using manual re-enrollment.
Renew a certificate using Self-signed, SCEP, or EST enrollment.
Configure LDAP attribute map for remote access VPN.
Add SAML Single Sign-On server object.
Collect packet capture for threat defense device.
Collect packet trace to troubleshoot threat defense device.
Configure Dynamic Access Policy for remote access VPN.
Create a Dynamic Access Policy.
Create a Dynamic Access Policy record.
Associate Dynamic Access Policy with remote access VPN.
To launch a how-to, choose System () > How-Tos.
New access control policy user interface is now the default.
The access control policy user interface introduced in Version 7.2 is now the default interface. The upgrade switches you, but you can switch back.
Maximum objects per match criteria per access control rule is now 200.
We increased the objects per match criteria in a single access control rule from 50 to 200. For example, you can now use up to 200 network objects in a single access control rule.
Filter devices by version.
You can now filter devices by version on Devices > Device Management.
Better status emails for scheduled tasks.
Email notifications for scheduled tasks are now sent when the task completes—whether success or failure—instead of when the task begins. This means that they can now indicate whether the task failed or succeeded. For failures, they include the reason for the failure and remediations to fix the issue.
Performance profile for CPU core allocation.
You can adjust the percentage of system cores assigned to the data plane and Snort to adjust system performance. The adjustment is based on your relative use of VPN and intrusion policies. If you use both, leave the core allocation to the default values. If you use the system primarily for VPN (without applying intrusion policies), or as an IPS (with no VPN configuration), you can skew the core allocation to the data plane (for VPN) or Snort (for intrusion inspection).
We added the Performance Profile page to the platform settings policy.
For more information, see Configure the Performance Profile in the device configuration guide.
Additional telemetry sent to Cisco Success Network.
For improved serviceability, we now send the following data to the Cisco Success Network:
Device information, including how many devices are registered but are not being actively managed, whether your devices are configured for high availability/scalability, and how many nodes are in any configured cluster.
Event and network map information, including the number of hosts in your network map, intrusion event counts, and file/malware event counts.
You can change your Cisco Success Network enrollment at any time.
For more information, see Configure Cisco Success Network Enrollment in the administration guide.

New Features in Management Center Version 7.2
New Features
Table 4. New Features in Management Center Version 7.2.4
New Feature
Description
Default Forward Error Correction (FEC) on Secure Firewall 3100 fixed ports changed to Clause 108 RS-FEC from Clause 74 FC-FEC for 25 GB+ SR, CSR, and LR transceivers.
When you set the FEC to Auto on the Secure Firewall 3100 fixed ports, the default type is now set to Clause 108 RS-FEC instead of Clause 74 FC-FEC for 25 GB+ SR, CSR, and LR transceivers.
For more information on FEC, see Interface Overview in the device configuration guide.
Automatically update CA bundles.
Upgrade impact. The system connects to Cisco for something new.
The local CA bundle contains certificates to access several Cisco services. The system now automatically queries Cisco for new CA certificates at a daily system-defined time. Previously, you had to upgrade the software to update CA certificates. You can use the CLI to disable this feature.
Note
  This feature is not supported in Version 7.0.0–7.0.4, 7.1.0–7.1.0.2, or 7.2.0–7.2.3. If you upgrade from a supported version to an unsupported version, the feature is temporarily disabled and the system stops contacting Cisco.
New/modified CLI commands: configure cert-update auto-update , configure cert-update run-now , configure cert-update test , show cert-update
For more information, see the Secure Firewall Management Center Command Line Reference in the management center administration guide, and the Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Command Reference.
Access control performance improvements (object optimization).
Upgrade impact. First deployment after upgrade can take a long time and increase CPU use on the device.
Version 7.2.4 improves performance in deployments with access control rules that use overlapping networks. These configurations now consume fewer device resources due to optimization of overlapping objects.
The improvements take effect after the first post-upgrade deploy. However, if you have a high number of rules, the system can take several minutes to an hour to evaluate your policies and perform object optimization. During this time, you may also see higher CPU utilization on the device.
We strongly recommend you deploy when it will have the least impact, such as a maintenance window or a low-traffic time.
Note
  This feature is not supported in Version 7.3.

New Feature
Description
Platform
Management center virtual and threat defense virtual for Alibaba.
We introduced Secure Firewall Management Center Virtual and Secure Firewall Threat Defense for Alibaba. You must manage threat defense virtual for Alibaba with a management center; device manager is not supported.
Note that due to underlying issues in the Alibaba infrastructure, the threat defense virtual instance type ecs.g5ne.4xLarge has low performance, especially in terms of connections per second (CPS). We recommend the 2xlarge or 4xlarge.
Snapshots allow quick deploy of threat defense virtual for AWS and Azure.
You can now take a snapshot of a threat defense virtual for AWS or Azure instance, then use that snapshot to quickly deploy new instances. This feature also improves the performance of the autoscale solutions for AWS and Azure.
For more information, see the Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Virtual Getting Started Guide.
Analytics mode for cloud-managed threat defense devices.
Concurrently with Version 7.2, we introduced the Cisco Cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center. The cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center uses the Cisco Defense Orchestrator (CDO) platform and unites management across multiple Cisco security solutions. We take care of feature updates.
Customer-deployed hardware and virtual management centers running Version 7.2+ can "co-manage" cloud-managed threat defense devices, but for event logging and analytics purposes only. You cannot deploy policy to these devices from a customer-deployed management center.
New/modified screens:
When you add a cloud-managed device to a customer-deployed management center, use the new CDO Managed Device check box to specify that it is analytics-only.
View which devices are analytics-only on Devices > Device Management.
New/modified CLI commands: configure manager add , configure manager delete , configure manager edit , show managers
For more information, see Managing Firewall Threat Defense with Cloud-Delivered Firewall Management Center in Cisco Defense Orchestrator.

For more information, see Clustering for the Firepower 4100/9300 or Clustering for Threat Defense Virtual in a Public Cloud in the device configuration guide.
Autoscale for threat defense virtual for AWS gateway load balancers.
We now support autoscale for threat defense virtual for AWS gateway load balancers, using a CloudFormation template.
For more information, see the Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Virtual Getting Started Guide.
Autoscale for threat defense virtual for GCP.
We now support autoscale for threat defense virtual for GCP, by positioning a threat defense virtual instance group between a GCP internal load balancer (ILB) and a GCP external load balancer (ELB).
For more information, see the Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Virtual Getting Started Guide.
Interfaces
LLDP support for the Firepower 2100 and Secure Firewall 3100.
You can now enable Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) for Firepower 2100 and Secure Firewall 3100 series interfaces.
New/modified screens: Devices > Device Management > Interfaces > > Hardware Configuration > LLDP
New/modified commands: show lldp status , show lldp neighbors , show lldp statistics
For more information, see Interface Overview in the device configuration guide.
Pause frames for flow control for the Secure Firewall 3100.
If you have a traffic burst, dropped packets can occur if the burst exceeds the buffering capacity of the FIFO buffer on the NIC and the receive ring buffers. Enabling pause frames for flow control can alleviate this issue.
New/modified screens: Devices > Device Management > Interfaces > Hardware Configuration > Network Connectivity
For more information, see Interface Overview in the device configuration guide.
Breakout ports for the Secure Firewall 3130 and 3140.
You can now configure four 10 GB breakout ports for each 40 GB interface on the Secure Firewall 3130 and 3140.
New/modified screens: Devices > Device Management > Chassis Operations
For more information, see Interface Overview in the device configuration guide.
Configure VXLAN from the management center web interface.
You can now use the management center web interface to configure VXLAN interfaces. VXLANs act as Layer 2 virtual network over a Layer 3 physical network to stretch the Layer 2 network.
If you configured VXLAN interfaces with FlexConfig in a previous version, they continue to work. In fact, FlexConfig takes precedence in this case—if you redo your VXLAN configurations in the web interface, remove the FlexConfig settings.
New/modified screens:
Configure the VTEP source interface: Devices > Device Management > VTEP
Configure the VNI interface: Devices > Device Management > Interfaces > Add VNI Interface
For more information, see Regular Firewall Interfaces in the device configuration guide.
NAT
Ability to enable, disable, or delete more than one NAT rule at a time.
You can select multiple NAT rules and enable, disable, or delete them all at the same time. Enable and disable apply to manual NAT rules only, whereas delete applies to any NAT rule.
For more information, see Network Address Translation in the device configuration guide.
VPN
Certificate and SAML authentication for RA VPN connection profiles.
We now support certificate and SAML authentication for RA VPN connection profiles. You can authenticate a machine certificate or user certificate before a SAML authentication/authorization is initiated. This can be done using DAP certificate attributes along with user specific SAML DAP attributes.
New/modified screens: You can now choose Certificate & SAML option when choosing the authentication method for the connection profile in an RA VPN policy.
For more information, see Remote Access VPN in the device configuration guide.
Route-based site-to-site VPN with hub and spoke topology.
We added support for route-based site-to-site VPNs in a hub and spoke topology. Previously, that topology only supported policy-based (crypto map) VPNs.
New/modified screens: When you add a new VPN topology and choose Route Based (VTI), you can now also choose Hub and Spoke.
For more information, see Site-to-Site VPNs in the device configuration guide.
IPsec flow offload for the Secure Firewall 3100.
On the Secure Firewall 3100, IPsec flows are offloaded by default. After the initial setup of an IPsec site-to-site VPN or remote access VPN security association (SA), IPsec connections are offloaded to the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) in the device, which should improve device performance.
You can change the configuration using FlexConfig and the flow-offload-ipsec command.
For more information, see Site-to-Site VPNs in the device configuration guide.
Routing
Configure EIGRP from the management center web interface.
You can now use the management center web interface to configure EIGRP. Note that you can only enable EIGRP on interfaces belonging to the device's Global virtual router.
If you configured EIGRP with FlexConfig in a previous version, the system allows you to deploy post-upgrade, but also warns you to redo your EIGRP configurations in the web interface. When you are satisfied with the new configuration, you can delete the deprecated FlexConfig objects or commands. To help you with this process, we provide a command-line migration tool.
New/modified screens: Devices > Device Management > Routing > EIGRP
For more information, see EIGRP and Migrating FlexConfig Policies in the device configuration guide.
Virtual router support for the Firepower 1010.
You can now configure up to five virtual routers on the Firepower 1010.
For more information, see Virtual Routers in the device configuration guide.
Support for VTIs in user-defined virtual routers.
You can now assign virtual tunnel interfaces to user-defined virtual routers. Previously, you could only assign VTIs to Global virtual routers.
New/modified screens: Devices > Device Management > Routing > Virtual Router Properties
For more information, see Virtual Routers in the device configuration guide.
Policy-based routing with path monitoring.
You can now use path monitoring to collect the performance metrics (RTT, jitter, packet-lost, and MOS) of a device's egress interfaces. Then, you can use these metrics to determine the best path for policy based routing.
New/modified screens:
Enable path monitoring and choose metrics to collect: Devices > Device Management > Interfaces > Path Monitoring
Use the new Interface Ordering option when you are adding a policy based route and specifying a forwarding action: Devices > Device Management > Routing > Policy Based Routing
Monitor path metrics in each device's health monitoring dashboard: System () > Health > Monitor > add dashboard > Interface - Path Metrics.
New/modified CLI commands: show policy route , show path-monitoring , clear path-monitoring
For more information, see Policy Based Routing in the device configuration guide.
Threat Intelligence
DNS-based threat intelligence from Cisco Umbrella.
We now support DNS-based Security Intelligence using regularly updated information from Cisco Umbrella. You can use both a local DNS policy and an Umbrella DNS policy, for two layers of protection.
New/modified screens:
Configure connection to Umbrella: Integration > Other Integrations > Cloud Services > Cisco Umbrella Connection
Configure Umbrella DNS policy: Policies > DNS > Add DNS Policy > Umbrella DNA Policy
Associate Umbrella DNS policy with access control: Policies > Access Control > Edit Policy > Security Intelligence > Umbrella DNS Policy
For more information, see DNS Policies in the device configuration guide.
IP-based threat intelligence from Amazon GuardDuty.
You can now handle traffic based on malicious IP addresses detected by Amazon GuardDuty, when integrated with management center virtual for AWS. The system consumes this threat intelligence via a custom Security Intelligence feed, or via a regularly updated network object group, which you can then use in your security policies.
For more information, see the Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Virtual Getting Started Guide.
Access Control and Threat Detection
Dynamic object management with:
Cloud-delivered Cisco Secure Dynamic Attributes Connector
On-prem Cisco Secure Dynamic Attributes Connector 2.0
Concurrently with Version 7.2, we released the following updates to the Cisco Secure Dynamic Attributes Connector:
Cloud-delivered Cisco Secure Dynamic Attributes Connector (CDO-managed service)
Supported management centers: Version 7.1+ and the cloud-delivered management center.
Supported virtual/cloud workloads: AWS, Azure, Azure service tags, Google Cloud Connector, GitHub, and Office 365.
For more information: Managing the Cisco Secure Dynamic Attributes Connector with Cisco Defense Orchestrator chapters in Managing Firewall Threat Defense with Cloud-Delivered Firewall Management Center in Cisco Defense Orchestrator.

Supported management centers: Version 7.0+ and the cloud-delivered management center.
Supported virtual/cloud workloads: AWS, Azure, Azure service tags, Google Cloud Connector, GitHub, Office 365, and VMware.
For more information: Cisco Secure Dynamic Attributes Connector Configuration Guide 2.0.
Bypass inspection or throttle elephant flows on Snort 3 devices.
You can now detect and optionally bypass inspection or throttle elephant flows. By default, access control policies are set to generate an event when the system sees an unencrypted connection larger than 1 GB/10 sec; the rate limit is configurable.
For the Firepower 2100 series, you can detect elephant flows but not bypass inspection or throttle. For devices running Snort 2 and for devices running Version 7.1 and earlier, continue to use Intelligent Application Bypass (IAB).
New/modified screens: We added Elephant Flow Settings to the access control policy's Advanced tab.
For more information, see Elephant Flow Detection in the device configuration guide.
Encrypted visibility engine enhancements for Snort 3 devices.
We made the following enhancements to the encrypted visibility engine (EVE):
EVE can detect the operating system used by the host, which is reported in events and the network map.
EVE can detect application traffic by assigning EVE processes that were identified with high confidence to applications, which you can then use in access control rules to control network traffic. (In Version 7.1, you could see EVE processes for connections, but you could not act on that knowledge.)
To add additional assignments, create custom applications/custom application detectors. When adding a detection pattern to your custom detector, choose Encrypted Visibility Engine as the application. Then, specify the process name and confidence level.
EVE now works with QUIC traffic.
The following connection event fields have changed along with these enhancements:
TLS Fingerprint Process Name
is now
Encrypted Visibility Process Name
TLS Fingerprint Process Confidence Score
is now
Encrypted Visibility Process Confidence Score
TLS Fingerprint Malware Confidence
is now
Encrypted Visibility Threat Confidence
TLS Fingerprint Malware Confidence Score
is now
Encrypted Visibility Threat Confidence Score
Detection Type: TLS Fingerprint
is now
Detection Type: Encrypted Visibility
This feature now requires a Threat license.
For more information, see Access Control Policies and Application Detection in the device configuration guide.
TLS 1.3 inspection for Snort 3 devices.
We now support inspection of TLS 1.3 traffic.
New/modified screens: We added the Enable TLS 1.3 Decryption option to the Advanced Settings tab in SSL policies. Note that this option is disabled by default.
For more information, see SSL Policies in the device configuration guide.
Improved portscan detection for Snort 3 devices.
With an improved portscan detector, you can easily configure the system to detect or prevent portscans. You can refine the networks you want to protect, set the sensitivity, and so on. For devices running Snort 2 and for devices running Version 7.1 and earlier, continue to use the network analysis policy for portscan detection.
New/modified screens: We added Threat Detection to the access control policy's Advanced tab.
For more information, see Threat Detection in the device configuration guide.
VBA macro inspection for Snort 3 devices.
We now support inspection of VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macros in Microsoft Office documents, which is done by decompressing the macros and matching rules against the decompressed content.
By default, VBA macro decompression is disabled in all system-provided network analysis policies. To enable it use the decompress_vba setting in the imap, smtp, http_inspect, and pop Snort 3 inspectors.
To configure custom intrusion rules to match against decompressed macros, use the vba_data option.
For more information, see the appropriate chapters in the Snort 3 Inspector Reference, as well as the Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center Snort 3 Configuration Guide.
Improved JavaScript inspection for Snort 3 devices.
We improved JavaScript inspection, which is done by normalizing the JavaScript and matching rules against the normalized content. A new normalizer's enhancements include improved white-space normalization, semicolon insertions, cross-site script handling, identifier normalization and dealiasing, just-in-time (JIT) inspection, and the ability to inspect external scripts.
By default, the new normalizer is enabled in all system-provided network analysis policies. To tweak performance or disable the feature in a custom network analysis policy, use the js_norm (improved normalizer) and normalize_javascript (legacy normalizer) settings in the https_inspect Snort 3 inspector.
To configure custom intrusion rules to match against normalized JavaScript, use the js_data option, for example:
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"Script detected!"; 
js_data; content:"var var_0000=1;"; sid:1000001;)
For more information, see HTTP Inspect Inspector in the Snort 3 Inspector Reference, as well as the Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center Snort 3 Configuration Guide.
Improved SMB 3 inspection for Snort 3 devices.
We now support inspection of SMB 3 traffic in the following situations:
During file server node failover for clusters configured for SMB Transparent Failover.
In multiple file server nodes for clusters using SMB Scale-Out.
Through directory information changes due to SMB Directory Leasing.
Spread across multiple connections due to SMB Multichannel.
For more information, see the Snort 3 Inspector Reference and the Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center Snort 3 Configuration Guide.
Policy Management
Access control policy locking.
You can now lock an access control policy to prevent other administrators from editing it. Locking the policy ensures that your changes will not be invalidated if another administrator edits the policy and saves changes before you save your changes. Any user who has permission to modify the access control policy has permission to lock it.
We added an icon to lock or unlock a policy next to the policy name while editing the policy. In addition, there is a new permission to allow users to unlock policies locked by other administrators: Override Access Control Policy Lock. This permission is enabled by default in the Administrator, Access Admin, and Network Admin roles.
For more information, see Access Control Policies in the device configuration guide.
Object group search is enabled by default.
Upgrade Impact
The Object Group Search setting is now enabled by default. Upgrading to Version 7.2+ enables this setting.
New/modified screens: Devices > Device Management > Device > Advanced Settings
For more information, see Device Management in the device configuration guide.
Access control rule hit counts persist over reboot.
Rebooting a managed device no longer resets access control rule hit counts to zero. Hit counts are reset only if you actively clear the counters. In addition, counts are maintained by each unit in an HA pair or cluster separately. You can use the show rule hits command to see cumulative counters across the HA pair or cluster, or see the counts per node.
New/modified CLI commands: show rule hits
For more information, see the Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Command Reference
Usability improvements for the access control policy.
There is a new user interface available for the access control policy. You can continue to use the legacy user interface, or you can try out the new user interface.
The new interface has both a table and a grid view for the rules list, the ability to show or hide columns, enhanced search, infinite scroll, a clearer view of the packet flow related to policies associated with the access control policy, and a simplified add/edit dialog box for creating rules. You can freely switch back and forth between the legacy and new user interfaces while editing an access control policy.
For more information, see Access Control Policies in the device configuration guide.
Event Logging and Analysis
Improved SecureX integration, SecureX orchestration.
We have streamlined the SecureX integration process. Now, as long as you already have a SecureX account, you just choose your cloud region on the new Integration > SecureX page, click Enable SecureX, and authenticate to SecureX. The option to send events to the cloud, as well as to enable Cisco Success Network and Cisco Support Diagnostics, are also moved to this new page.
When you enable SecureX integration on this new page, licensing and management for the system's cloud connection switches from Cisco Smart Licensing to SecureX. If you already enabled SecureX the "old" way, you must disable and re-enable to get the benefits of this cloud connection management.
Note that this page also governs the cloud region for and event types sent to the Secure Network Analytics (Stealthwatch) cloud using Security Analytics and Logging (SaaS), even though the web interface does not indicate this. Previously, these options were on System () > Integration > Cloud Services. Enabling SecureX does not affect communications with the Secure Network Analytics cloud; you can send events to both.
The management center also now supports SecureX orchestration—a powerful drag-and-drop interface you can use to automate workflows across security tools. After you enable SecureX, you can enable orchestration.
As part of this feature, you can no longer use the REST API to configure SecureX integration. You must use the FMC web interface.
This feature was introduced Version 7.0.2 and temporarility deprecated in Version 7.1.
For more information, see the Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (7.0.2 and 7.2) and SecureX Integration Guide.
Log security events to multiple Secure Network Analytics on-prem data stores.
When you configure a Secure Network Analytics Data Store (multi-node) integration, you can now add multiple flow collectors for security events. You assign each flow collector to one or more threat defense devices running Version 7.0+.
New/modified screens:
Setup: Integration > Security Analytics & Logging > Secure Network Analytics Data Store
Modify: Integration > Security Analytics & Logging > Update Device Assignments
This feature requires Secure Network Analytics Version 7.1.4.
For more information, see the Cisco Security Analytics and Logging (On Premises): Firewall Event Integration Guide.
Database access changes.
We added ten new tables, deprecated one table, and prohibited joins in six tables. We also added fields to various tables for Snort 3 support and to provide timestamps and IP addresses in human-readable format.
For more information, see the What's New topic in the Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center Database Access Guide, Version 7.2.
eStreamer changes.
A new Python-based reference client has been added to the SDK. Also, you can now request fully qualified events.
For more information, see the What's New topic in the Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center Event Streamer Integration Guide, Version 7.2.
Upgrade
Copy upgrade packages ("peer-to-peer sync") from device to device.
Instead of copying upgrade packages to each device from the management center or internal web server, you can use the threat defense CLI to copy upgrade packages between devices ("peer to peer sync"). This secure and reliable resource-sharing goes over the management network but does not rely on the management center. Each device can accommodate 5 package concurrent transfers.
This feature is supported for Version 7.2+ standalone devices managed by the same standalone management center. It is not supported for:
Container instances.
Device high availability pairs and clusters.
These devices get the package from each other as part of their normal sync process. Copying the upgrade package to one group member automatically syncs it to all group members.
Devices managed by high availability management centers.
Devices managed by the cloud-delivered management center, but added to a customer-deployed management center in analytics mode.
Devices in different domains, or devices separated by a NAT gateway.
Devices upgrading from Version 7.1 or earlier, regardless of management center version.
New/modified CLI commands: configure p2psync enable , configure p2psync disable , show peers , show peer details , sync-from-peer , show p2p-sync-status
Minimum threat defense: 7.2
For more information, see Copy Threat Defense Upgrade Packages between Devices in the management center upgrade guide.
Auto-upgrade to Snort 3 after successful threat defense upgrade.
When you use a Version 7.2+ management center to upgrade threat defense, you can now choose whether to Upgrade Snort 2 to Snort 3.
After the software upgrade, eligible devices will upgrade from Snort 2 to Snort 3 when you deploy configurations. For devices that are ineligible because they use custom intrusion or network analysis policies, we strongly recommend you manually upgrade to Snort 3 for improved detection and performance. For migration assistance, see the Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center Snort 3 Configuration Guide for your version.
This option is supported for major and maintenance threat defense upgrades to Version 7.2+. It is not supported for threat defense upgrades to Version 7.0 or 7.1, or for patches to any version.
Upgrade for single-node clusters.
You can now use the device upgrade page (Devices > Device Upgrade) to upgrade clusters with only one active node. Any deactivated nodes are also upgraded. Previously, this type of upgrade would fail. This feature is not supported from the system updates page (System > Updates).
Hitless upgrades are also not supported in this case. Interruptions to traffic flow and inspection depend on the interface configurations of the lone active unit, just as with standalone devices.
Supported platforms: Firepower 4100/9300, Secure Firewall 3100
Revert threat defense upgrades from the CLI.
You can now revert threat defense upgrades from the device CLI if communications between the management center and device are disrupted. Note that in high availability/scalability deployments, revert is more successful when all units are reverted simultaneously. When reverting with the CLI, open sessions with all units, verify that revert is possible on each, then start the processes at the same time.
Caution
  Reverting from the CLI can cause configurations between the device and the management center to go out of sync, depending on what you changed post-upgrade. This can cause further communication and deployment issues.
New/modified CLI commands: upgrade revert , show upgrade revert-info .
Minimum threat defense: 7.2
For more information, see Revert the Upgrade in the management center upgrade guide.
Administration & Troubleshooting
Dropped packet statistics for the Secure Firewall 3100.
The new show packet-statistics threat defense CLI command displays comprehensive information about non-policy related packet drops. Previously this information required using several commands.
For more information, see the Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Command Reference.
Multiple DNS server groups for resolving DNS requests.
You can configure multiple DNS groups for the resolution of DNS requests from client systems. You can use these DNS server groups to resolve requests for different DNS domains. For example, you could have a catch-all default group that uses public DNS servers, for use with connections to the Internet. You could then configure a separate group to use internal DNS servers for internal traffic, for example, any connection to a machine in the example.com domain. Thus, connections to an FQDN using your organization’s domain name would be resolved using your internal DNS servers, whereas connections to public servers use external DNS servers.
New/modified screens: Platform Settings > DNS
For more information, see Platform Settings in the device configuration guide.
Configure certificate validation with threat defense by usage type.
You can now specify the usage types where validation is allowed with the trustpoint (the threat defense device): IPsec client connections, SSL client connections, and SSL server certificates.
New/modified screens: We added a Validation Usage option to certificate enrollment objects: Objects > Object Manager > PKI > Cert Enrollment.
For more information, see Object Management in the device configuration guide.
Auto rollback of a deployment that causes a loss of management connectivity.
You can now enable auto rollback of the configuration if a deployment causes the management connection between the management center and the threat defense to go down. Previously, you could only manually rollback a configuration using the configure policy rollback command.

For more information, see Configuration Deployment in the device configuration guide.
GeoDB is split into two packages.
In May 2022, shortly before the Version 7.2 release, we split the GeoDB into two packages: a country code package that maps IP addresses to countries/continents, and an IP package that contains additional contextual data associated with routable IP addresses. The contextual data in the IP package can include additional location details, as well as connection information such as ISP, connection type, proxy type, domain name, and so on.
If your Version 7.2+ management center has internet access and you enable recurring updates or you manually kick off a one-time update from the Cisco Support & Download site, the system automatically obtains and imports both packages. However, if you manually download updates—for example, in an air-gapped deployment—make sure you get and import both GeoDB packages:
Country code package: Cisco_GEODB_Update-date-build.sh.REL.tar
IP package: Cisco_IP_GEODB_Update-date-build.sh.REL.tar
The Geolocation Updates (System () > Updates > Geolocation Updates) page and the About page (Help > About) list the versions of the packages currently being used by the system.
For more information, see Updates in the management center admin guide.
French language option for web interface.
You can now switch the management center web interface to French.
New/modified screens: System () > Configuration > Language
For more information, see System Configuration in the management center admin guide.

Management Center REST API
Management center REST API services/operations.
For information on changes to the FMC REST API, see What's New in 7.2 in the REST API quick start guide.
Deprecated Features
Table 8. Deprecated Features in Management Center Version 7.2.0
Deprecated Feature
Description
Deprecated: EIGRP with FlexConfig.
You can now configure EIGRP routing from the management center web interface.
You no longer need these FlexConfig objects: Eigrp_Configure, Eigrp_Interface_Configure, Eigrp_Unconfigure, Eigrp_Unconfigure_all.
And these associated text objects: eigrpAS, eigrpNetworks, eigrpDisableAutoSummary, eigrpRouterId, eigrpStubReceiveOnly, eigrpStubRedistributed, eigrpStubConnected, eigrpStubStatic, eigrpStubSummary, eigrpIntfList, eigrpAS, eigrpAuthKey, eigrpAuthKeyId, eigrpHelloInterval, eigrpHoldTime, eigrpDisableSplitHorizon.
The system does allow you to deploy post-upgrade, but also warns you to redo your EIGRP configurations. To help you with this process, we provide a command-line migration tool. For details, see Migrating FlexConfig Policies in the device configuration guide.
Deprecated: VXLAN with FlexConfig.
You can now configure VXLAN interfaces from the management center web interface.
You no longer need these FlexConfig objects: VxLAN_Clear_Nve, VxLAN_Clear_Nve_Only, VxLAN_Configure_Port_And_Nve, VxLAN_Make_Nve_Only, VxLAN_Make_Vni.
And these associated text objects: vxlan_Port_And_Nve, vxlan_Nve_Only, vxlan_Vni.
If you configured VXLAN interfaces with FlexConfig in a previous version, they continue to work. In fact, FlexConfig takes precedence in this case—if you redo your VXLAN configurations in the web interface, remove the FlexConfig settings.
Deprecated: Automatic pre-upgrade troubleshooting.
To save time and disk space, the management center upgrade process no longer automatically generates troubleshooting files before the upgrade begins. Note that device upgrades are unaffected and continue to generate troubleshooting files.
To manually generate troubleshooting files for the management center, choose System () > Health > Monitor, click Firewall Management Center in the left panel, then View System & Troubleshoot Details, then Generate Troubleshooting Files.
New Features in FMC Version 7.1
New Features
Table 9. New Features in FMC Version 7.1 Patches
New Feature
Description
Version 7.1.0.3
Automatically update CA bundles.
Upgrade impact. The system connects to Cisco for something new.
The local CA bundle contains certificates to access several Cisco services. The system now automatically queries Cisco for new CA certificates at a daily system-defined time. Previously, you had to upgrade the software to update CA certificates. You can use the CLI to disable this feature.
Note
  This feature is not supported in Version 7.0.0–7.0.4, 7.1.0–7.1.0.2, or 7.2.0–7.2.3. If you upgrade from a supported version to an unsupported version, the feature is temporarily disabled and the system stops contacting Cisco.
New/modified CLI commands: configure cert-update auto-update , configure cert-update run-now , configure cert-update test , show cert-update
For more information, see the Firepower Management Center Command Line Reference in the management center administration guide, and the Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Command Reference.
Table 10. New Features in FMC Version 7.1.0
New Feature
Description
Platform
Secure Firewall 3100
We introduced the Secure Firewall 3110, 3120, 3130, and 3140.
You can hot swap a network module of the same type while the firewall is powered up without having to reboot; making other module changes requires a reboot. Secure Firewall 3100 25 Gbps interfaces support Forward Error Correction as well as speed detection based on the SFP installed. The SSDs are self-encrypting drives (SEDs), and if you have 2 SSDs, they form a software RAID. These devices support up to 8 units for Spanned EtherChannel clustering.
Note that the Version 7.1.0 release does not include online help for these devices; new online help is included in Version 7.1.0.2.

FMCv300 for AWS
FMCv300 for OCI
We introduced the FMCv300 for both AWS and OCI. The FMCv300 can manage up to 300 devices.
FTDv for AWS instances.
FTDv for AWS adds support for these instances:
c5a.xlarge, c5a.2xlarge, c5a.4xlarge
c5ad.xlarge, c5ad.2xlarge, c5ad.4xlarge
c5d.xlarge, c5d.2xlarge, c5d.4xlarge

Standard_D16s_v3
Standard_F8s_v2
Standard_F16s_v2
Use FDM to configure the FTD for management by the FMC.
When you perform initial setup using FDM, all interface configuration completed in FDM is retained when you switch to FMC for management, in addition to the Management and FMC access settings. Note that other default configuration settings, such as the access control policy or security zones, are not retained. When you use the FTD CLI, only the Management and FMC access settings are retained (for example, the default inside interface configuration is not retained).
After you switch to FMC, you can no longer use FDM to manage the FTD.
New/modified FDM screens: System Settings > Management Center
Device Upgrade
Revert a successful device upgrade.
You can now revert major and maintenance upgrades to FTD. Reverting returns the software to its state just before the last upgrade, also called a snapshot. If you revert an upgrade after installing a patch, you revert the patch as well as the major and/or maintenance upgrade.
Important
  If you think you might need to revert, you must use System () > Updates to upgrade FTD. The System Updates page is the only place you can enable the Enable revert after successful upgrade option, which configures the system to save a revert snapshot when you initiate the upgrade. This is in contrast to our usual recommendation to use the wizard on the Devices > Device Upgrade page.
This feature is not supported for container instances.
Minimum FTD: 7.1
Improvements to the upgrade workflow for clustered and high availability devices.
We made the following improvements to the upgrade workflow for clustered and high availability devices:
The upgrade wizard now correctly displays clustered and high availability units as groups, rather than as individual devices. The system can identify, report, and preemptively require fixes for group-related issues you might have. For example, you cannot upgrade a cluster on the Firepower 4100/9300 if you have made unsynced changes on Firepower Chassis Manager.
We improved the speed and efficiency of copying upgrade packages to clusters and high availability pairs. Previously, the FMC copied the package to each group member sequentially. Now, group members can get the package from each other as part of their normal sync process.
You can now specify the upgrade order of data units in a cluster. The control unit always upgrades last.
Snort 3 backwards compatibility.
For Snort 3, new features and resolved bugs require that you fully upgrade the FMC and its managed devices. Unlike Snort 2, you cannot update the inspection engine on an older device (for example, Version 7.0) by deploying from a newer FMC (for example, Version 7.1).
When you deploy to an older device, the system lists any unsupported configurations and warns you that they will be skipped. We recommend you always update your entire deployment.
Device Management
Geneve interface support for an FTDv on AWS instances.
Geneve encapsulation support was added to support single-arm proxy for the AWS Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB). The AWS GWLB combines a transparent network gateway (with a single entry and exit point for all traffic) and a load balancer that distributes traffic and scales FTDv to match the traffic demand.
This support requires FMC with Snort 3 enabled and is available on the following performance tiers:
FTDv20
FTDv30
FTDv50
FTDv100
Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) support for FTDv on OCI.
You can now implement Single Root Input/Output Virtualization (SR-IOV) for FTDv on OCI. SR-IOV can provide performance improvements for an FTDv. Mellanox 5 as vNICs are not supported in SR-IOV mode.
LLDP support for the Firepower 1100.
You can now enable Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) for Firepower 1100 interfaces.
New/modified screens: Devices > Device Management > Interfaces > Hardware Configuration > LLDP
New/modified commands: show lldp status , show lldp neighbors , show lldp statistics
Supported platforms: Firepower 1100 (1120, 1140, and 1150)
Interface auto-negotiation is now set independently from speed and duplex, interface sync improved.
Interface auto-negotiation is now set independently from speed and duplex. Also, when you sync the interfaces in FMC, hardware changes are detected more effectively.
New/modified screens: Devices > Device Management > Interfaces > Hardware Configuration > Speed
Supported platforms: Firepower 1000/2100, Secure Firewall 3100
Support to specify trusted DNS servers.
You can use FTD platform settings to specify trusted DNS servers for DNS snooping. This helps detect applications on the first packet by mapping domains to IP addresses. By default, trusted DNS servers include those in DNS server objects, and those discovered by dhcp-pool, dhcp-relay, and dhcp-client.
Import and export device configurations.
You can export the device-specific configuration, and you can then import the saved configuration for the same device in the following use cases:
Moving the device to a different FMC.
Restore an old configuration.
Reregistering a device.
New/modified screens: Devices > Device Management > Device > General
High Availability/Scalability
High availability for:
FMCv for AWS
FMCv for OCI
We now support high availability on FMCv for AWS and FMCv for OCI.
In an FTD deployment, you need two identically licensed FMCs, as well as one FTD entitlement for each managed device. For example, to manage 10 FTD devices with an FMCv10 high availability pair, you need two FMCv10 entitlements and 10 FTD entitlements. If you are managing Version 6.5.0–7.0.x Classic devices only (NGIPSv or ASA FirePOWER), you do not need FMCv entitlements.
Supported platforms: FMCv10, FMCv25, FMCv300 (not supported for FMCv2)
Autoscale on FTDv for OCI.
We now support autoscaling on FTDv for OCI.
The serverless infrastructure in cloud-based deployments allow you to automatically adjust the number of FTDv instances in an autoscale group based on capacity needs. This includes automatic registering/unregistering to and from the managing FMC.
Cluster deployment for firewall changes completes faster.
Cluster deployment for firewall changes now completes faster.
Supported platforms: Firepower 4100/9300, Secure Firewall 3100
Clearing routes in a high availability group or cluster.
In previous releases, the clear route command cleared the routing table on the unit only. Now, when operating in a high availability group or cluster, the command is available on the active or control unit only, and clears the routing table on all units in the group or cluster.
NAT
Manual NAT support for fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) objects as the translated destination.
You can use an FQDN network object, such as one specifying www.example.com, as the translated destination address in manual NAT rules. The system configures the rule based on the IP address returned from the DNS server.
Routing
BGP configuration to interconnect virtual routers.
You can configure BGP settings to dynamically leak routes among user-defined virtual routers, and between global virtual router and user-defined virtual routers. The import and export routes feature was introduced to exchange routes among the virtual routers by tagging them with route targets and optionally, filtering the matched routes with route maps. This BGP feature is accessible only when you select a user-defined virtual router.
New/modified screens: For a selected user-defined virtual router, Devices > Device Management > Routing > BGPv4/v6 > Route Import/Export
BGPv6 support for user-defined virtual routers.
FTD now supports configuring BGPv6 on user-defined virtual routers.
New/modified screens: For a selected user-defined virtual router, Devices > Device Management > Routing > BGPv6
Equal-Cost-Multi-Path (ECMP) zone support.
You can now group interfaces in traffic zones and configure Equal-Cost-Multi-Path (ECMP) routing in FMC.
ECMP routing was previously supported through FlexConfig policies.
New/modified screens: Devices > Device Management > Routing > ECMP
Direct Internet Access/Policy Based Routing
Direct internet access with policy based routing.
You can now configure policy based routing through the FMC to classify network traffic based on applications and to implement Direct Internet Access (DIA) to send traffic to the internet from a branch deployment. You can define a PBR policy and configure it on ingress interfaces, specifying match criteria and egress interfaces. Network traffic that matches the access control policy is forwarded through the egress interface based on priority or the order as configured in the policy.
New/modified screens: New policy page for configuring the policy based routing policy: Devices > Device Management > Routing > Policy Based Routing
Supported platforms: FTD
FMC REST API enhancements for direct internet access and policy based routing.
You can use the FMC REST API to configure Direct Internet Access through Policy Based Routing. The following enhancements have been made to the FMC REST API to support this:
New APIs were added to enable you to create, view, edit, and delete your Policy Based Routing configuration
New parameters added to existing APIs for Extended Access Control Lists to define applications
New parameters added to existing APIs for device interfaces to define interface priority
Remote Access VPN
Copy RA VPN policies.
You can now create a new RA VPN policy by copying an existing policy. We added a copy button next to each policy on Devices > VPN > Remote Access.
AnyConnect VPN SAML external browser.
You can now configure AnyConnect VPN SAML External Browser to enable additional authentication choices, such as passwordless authentication, WebAuthN, FIDO, SSO, U2F, and an improved SAML experience due to the persistence of cookies. When you use SAML as the primary authentication method for a remote access VPN connection profile, you can elect to have the AnyConnect client use the client’s local browser instead of the AnyConnect embedded browser to perform the web authentication. This option enables single sign-on (SSO) between your VPN authentication and other corporate logins. Also choose this option if you want to support web authentication methods, such as biometric authentication and Yubikeys, that cannot be performed in the embedded browser.
We updated the remote access VPN connection profile wizard to allow you to configure the SAML Login Experience.
Multiple trustpoints for SAML identity providers on Microsoft Azure.
You can now add multiple RA VPN trustpoints for SAML identity providers, as required by Microsoft Azure.
In a Microsoft Azure network, Azure can support multiple applications for the same Entity ID. Each application (typically mapped to a different tunnel group) requires a unique certificate. This feature enables you to add multiple trustpoints for RA VPN in FTDv for Microsoft Azure.
Site to Site VPN
VPN filters.
You can now configure site to site VPN filters with rules that determine whether to allow or reject tunneled data packets based on criteria such as source address, destination address, and protocol.
The VPN filter is applied to post-decrypted traffic after it exits a tunnel and to pre-encrypted traffic before it enters a tunnel.
Unique local tunnel ID for IKEv2.
You can now configure a Local Tunnel ID per IKEv2 tunnel for both policy-based and route-based Site to Site VPNs. You can configure the local tunnel ID with the FMC web interface or from the REST API.
This local tunnel ID configuration enables Umbrella SIG integration with FTD.
Multiple IKE policies.
You can now configure multiple IKE policies for both policy-based and route-based Site to Site VPNs.
Multiple IKE policies can be configured through the FMC GUI and the REST API.
VPN monitoring dashboard.
Beta.
The Site to Site VPN Monitoring Dashboard provides:
Visualization of tunnel status distribution across all devices
Visualization of network topology consisting of VPN tunnels
Ability to visually isolate and examine tunnels based on criteria like Topology, Device and Status
Note
  The Site to Site Monitoring Dashboard is a Beta feature and may not work as expected. Do not use it in production environments.
Security Intelligence
Snort 3 support for Security Intelligence on proxied traffic.
With Snort 3, you can now apply Security Intelligence to HTTP proxy traffic where the IP address is embedded into the HTTP request. For example, when a user uploads a Block list or an Allow list containing IP addresses or networks, the system matches on the destination server IP instead of proxy IP. As a result, traffic to the destination server can be blocked, monitored, or allowed (according to your Security Intelligence configuration).
Intrusion Detection and Prevention
Snort 3 support for drop, reject, rewrite, and pass rule actions.
Version 7.1 FMCs now support the following intrusion rule actions for FTD devices with Snort 3, including Version 7.0 devices:
Drop: Drops the matching packet, but does not block further traffic in this connection. Generates an intrusion event.
Reject: Drops the matching packet and blocks further traffic in this connection. For TCP traffic, sends a TCP reset. For UDP traffic, sends ICMP port unreachable to the source and destination hosts. Generates an intrusion event.
Rewrite: Overwrites the matching packet based on the replace option in the rule. Generates an intrusion event.
Pass: Allows matching packet to pass without further evaluation by any other intrusion rules. Does not generate an intrusion event.
To configure these new rule actions, edit the Snort 3 version of an intrusion policy and use the Rule Action drop-down for each rule.
Snort 3 support for TLS-based intrusion rules.
You can now create TLS-based intrusion rules to inspect decrypted TLS traffic with Snort 3. This feature allows Snort 3 intrusion rules to use TLS information.
Snort 3 support for inspection of DCE/RPC over SMB2.
Upgrade impact.
Version 7.1 with Snort 3 supports DCE/RPC inspection over SMB2.
After the first post-upgrade deploy to Snort 3 devices, existing DCE/RPC rules begin inspecting DCE/RPC over SMB2; previously these rules only inspected DCE/RPC over SMB1.
Snort 3 support for intrusion rule recommendations.
Version 7.1 FMCs now support intrusion rule recommendations for FTD devices with Snort 3, including Version 7.0 devices.
To configure this feature, edit the Snort 3 version of an intrusion policy and click the Recommendations button (in the left pane, next to All Rules).
Snort 3 support for ssl_version and ssl_state keywords.
Upgrade impact.
Version 7.1 with Snort 3 supports the ssl_version and ssl_state intrusion rule keywords.
Cisco-provided intrusion policies include active rules using those keywords. You can also create, upload, and deploy custom/third party rules using them. In Version 7.0.x, we supported those keywords with Snort 2 only. With Snort 3, rules with those keywords did not match traffic, and thus could not generate alerts or affect traffic. There was no indication that the rules were not working as expected. After the first post-upgrade deploy to Version 7.1+ Snort 3 devices, existing rules with those keywords can match traffic.
Identity Services and User Control
Snort 3 captive portal support for interception of HTTP/2 traffic.
You can now intercept and redirect HTTP/2 traffic for user authentication with captive portal.
When a redirect is received by the browser, the browser follows the redirect and authenticates with idhttpsd (Apache web server) using the same process as the HTTP/1 captive portal. After authentication, idhttpsd redirects the user back to the original URL.
Snort 3 captive portal support for hostname-based redirect.
You can configure active authentication for identity policy rules to redirect the user’s authentication to a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) rather than the IP address of the interface through which the user’s connection enters the device.
The FQDN must resolve to the IP address of one of the interfaces on the device. By using an FQDN, you can assign a certificate for active authentication that the client will recognize, thus avoiding the untrusted certificate warning users get when being redirected to an IP address. The certificate can specify the FQDN, a wildcard FQDN, or multiple FQDNs in the Subject Alternate Names (SAN) in the certificate.
New/modified screens: We added the Redirect to Host Name option in the identity policy settings.
Encrypted Traffic Handling (TLS/SSL)
Advanced TLS/SSL policy options.
You can now configure the following advanced TLS/SSL policy options in the Advanced Settings tab on the SSL Policy page:
Block flows requesting ESNI (Encrypted Server Name Identification)
Disable HTTP/3 advertisement
Propagate untrusted server certificates to clients
Encrypted Visibility Engine for visibility into encrypted sessions.
Beta.
You can enable the Encrypted Visibility Engine to gain visibility into an encrypted session without needing to decrypt it. The engine fingerprints and analyzes encrypted traffic. In FMC 7.1, the Encrypted Visibility Engine provides more visibility into encrypted traffic, including protocols such as TLS and QUIC. It does not enforce any actions on that traffic.
The Encrypted Visibility Engine is disabled by default. You can enable it on the Advanced tab of an access control policy in the Experimental Features section.
New/modified screens: Policies > Access Control > Access Control Policy name > Advanced
Note
  The Encrypted Visibility Engine is an experimental Beta feature provided for visibility. It may cause false positives.
Service Policy
Configure the maximum segment size (MSS) for embryonic connections.
You can configure a service policy to set the server maximum segment size (MSS) for SYN-cookie generation for embryonic connections upon reaching the embryonic connections limit. This is meaningful for service policies where you are also setting embryonic connection maximums.
New/modified screens: Connection Settings in the Add/Edit Service Policy wizard.
Network Discovery
Improved Snort 3 support for network discovery (remote network access support).
With improvements to network discovery and remote network access support, Snort 3 is now at parity with Snort 2 for those features. The improvements include:
Discovery of hosts and applications for SMB traffic: For SMB traffic on your network, the host is discovered in the network map, and the SMB application protocol and associated operating system information are discovered.
Discovery of NetBIOS traffic: For NetBIOS traffic, the NetBIOS name is discovered as well as associated information related to applications, such as the client application and operating system.
Discovery of applications only for hosts/networks monitored by the network discovery policy: This enhancement to the filtering logic enables you to discover applications for networks that are being monitored based on a network discovery rule.
In Snort 3, application detection is always enabled for all networks by default.
Event Logging and Analysis
Snort 3 support for elephant flow identification and monitoring.
With FTD running Snort 3, you can now identify elephant flows—single-session network connections that are large enough to affect overall system performance. By default, elephant flow detection is automatically enabled, and tracks and logs connections larger than 1GB/10 seconds.
A new predefined search for connection events (Reason = Elephant Flow) allows you to quickly identify elephant flows. You can also use the health monitor to view active elephant flows on your devices, and to create a custom health dashboard to correlate elephant flow incidence with other device metrics such as CPU usage.
To disable this feature or to configure the size and time thresholds, use the FTD CLI.
New/modified FTD CLI commands:
show elephant-flow status
show elephant-flow detection-config
system support elephant-flow-detection enable
system support elephant-flow-detection disable
system support elephant-flow-detection bytes-threshold bytes-in-MB
system support elephant-flow-detection time-threshold time-in-seconds
Send intrusion events and retrospective malware events to the Secure Network Analytics cloud from the FMC.
Upgrade impact.
When you configure the system to send security events to the Stealthwatch cloud using Cisco Security Analytics and Logging (SaaS), the FMC now sends:
Intrusion events. This allows remotely stored intrusion events to include impact flag data. Previously, these events were sent to the cloud by FTD and did not include the impact flag.
Retrospective malware events. These supplement the "original disposition" file and malware events that are still sent to the cloud by devices.
If you already enabled this feature, the FMC starts sending this information after a successful upgrade.
New datastore for intrusion events improves performance.
To improve performance, Version 7.1 uses a new datastore for intrusion events. After the upgrade finishes and the FMC reboots, historical events are migrated in the background, newest events first.
As part of this migration, we deprecated intrusion incidents, the intrusion event clipboard, and custom tables for intrusion events. We also introduced two new fields in the intrusion event table: Source Host Criticality and Destination Host Criticality.
NAT IP address and port information in connection and Security Intelligence events.
For additional visibility into NAT translations, we added the following fields to connection and Security Intelligence events:
NAT Source IP
NAT Destination IP
NAT Source Port
NAT Destination Port
In the table view of events, these fields are hidden by default. To change the fields that appear, click the x in any column name to display a field chooser.
Packet tracer enhancements.
Version 7.1 updates the packet tracer interface for better usability. In addition, you can now:
Access the packet tracer directly from the main menu: Devices > Troubleshoot > Packet Tracer.
Save packet traces.
Run parallel packet traces across multiple devices.
Replay PCAPs through a device.
For Snort 3 devices, view enhanced output that provides new details on the phases of traffic evaluation from L2 to L7 (application identification, file/malware detection, intrusion detection, Security Intelligence, and so on), as well as how long each phase takes.
New/modified FTD CLI commands:
packet-tracer inputsource_interfacepcappcap_filename
Object Management
Network object support for HTTP, ICMP, and SSH platform settings.
You can now use network object groups that contain network objects for hosts or networks when configuring the IP addresses in the Threat Defense Platform Settings policy.
Snort 3 support for network wildcard mask objects.
You can now create and manage network wildcard mask objects on the Object Management page. You can use network wildcard mask objects in access control, prefilter, and NAT policies.
Deployment preview enhancements for objects.
You can now preview deployment changes to Geolocation, File List, and Security Intelligence objects.
Updated screen: Deploy > Deployment. In the Preview column, click the Preview icon for a device to see the changes to the file list objects.
Integrations
Support for Cisco ACI Endpoint Update App, Version 2.0 and remediation module.
Version 2.0 of the Cisco ACI Endpoint Update App has the following improvements over previous versions:
The minimum update interval (how often the app updates the FMC) is now 10 seconds. Previously, it was 30 seconds.
The site prefix (a string that creates a network group object on the FMC associated with each APIC tenant) is now limited to 10 characters. Previously, it was 5 characters.
A new Cisco ACI Endpoint remediation module is also available with this update.
Usability, Performance, and Troubleshooting
Health monitoring enhancements.
We updated the health monitor as follows:
The health policy editor now groups similar health modules. You can enable and disable entire module groups.
The health policy exclusion editor is updated for better usability. Also, when you exclude a device or health module from alerting, you can now specify a time period for the exclusion, from 15 minutes to permanently.
The health monitor alert editor is updated for better usability.
The health policy deployment interface is updated for better usability.
Note
  To use the updated health monitor, you must enable REST API access on System () > Configuration > REST API Preferences.
New/modified screens:
System () > Health > Policy > Edit Policy
System () > Health > Exclude
System () > Health > Monitor Alerts
System () > Health > Policy > Deploy Policy
Deployment history enhancements.
You can now bookmark a deployment job, edit the deployment notes for a job, and generate a report.
Global search enhancements.
Global search now has the following capabilities:
You can search the full text of FMC walkthroughs (how-tos).
You can search extended community list names or configured values.
You can restrict searches by domain.
New walkthroughs.
We added the following walkthroughs:
Create a Snort 3 intrusion policy.
Enable or disable Snort 3 on an individual device.
Create a Snort 3 network analysis policy.
View the network analysis policy mapping.
Upgrade FTD.
Create and manage a cluster.
Change the FMC access interface from Management to Data.
Change the FMC access interface from Data to Management.
Snort memory usage telemetry sent to Cisco Success Network.
For improved serviceability, we now send telemetry on Snort memory and swap usage, including out-of-memory events, to Cisco Success Network.
We send this information for both Snort 2 and Snort 3. You can change your Cisco Success Network enrollment at any time.
Snort 3 support for statistics on start-of-flow and end-of-flow events.
For FTD with Snort 3, the output of the show snort statistics command now reports statistics on start-of-flow and end-of-flow events.
Web interface changes: SecureX, threat intelligence, and other integrations.
Version 7.1 changes these FMC menu options if you are upgrading from Version 7.0.2 or any later Version 7.0.x maintenance release.
Note
  These changes will switch back in Version 7.2.

FMC REST API
FMC REST API services/operations.
For information on changes to the FMC REST API, see What's New in 7.1 in the REST API quick start guide.
Deprecated Features
Table 11. Deprecated Features in FMC Version 7.1.0
Deprecated Feature
Description
End of support: FMC 1000, 2500, 4500
You cannot run Version 7.1+ on the FMC models FMC 1000, 2500, and 4500. You cannot manage Version 7.1+ devices with these FMCs.
End of support: ASA 5508-X and 5516-X
You cannot run Version 7.1+ on the ASA 5508-X or 5516-X.
End of support: NGIPS software (ASA FirePOWER/NGIPSv).
Version 7.1 is supported on the FMC and on FTD devices only. It is not supported on ASA FirePOWER or NGIPSv devices.
You can still use a Version 7.1 FMC to manage older devices — FTD as well as ASA FirePOWER and NGIPSv — that are running Version 6.5 through 7.0.
Deprecated: Intrusion incidents and the intrusion event clipboard.
Data and configurations can be deleted.
We removed the intrusion incidents feature and the related intrusion event clipboard. The upgrade removes all data related to incidents, and deletes report templates sections that use the clipboard as a data source.
Deprecated screens/options:
Analysis > Intrusions > Incidents
Analysis > Intrusions > Clipboard
Copy and Copy All on intrusion event workflow pages and packet views
When adding sections to a report template (Overview > Reporting > Report Templates), you can no longer choose the Clipboard table as a data source.
Deprecated: Custom tables for intrusion events.
Custom tables can be deleted.
Version 7.1 ends support for custom tables for intrusion events. The upgrade deletes custom tables that contain fields from the intrusion event table.
When adding fields to a custom table (Analysis > Advanced > Custom Tables), you can no longer choose the Intrusion Events table as a data source.
Deprecated: ECMP zones with FlexConfig.
FlexConfig settings ignored. Can prevent deploy.
You can now group interfaces in traffic zones and configure Equal-Cost-Multi-Path (ECMP) routing in the management center web interface. After upgrade, the system ignores ECMP zones configured with FlexConfig. You cannot deploy with equal-cost static routes exist and must assign their interfaces to an ECMP zone.
Temporarily deprecated: Improved SecureX integration, SecureX orchestration.
Can prevent upgrade.
Version 7.1 temporarily deprecates the SecureX integration and orchestration improvements introduced in Version 7.0.2. The improved experience returns in Version 7.2.
If you newly enabled SecureX integration in Version 7.0.2 or later maintenance release, you must disable the feature before you upgrade to Version 7.1. You can re-enable the feature after successful upgrade, using the older method. There are no upgrade issues if you enabled SecureX integration in Version 7.0.0 or 7.0.1, or if you upgrade to Version 7.2.
Deprecated: Geolocation details.
In May 2022 we split the GeoDB into two packages: a country code package that maps IP addresses to countries/continents, and an IP package that contains additional contextual data associated with routable IP addresses. The contextual data in the IP package can include additional location details, as well as connection information such as ISP, connection type, proxy type, domain name, and so on.
The new country code package has the same file name as the old all-in-one package: Cisco_GEODB_Update-date-build. This allows deployments running Version 7.1 and earlier to continue to obtain GeoDB updates. If you manually download GeoDB updates—for example, in an air-gapped deployment—make sure you get the country code package and not the IP package.
Important
  This split does not affect geolocation rules or traffic handling in any way—those rules rely only on the data in the country code package. However, because the country code package essentially replaces the all-in-one package, the contextual data is no longer updated and will grow stale. To obtain fresh data, upgrade or reimage the FMC to Version 7.2+ and update the GeoDB.
New Features in FMC Version 7.0
New Features
Table 12. New Features in FMC Version 7.0.5
New Feature
Description
ISA 3000 System LED support for shutting down.
When you shut down the ISA 3000, the System LED turns off. Wait at least 10 seconds after that before you remove power from the device.
Note
  Version 7.1 temporarily deprecates support for this feature. Support returns in Version 7.3.
Automatically update CA bundles.
Upgrade impact. The system connects to Cisco for something new.
The local CA bundle contains certificates to access several Cisco services. The system now automatically queries Cisco for new CA certificates at a daily system-defined time. Previously, you had to upgrade the software to update CA certificates. You can use the CLI to disable this feature.
Note
  This feature is not supported in Version 7.0.0–7.0.4, 7.1.0–7.1.0.2, or 7.2.0–7.2.3. If you upgrade from a supported version to an unsupported version, the feature is temporarily disabled and the system stops contacting Cisco.
New/modified CLI commands: configure cert-update auto-update , configure cert-update run-now , configure cert-update test , show cert-update
For more information, see the Firepower Management Center Command Line Reference in the FMC configuration guide, and the Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Command Reference.
Table 13. New Features in FMC Version 7.0.3
New Feature
Description
FTD support for cloud-delivered management center.
Version 7.0.3 FTD devices support management by the cloud-delivered management center, which we introduced in spring of 2022. The cloud-delivered management center uses the Cisco Defense Orchestrator (CDO) platform and unites management across multiple Cisco security solutions. We take care of feature updates.
You should use Version 7.0.3 FTD with the cloud-delivered management center if:
You are currently using a customer-deployed hardware or virtual FMC.
You want to migrate to the cloud-delivered management center right now.
You do not want to upgrade devices to Version 7.2+, which also supports management by the cloud-delivered management center.
If this is your situation, you should:
Upgrade the current FMC to Version 7.2+.
Although you can technically use a Version 7.0.3 or 7.1 FMC to upgrade FTD to Version 7.0.3, you will not be able to easily migrate devices to the cloud-delivered management center, nor will you be able to leave the devices registered to the customer-deployed management center for event logging and analytics purposes only ("analytics only").
Use the upgraded FMC to upgrade devices to Version 7.0.3.
Enable cloud management on the devices.
For Version 7.0.x devices only, you must enable cloud management from the device CLI: configure manager-cdo enable . The show manager-cdo command displays whether cloud management is enabled.
Use CDO's Migrate FTD to Cloud wizard to migrate the devices to the cloud-delivered management center.
Optionally, leave the devices registered to the customer-deployed management center as analytics-only devices. Or, you can send security events to the Cisco cloud with Security Analytics and Logging (SaaS).
The cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center cannot manage threat defense devices running Version 7.1, or Classic devices running any version. You cannot upgrade a cloud-managed device from Version 7.0.x to Version 7.1 unless you unregister and disable cloud management. We recommend you upgrade the device directly to Version 7.2+.
New/modified CLI commands: configure manager add , configure manager delete , configure manager edit , show managers
For more information, see Managing Firewall Threat Defense with Cloud-Delivered Firewall Management Center in Cisco Defense Orchestrator.
Table 14. New Features in FMC Version 7.0.2
New Feature
Description
ISA 3000 support for shutting down.
You can now shut down the ISA 3000; previously, you could only reboot the device.
Note
  Version 7.1 temporarily deprecates support for this feature. Support returns in Version 7.2.
Dynamic object names now support the dash character.
Dynamic object names now support the dash character. This is especially useful if you are using the ACI endpoint update app (where the dash character is allowed), to create dynamic objects on the FMC that represent tenant endpoint groups.
Minimum threat defense: 7.0.2
Improved SecureX integration, SecureX orchestration.
We have streamlined the SecureX integration process. Now, as long as you already have a SecureX account, you just choose your cloud region on the new Integration > SecureX page, click Enable SecureX, and authenticate to SecureX. The option to send events to the cloud, as well as to enable Cisco Success Network and Cisco Support Diagnostics, are also moved to this new page.
When you enable SecureX integration on this new page, licensing and management for the system's cloud connection switches from Cisco Smart Licensing to SecureX. If you already enabled SecureX the "old" way, you must disable and re-enable to get the benefits of this cloud connection management.
Note that this page also governs the cloud region for and event types sent to the Secure Network Analytics (Stealthwatch) cloud using Security Analytics and Logging (SaaS), even though the web interface does not indicate this. Previously, these options were on System () > Integration > Cloud Services. Enabling SecureX does not affect communications with the Secure Network Analytics cloud; you can send events to both.
The management center also now supports SecureX orchestration—a powerful drag-and-drop interface you can use to automate workflows across security tools. After you enable SecureX, you can enable orchestration.
As part of this feature, you can no longer use the REST API to configure SecureX integration. You must use the FMC web interface.
Note
  This feature is temporarily deprecated in Version 7.1, but returns in Version 7.2. Note that if you use the new method to enable SecureX integration, you must disable the feature before you upgrade to Version 7.1. You can re-enable the feature after successful upgrade. Upgrades to Version 7.2+ are not affected.
For more information, see the Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (7.0.2 and 7.2) and SecureX Integration Guide.
Web interface changes: SecureX, threat intelligence, and other integrations.
We changed these FMC menu options.
Note
  These changes are temporarily deprecated in Version 7.1, but come back in Version 7.2.

Table 15. New Features in FMC Version 7.0.1
New Feature
Description
Snort 3 rate_filter inspector.
We introduced the Snort 3 rate_filter inspector.
This allows you to change the action of an intrusion rule in response to excessive matches on that rule. You can block rate-based attacks for a specific length of time, then return to allowing matching traffic while still generating events. For more information, see the Snort 3 Inspector Reference.
Note
  This feature requires Version 7.0.1+ on both the FMC and the device. Additionally, you must be running lsp-rel-20210816-1910 or later. You can check and update the LSP on System () > Updates > Rule Updates.
New/modified pages: Configure the inspector by editing the Snort 3 version of a custom network analysis policy.
Supported platforms: FTD
New default password for ISA 3000 with ASA FirePOWER Services
For new devices, the default password for the admin account is now Adm!n123. Previously, the default admin password was Admin123.
Upgrading or reimaging to Version 7.0.1+ does not change the password. However, we do recommend that all user accounts—especially those with Admin access—have strong passwords.
Supported platforms: ISA 3000 with ASA FirePOWER Services
Table 16. New Features in FMC Version 7.0.0
New Feature
Description
Platform
VMware vSphere/VMware ESXi 7.0 support.
You can now deploy FMCv, FTDv, and NGIPSv virtual appliances on VMware vSphere/VMware ESXi 7.0.
Note that Version 7.0 also discontinues support for VMware 6.0. Upgrade the hosting environment to a supported version before you upgrade the Firepower software.
New virtual environments.
We introduced FMCv and FTDv for:
Cisco HyperFlex
Nutanix Enterprise Cloud
OpenStack
FTDv performance tiered Smart Licensing.
Upgrade impact. Upgrading automatically assigns devices to the FTDv50 tier.
FTDv now supports performance-tiered Smart Software Licensing, based on throughput requirements and RA VPN session limits. Options run from FTDv5 (100 Mbps/50 sessions) to FTDv100 (16 Gbps/10,000 sessions).
Before you add a new device, make sure your account contains the licenses you need. To purchase additional licenses, contact your Cisco representative or partner contact.
Upgrading FTDv to Version 7.0 automatically assigns the device to the FTDv50 tier. To continue using your legacy (non-tiered) license, after upgrade, change the tier to Variable.
For more information on supported instances, throughputs, and other hosting requirements, see the appropriate Getting Started Guide.
New/modified pages:
You can now specify a performance tier when adding or editing an FTDv device on the Device > Device Management page.
You can bulk-edit performance tiers on System () > Licenses > Smart Licenses > page.
High Availability/Scalability
Improved PAT port block allocation for clustering
The improved PAT port block allocation ensures that the control unit keeps ports in reserve for joining nodes, and proactively reclaims unused ports. To best optimize the allocation, you can set the maximum nodes you plan to have in the cluster using the cluster-member-limit command using FlexConfig. The control unit can then allocate port blocks to the planned number of nodes, and it will not have to reserve ports for extra nodes you don't plan to use. The default is 16 nodes. You can also monitor syslog 747046 to ensure that there are enough ports available for a new node.
New/modified commands: cluster-member-limit (FlexConfig), show nat pool cluster [summary] , show nat pool ip detail
Supported platforms: Firepower 4100/9300
FTD CLI show cluster history improvements.
New keywords allow you to customize the output of the show cluster history command.
New/modified commands: show cluster history [brief ] [latest ] [reverse ] [time ]
Supported platforms: Firepower 4100/9300
FTD CLI command to permanently leave a cluster.
You can now use the FTD CLI to permanently remove a unit from the cluster, converting its configuration to a standalone device.
New/modified commands: cluster reset-interface-mode
Supported platforms: Firepower 4100/9300
NAT
Prioritized system-defined NAT rules.
We added a new Section 0 to the NAT rule table. This section is exclusively for the use of the system. Any NAT rules that the system needs for normal functioning are added to this section, and these rules take priority over any rules you create. Previously, system-defined rules were added to Section 1, and user-defined rules could interfere with proper system functioning.
You cannot add, edit, or delete Section 0 rules, but you will see them in show nat detail command output.
Supported platforms: FTD
Virtual Routing
Virtual router support for the ISA 3000.
You can now configure up to 10 virtual routers on an ISA 3000 device.
Supported platforms: ISA 3000
Site to Site VPN
Backup virtual tunnel interfaces (VTI) for route-based site-to-site VPN.
When you configure a site-to-site VPN that uses virtual tunnel interfaces, you can select a backup VTI for the tunnel.
Specifying a backup VTI provides resiliency, so that if the primary connection goes down, the backup connection might still be functional. For example, you could point the primary VTI to the endpoint of one service provider, and the backup VTI to the endpoint of a different service provider.
New/modified pages: We added the ability to add a backup VTI to the site-to-site VPN wizard when you select Route-Based as the VPN type for a point-to-point connection.
Supported platforms: FTD
Remote Access VPN
Load balancing.
We now support RA VPN load balancing. The system distributes sessions among grouped devices by number of sessions; it does not consider traffic volume or other factors.
New/modified screens: We added load balancing options to the Advanced settings in an RA VPN policy.
Supported platforms: FTD
Local authentication.
We now support local authentication for RA VPN users. You can use this as the primary or secondary authentication method, or as a fallback in case the configured remote server cannot be reached.
Create a local realm.
Local usernames and passwords are stored in local realms. When you create a realm (System () > Integration > Realms) and select the new LOCAL realm type, the system prompts you to add one or more local users.
Configure RA VPN to use local authentication.
Create or edit an RA VPN policy (Devices > VPN > Remote Access), create a connection profile within that policy, then specify LOCAL as the primary, secondary, or fallback authentication server in that connection profile.
Associate the local realm you created with an RA VPN policy.
In the RA VPN policy editor, use the new Local Realm setting. Every connection profile in the RA VPN policy that uses local authentication will use the local realm you specify here.
Supported platforms: FTD
Dynamic access policies.
The new dynamic access policy allows you to configure remote access VPN authorization that automatically adapts to a changing environment:
Configure HostScan by uploading the AnyConnect HostScan package as an AnyConnect file (Objects > Object Management > VPN > AnyConnect File). There is a new HostScan Package option in the File Type drop-down list.
This module runs on endpoints and performs a posture assessment that the dynamic access policy will use.
Create a dynamic access policy (Devices > Dynamic Access Policy).
Dynamic access policies specify session attributes (such as group membership and endpoint security) that you want to evaluate each time a user initiates a session. You can then deny or grant access based on that evaluation.
Associate the dynamic access policy you created with an RA VPN policy.
In the remote access VPN policy editor, use the new Dynamic Access Policy setting.
Supported platforms: FTD
Multi-certificate authentication.
We now support multi-certificate authentication for remote access VPN users. You can validate the machine or device certificate, to ensure the device is a corporate-issued device, in addition to authenticating the user’s identity certificate to allow VPN access using the AnyConnect client during SSL or IKEv2 EAP phase.
Supported platforms: FTD
AnyConnect custom attributes.
We now support AnyConnect custom attributes, and provide an infrastructure to configure AnyConnect client features without adding explicit support for these features in the system.
Supported platforms: FTD
Access Control
Snort 3 for FTD.
For new FTD deployments, Snort 3 is now the default inspection engine. Upgraded deployments continue to use Snort 2, but you can switch at any time.
Advantages to using Snort 3 include, but are not limited to:
Improved performance.
Improved SMBv2 inspection.
New script detection capabilities.
HTTP/2 inspection.
Custom rule groups.
Syntax that makes custom intrusion rules easier to write.
Reasons for 'would have dropped' inline results in intrusion events.
No Snort restarts when deploying changes to the VDB, SSL policies, custom application detectors, captive portal identity sources, and TLS server identity discovery.
Improved serviceability, due to Snort 3-specific telemetry data sent to Cisco Success Network, and to better troubleshooting logs.
A Snort 3 intrusion rule update is called an LSP (Lightweight Security Package) rather than an SRU. The system still uses SRUs for Snort 2; downloads from Cisco contain both the latest LSP and SRU. The system automatically uses the appropriate rule set for your configurations.
The FMC can manage a deployment with both Snort 2 and Snort 3 devices, and will apply the correct policies to each device. However, unlike Snort 2, you cannot update Snort 3 on a device by upgrading the FMC only and then deploying. With Snort 3, new features and resolved bugs require you upgrade the software on the FMC and its managed devices. For information on the Snort included with each software version, see the Bundled Components section of the Cisco Firepower Compatibility Guide.
Important
  Before you switch to Snort 3, we strongly recommend you read and understand the Firepower Management Center Snort 3 Configuration Guide. Pay special attention to feature limitations and migration instructions. Although upgrading to Snort 3 is designed for minimal impact, features do not map exactly. Careful planning and preparation can help you make sure that traffic handled as expected.
You can also visit the Snort 3 website: https://snort.org/snort3.
Supported platforms: FTD
Dynamic objects.
You can now use dynamic objects in access control rules.
A dynamic object is just a list of IP addresses/subnets (no ranges, no FQDN). But unlike a network object, changes to dynamic objects take effect immediately, without having to redeploy. This is useful in virtual and cloud environments, where IP addresses often dynamically map to workload resources.
To create and manage dynamic objects, we recommend the Cisco Secure Dynamic Attributes Connector. The connector is a separate, lightweight application that quickly and seamlessly updates firewall policies based on workload changes. To do this, it gets workload attributes from tagged resources in your environment, and compiles an IP list based on criteria you specify (a “dynamic attributes filter”). It then creates a dynamic object on the FMC and populates it with the IP list. When your workload changes, the connector updates the dynamic object and the system immediately starts handling traffic based on the new mappings. For more information, see the Cisco Secure Dynamic Attributes Connector Configuration Guide.
After you create a dynamic object, you can add it to access control rules on the new Dynamic Attributes tab in the access control rule editor. This tab replaces the narrower-focus SGT/ISE Attributes tab; continue to configure rules with SGT attributes here.
Note
  You can also create a dynamic object on the FMC: Objects > Object Management > External Attributes > Dynamic Objects. However, this creates the container only; you must then populate and manage it using the REST API. See the Firepower Management Center REST API Quick Start Guide, Version 7.0.
Supported platforms: FMC
Supported virtual/cloud workloads for Cisco Secure Dynamic Attributes Connector integration: Microsoft Azure, AWS, VMware
Cross-domain trust for Active Directory domains.
You can now configure user identity rules with users from Microsoft Active Directory forests (groupings of AD domains that trust each other).
New/modified pages:
You now configure a realm and directories at the same time.
A new Sync Results page (System () > Integration > Sync Results) displays any errors related to downloading users and groups in a cross-domain trust relationship.
Supported platforms: FMC
DNS filtering.
DNS filtering, which was introduced as a Beta feature in Version 6.7, is now fully supported and is enabled by default in new access control policies.
Supported platforms: Any
Event Logging and Analysis
Improved process for storing events in a Secure Network Analytics on-prem deployment.
A new Cisco Security Analytics and Logging (On Premises) app and a new FMC wizard make it easier to configure remote data storage for on-prem Secure Network Analytics solutions:
Deploy hardware or virtual Stealthwatch appliances.
You can use a Stealthwatch Management Console alone, or you can configure Stealthwatch Management Console, flow collector, and data store.
Install the new Cisco Security Analytics and Logging (On Premises) app on your Stealthwatch Management Console to configure Stealthwatch as a remote data store.
On the FMC, use one of the new wizards on System () > Logging > Security Analytics & Logging to connect to your Stealthwatch deployment.
Note that the wizards replace the narrower-focus page where you used to configure Stealthwatch contextual cross-launch; that is now a step in the wizard.
For upgraded deployments where you were using syslog to send Firepower events to Stealthwatch, disable those configurations before you use the wizard. Otherwise, you will get double events. To remove the syslog connection to Stealthwatch use FTD platform settings (Devices > Platform Settings); to disable sending events to syslog, edit your access control rules.
For more information, including Stealthwatch hardware and software requirements, see Cisco Security Analytics and Logging (On Premises): Firewall Event Integration Guide.
Supported platforms: FMC
Work with events stored remotely in a Secure Network Analytics on-prem deployment.
You can now use the FMC to work with connection events stored remotely in a Secure Network Analytics on-prem deployment.
A new Data Source option on the connection events page (Analysis > Connections > Events) and in the unified event viewer (Analysis > Unified Events) allows you to choose which connection events you want to work with. The default is to display locally stored connection events, unless there are none in the time range. In that case, the system displays remotely stored events..
We also added a data source option to report templates (Overview > Reporting > Report Templates), so that you can generate reports based on remotely stored connection events.
Note
  This feature is supported for connection events only; cross-launch is still the only way to examine remotely stored Security Intelligence, intrusion, file and malware events. Even in the unified event viewer, the system only displays locally stored events of those types.
However, note that for every Security Intelligence event, there is an identical connection event—these are the events with reasons such as 'IP Block' or 'DNS Block.' You can work with those duplicated events on the connection events page or in the unified event viewer, but not on the dedicated Security Intelligence events page.
Supported platforms: FMC.
Store all connection events in the Secure Network Analytics cloud.
You can now store all connection events in the Stealthwatch cloud using Cisco Security Analytics and Logging (SaaS). Previously, you were limited to security events: Security Intelligence, intrusion, file, and malware events, as well as their associated connection events.
To change the events you send to the cloud, choose System () > Integration. On the Cloud Services tab, edit the Cisco Cloud Event Configuration. The old option to send high priority connection events to the cloud has been replaced with a choice of All, None, or Security Events.
Note
  These settings also control which events you send to SecureX. However, even if you choose to send all connection events to the cloud, SecureX consumes only the security (higher priority) connection events. Also note that you now configure the SecureX connection itself on Analysis > SecureX.
Supported platforms: FMC
Unified event viewer.
The unified event viewer (Analysis > Unified Events) displays connection, Security Intelligence, intrusion, file, and malware events in a single table. This can help you look relationships between events of different types.
A single search field allows you to dynamically filter the view based on multiple criteria, and a Go Live option displays events received from managed devices in real time.
Supported platforms: FMC
SecureX ribbon.
The SecureX ribbon on the FMC pivots into SecureX for instant visibility into the threat landscape across your Cisco security products.
To connect with SecureX and enable the ribbon, use System > SecureX. Note that you must still use System () > Integration > Cloud Services to choose your cloud region and to specify which events to send to SecureX.
For more information, see the Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense and SecureX Integration Guide.
Supported platforms: FMC
Exempt all connection events from rate limiting when you turn off local storage.
Event rate limiting applies to all events sent to the FMC, with the exception of security events: Security Intelligence, intrusion, file, and malware events, as well as their associated connection events.
Now, disabling local connection event storage exempts all connection events from rate limiting, not just security events. To do this, set the Maximum Connection Events to zero on System () > Configuration > Database.
Note
  Other than turning it off by setting it to zero, Maximum Connection Events does not govern connection event rate limiting. Any non-zero number in this field ensures that all lower-priority connection events are rate limited.
Note that disabling local event storage does not affect remote event storage, nor does it affect connection summaries or correlation. The system still uses connection event information for features like traffic profiles, correlation policies, and dashboard displays.
Supported platforms: FMC
Port and protocol displayed together in file and malware event tables.
In file and malware event tables, the port field now displays the protocol, and you can search port fields for protocol. For events that existed before upgrade, if the protocol is not known, the system uses "tcp."
New/modified pages:
Analysis > Files > Malware Events
Analysis > Files > File Events
Supported platforms: FMC
Upgrade
Improved FTD upgrade performance and status reporting.
FTD upgrades are now easier faster, more reliable, and take up less disk space. A new Upgrades tab in the Message Center provides further enhancements to upgrade status and error reporting.
Supported platforms: FTD
Upgrade wizard for FTD.
A new device upgrade page (Devices > Device Upgrade) on the FMC provides an easy-to-follow wizard for upgrading Version 6.4+ FTD devices. It walks you through important pre-upgrade stages, including selecting devices to upgrade, copying the upgrade package to the devices, and compatibility and readiness checks.
To begin, use the new Upgrade Firepower Software action on the Device Management page (Devices > Device Management > Select Action).
As you proceed, the system displays basic information about your selected devices, as well as the current upgrade-related status. This includes any reasons why you cannot upgrade. If a device does not "pass" a stage in the wizard, it does not appear in the next stage.
If you navigate away from wizard, your progress is preserved, although other users with Administrator access can reset, modify, or continue the wizard.
Note
  You must still use System () > Updates to upload or specify the location of FTD upgrade packages. You must also use the System Updates page to upgrade the FMC itself, as well as all non-FTD managed devices.
Note
  In Version 7.0, the wizard does not correctly display devices in clusters or high availability pairs. Even though you must select and upgrade these devices as a unit, the wizard displays them as standalone devices. Device status and upgrade readiness are evaluated and reported on an individual basis. This means it is possible for one unit to appear to "pass" to the next stage while the other unit or units do not. However, these devices are still grouped. Running a readiness check on one, runs it on all. Starting the upgrade on one, starts it on all.
To avoid possible time-consuming upgrade failures, manually ensure all group members are ready to move on to the next step of the wizard before you click Next.
Supported platforms: FTD
Upgrade more FTD devices at once.
The FTD upgrade wizard lifts the following restrictions:
Simultaneous device upgrades.
The number of devices you can upgrade at once is now limited by your management network bandwidth—not the system's ability to manage simultaneous upgrades. Previously, we recommended against upgrading more than five devices at a time.
Important
  Only upgrades to FTD Version 6.7+ see this improvement. If you are upgrading devices to an older FTD release—even if you are using the new upgrade wizard—we still recommend you limit to five devices at a time.
Grouping upgrades by device model.
You can now queue and invoke upgrades for all FTD models at the same time, as long as the system has access to the appropriate upgrade packages.
Previously, you would choose an upgrade package, then choose the devices to upgrade using that package. That meant that you could upgrade multiple devices at the same time only if they shared an upgrade package. For example, you could upgrade two Firepower 2100 series devices at the same time, but not a Firepower 2100 series and a Firepower 1000 series.
Supported platforms: FTD
Administration and Troubleshooting
Zero-touch restore for the ISA 3000 using the SD card.
When you perform a local backup, the backup file is copied to the SD card if present. To restore the configuration on a replacement device, simply install the SD card in the new device, and depress the Reset button for 3 to 15 seconds during the device bootup.
Supported platforms: ISA 3000
Selectively deploy RA and site-to-site VPN policies.
Selective policy deployment, which was introduced in Version 6.6, now supports remote access and site-to-site VPN policies.
New/modified pages: We added VPN policy options on the Deploy > Deployment page.
Supported platforms: FTD

Additionally, full support returns for the Configuration Memory Allocation module, which was introduced in Version 6.6.3 as the Appliance Configuration Resource Utilization module, but was not fully supported in Version 6.7.
Supported platforms: FMC
Security and Hardening
New default password for AWS deployments.
The default password for the admin account is now the AWS Instance ID, unless you define a default password with user data (Advanced Details > User Data) during the initial deployment.
Previously, the default admin password was Admin123.
Supported platforms: FMCv for AWS, FTDv for AWS
EST for certificate enrollment.
Support for Enrollment over Secure Transport for certificate enrollment was provided.
New/modified pages: New enrollment options when configuring Objects > PKI > Cert Enrollment > CA Information tab.
Supported platforms: FMC
Support for EdDSA certificate type.
A new certificate key type- EdDSA was added with key size 256.
New/modified pages: New certificate key options when configuring Objects > PKI > Cert Enrollment > Key tab.
Supported platforms: FMC
AES-128 CMAC authentication for NTP servers.
You can now use AES-128 CMAC keys to secure connections between the FMC and NTP servers.
New/modified pages: System () > Configuration > Time Synchronization.
Supported platforms: FMC
SNMPv3 users can authenticate using a SHA-224 or SHA-384 authorization algorithm.
SNMPv3 users can now authenticate using a SHA-224 or SHA-384 algorithm.
New/modified pages: Devices > Platform Settings > SNMP > Users > Auth Algorithm Type
Supported platforms: FTD
Usability and Performance
Global search for policies and objects.
You can now search for certain policies by name, and for certain objects by name and configured value. This feature is not available with the Classic theme.
New/modified pages: We added capabilities to the Search icon and field on the FMC menu bar, to the left of the Deploy menu.
Supported platforms: FMC
Hardware crypto acceleration on FTDv using Intel QuickAssist Technology (QAT).
We now support hardware crypto acceleration (CBC cipher only) on FTDv for VMware and FTDv for KVM. This feature requires a Intel QAT 8970 PCI adapter/Version 1.7+ driver on the hosting platform. After you reboot, hardware crypto acceleration is automatically enabled.
Supported platforms: FTDv for VMware, FTDv for KVM
Improved CPU usage and performance for many-to-one and one-to-many connections.
The system no longer creates local host objects and locks them when creating connections, except for connections that involve dynamic NAT/PAT and scanning threat detection and host statistics. This improves performance and CPU usage in situations where many connections are going to the same server (such as a load balancer or web server), or one endpoint is making connections to many remote hosts.
We changed the following commands: clear local-host (deprecated), show local-host
Supported platforms: FTD
How-to location has changed.
Help > How-Tos now invokes walkthroughs. Previously, you clicked How-Tos at the bottom of the browser window.

Deprecated Features
Table 17. Deprecated Features in FMC Version 7.0.0
Deprecated Feature
Description
End of support: VMware vSphere/VMware ESXi 6.0.
We discontinued support for virtual deployments on VMware vSphere/VMware ESXi 6.0. Upgrade the hosting environment to a supported version before you upgrade the Firepower software.
Deprecated: RSA certificates with keys smaller than 2048 bits, or that use SHA-1 in their signature algorithm.
Prevents post-upgrade VPN connections through FTD devices.
We removed support for RSA certificates with keys smaller than 2048 bits, or that use SHA-1 in their signature algorithm.
Before you upgrade, use the object manager to update your PKI certificate enrollments with stronger options: Objects > PKI > Cert Enrollment. Otherwise, although the upgrade preserves your current settings, VPN connections through the device will fail.
To continue managing older FTD devices only (Version 6.4–6.7.x) with these weaker options, select the new Enable Weak-Crypto option for each device on the Devices > Certificates page.
Deprecated: MD5 authentication algorithm and DES encryption for SNMPv3 users.
Deletes Users. Prevents post-upgrade deploy.
We removed support for the MD5 authentication algorithm and DES encryption for SNMPv3 users on FTD devices.
Upgrading FTD to Version 7.0+ deletes these users from the device, regardless of the configurations on the FMC. If you are still using these options in your platform settings policy, change and verify your configurations before you upgrade FTD.
These options are in the Auth Algorithm Type and Encryption Type drop-downs when creating or editing an SNMPv3 user in a Threat Defense platform settings policy: Devices > Platform Settings.
Deprecated: Port 32137 comms with AMP clouds.
Prevents FMC upgrade.
We deprecated the FMC option to use port 32137 to obtain file disposition data from public and private AMP clouds. Unless you configure a proxy, the FMC now uses port 443/HTTPS.
Before you upgrade, disable the Use Legacy Port 32137 for AMP for Networks option on the System > Integration > Cloud Services page. Do not proceed with upgrade until your AMP for Networks deployment is working as expected.
Deprecated: HA Status health module.
We renamed the HA Status health module to the FMC HA Status health module. This is to distinguish it from the new FTD HA Status module.
Deprecated: Legacy API Explorer.
We removed support for the FMC REST API legacy API Explorer.
Deprecated: Geolocation details.
In May 2022 we split the GeoDB into two packages: a country code package that maps IP addresses to countries/continents, and an IP package that contains additional contextual data associated with routable IP addresses. The contextual data in the IP package can include additional location details, as well as connection information such as ISP, connection type, proxy type, domain name, and so on.
The new country code package has the same file name as the old all-in-one package: Cisco_GEODB_Update-date-build. This allows deployments running Version 7.1 and earlier to continue to obtain GeoDB updates. If you manually download GeoDB updates—for example, in an air-gapped deployment—make sure you get the country code package and not the IP package.
Important
  This split does not affect geolocation rules or traffic handling in any way—those rules rely only on the data in the country code package. However, because the country code package essentially replaces the all-in-one package, the contextual data is no longer updated and will grow stale. To obtain fresh data, upgrade or reimage the FMC to Version 7.2+ and update the GeoDB.
New Features in FMC Version 6.7
New Features
Table 18. New Features in FMC Version 6.7.0
New Feature
Description
Platform
FMCv and FTDv for OCI and GCP.
We introduced FMCv and FTDv for:
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
High availability support on FMCv for VMware.
FMCv for VMware now supports high availability. You use the FMCv web interface to establish HA, just as you would on hardware models.
In an FTD deployment, you need two identically licensed FMCv's, as well as one FTD entitlement for each managed device. For example, to manage 10 FTD devices with an FMCv10 HA pair, you need two FMCv10 entitlements and 10 FTD entitlements. If you are managing Classic devices only (7000/8000 series, NGIPSv, ASA FirePOWER), you do not need FMCv entitlements.
Note that this feature is not supported on FMCv 2 for VMware—that is, an FMCv licensed to manage only two devices.
Supported platforms: FMCv 10, 25, and 300 for VMware
Auto Scale improvements for FTDv for AWS.
Version 6.7.0 includes the following Auto Scale improvements for FTDv for AWS:
Custom Metric Publisher. A new Lambda function polls the FMC every second minute for memory consumption of all FTDv instances in the Auto Scale group, then publishes the value to CloudWatch Metric.
A new scaling policy based on memory consumption is available.
FTDv private IP connectivity for SSH and Secure Tunnel to the FMC.
FMC configuration validation.
Support for opening more Listening ports on ELB.
Modified to Single Stack deployment. All Lambda functions and AWS resources are deployed from a single stack for a streamlined deployment.
Supported platforms: FTDv for AWS
Auto Scale improvements for FTDv for Azure.
The FTDv for Azure Auto Scale solution now includes support for scaling metrics based on CPU and memory (RAM), not just CPU.
Supported platforms: FTDv for Azure
Firepower Threat Defense: Device Management
Manage FTD on a data interface.
You can now configure FMC management of the FTD on a data interface instead of using the dedicated management interface.
This feature is useful for remote deployment when you want to manage the FTD at a branch office from an FMC at headquarters and need to manage the FTD on the outside interface. If the FTD receives a public IP address using DHCP, then you can optionally configure Dynamic DNS (DDNS) for the interface using the web type update method. DDNS ensures the FMC can reach the FTD at its Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) if the FTD's IP address changes.
Note
  FMC access on a data interface is not supported with clustering or high availability.
New/modified pages:
Devices > Device Management > Device > Management section
Devices > Device Management > Interfaces > FMC Access
Devices > Device Management > DHCP > DDNS > DDNS Update Methods page
New/modified FTD CLI commands: configure network management-data-interface , configure policy rollback
Supported platforms: FTD
Update the FMC IP address on the FTD.
If you change the FMC IP address, you can now use the FTD CLI to update the device.
New/modified FTD CLI commands: configure manager edit
Supported platforms: FTD
Synchronization between the FTD operational link state and the physical link state for the Firepower 4100/9300.
The Firepower 4100/9300 chassis can now synchronize the FTD operational link state with the physical link state for data interfaces.
Currently, interfaces will be in an Up state as long as the FXOS admin state is up and the physical link state is up. The FTD application interface admin state is not considered. Without synchronization from FTD, data interfaces can be in an Up state physically before the FTD application has completely come online, for example, or can stay Up for a period of time after you initiate an FTD shutdown. For inline sets, this state mismatch can result in dropped packets because external routers may start sending traffic to the FTD before the FTD can handle it.
This feature is disabled by default, and can be enabled per logical device in FXOS.
Note
  This feature is not supported for clustering, container instances, or an FTD with a Radware vDP decorator. It is also not supported for ASA.
New/modified Firepower Chassis Manager pages: Logical Devices > Enable Link State
New/modified FXOS commands: set link-state-sync enabled , show interface expand detail
Supported platforms: Firepower 4100/9300
Firepower 1100/2100 series SFP interfaces now support disabling auto-negotiation.
Upgrade impact.
You can now configure a Firepower 1100/2100 series SFP interface to disable flow control and link status negotiation.
Previously, when you set an SFP interface speed (1000 or 10000 Mbps) on these devices, flow control and link status negotiation was automatically enabled. You could not disable it.
Now, you can select No Negotiate to disable flow control and link status negotiation. This also sets the speed to 1000 Mbps, regardless of whether you are configuring a 1 GB SFP or 10 GB SFP+ interface. You cannot disable negotation at 10000 Mbps.
New/modified pages: Devices > Device Management > Interfaces > edit interface > Hardware Configuration > Speed
Supported platforms: Firepower 1100/2100 series
Firepower Threat Defense: Clustering
New cluster management functionality on the FMC.
You can now use the FMC to perform the following cluster management tasks, where previously you had to use the CLI:
Enable and disable cluster units.
Show cluster status from the Device Management page, including History and Summary per unit.
Change the role to the control unit.
New/modified pages:
Devices > Device Management > More menu
Devices > Device Management > Cluster > General area > Cluster Live Status link > Cluster Status
Supported platforms: Firepower 4100/9300
Faster cluster deployment.
Cluster deployment now completes faster. Also, for most deployment failures, it fails more quickly.
Supported platforms: Firepower 4100/9300
Changes to PAT address allocation in clustering. The PAT pool Flat Port Range option is now enabled by default and it is not configurable.
Upgrade impact.
The way PAT addresses are distributed to the members of a cluster is changed.
Previously, addresses were distributed to the members of the cluster, so your PAT pool would need a minimum of one address per cluster member. Now, the control instead divides each PAT pool address into equal-sized port blocks and distributes them across cluster members. Each member has port blocks for the same PAT addresses. Thus, you can reduce the size of the PAT pool, even to as few as one IP address, depending on the amount of connections you typically need to PAT.
Port blocks are allocated in 512-port blocks from the 1024-65535 range. You can optionally include the reserved ports, 1-1023, in this block allocation when you configure PAT pool rules. For example, in a 4-node cluster, each node gets 32 blocks with which it will be able to handle 16384 connections per PAT pool IP address compared to a single node handling all 65535 connections per PAT pool IP address.
As part of this change, PAT pools for all systems, whether standalone or operating in a cluster, now use a flat port range of 1024–65535. Previously, you could use a flat range by enabling the Flat Port Range option in a PAT pool rule (Pat Pool tab in an FTD NAT rule). The Flat Port Range option is now ignored: the PAT pool is now always flat. You can optionally select the Include Reserved Ports option to include the 1–1023 port range within the PAT pool.
Note that if you configure port block allocation (the Block Allocation PAT pool option), your block allocation size is used rather than the default 512-port block. In addition, you cannot configure extended PAT for a PAT pool for systems in a cluster.
This change takes effect automatically. You do not need to do anything before or after upgrade.
Supported platforms: FTD
Firepower Threat Defense: Encryption and VPN
AnyConnect module support for RA VPN.
FTD RA VPN now supports AnyConnect modules.
As part of your RA VPN group policy, you can now configure a variety of optional modules to be downloaded and installed when a user downloads the Cisco AnyConnect VPN client. These modules can provide services such as web security, malware protection, off-network roaming protection, and so on.
You must associate each module with a profile containing your custom configurations, created in the AnyConnect Profile Editor and uploaded to the FMC as an AnyConnect File object.
New/modified pages:
Upload module profiles: We added new File Type options to Objects > Object Management > VPN > AnyConnect File > Add AnyConnect File
Configure modules: We added Client Modules options to Objects > Object Management > VPN > Group Policy > add or edit a Group Policy object > AnyConnect settings
Supported platforms: FTD
AnyConnect management VPN tunnels for RA VPN.
FTD RA VPN now supports an AnyConnect management VPN tunnel that allows VPN connectivity to endpoints when the corporate endpoints are powered on, not just when a VPN connection is established by the end user.
This feature helps administrators perform patch management on out-of-the-office endpoints, especially devices that are infrequently connected by the user, via VPN, to the office network. Endpoint operating system login scripts which require corporate network connectivity also benefit.
Supported platforms: FTD
Single sign-on for RA VPN.
FTD RA VPN now supports single sign-on (SSO) for remote access VPN users configured at a SAML 2.0-compliant identity provider (IdP).
New/modified pages:
Connect to an SSO server: Objects > Object Management > AAA Server > Single Sign-on Server
Configure SSO as part of RA VPN: We added SAML as an authentication method (AAA settings) when configuring an RA VPN connection profile.
Supported platforms: FTD
LDAP authorization for RA VPN.
FTD RA VPN now supports LDAP authorization using LDAP attribute maps.
An LDAP attribute map equates attributes that exist in the Active Directory (AD) or LDAP server with Cisco attribute names. Then, when the AD or LDAP server returns authentication to the FTD device during remote access VPN connection establishment, the FTD device can use the information to adjust how the AnyConnect client completes the connection.
Supported platforms: FTD
Virtual Tunnel Interface (VTI) and route-based site-to-site VPN.
FTD site-to-site VPN now supports a logical interface called Virtual Tunnel Interface (VTI).
As an alternative to policy-based VPN, a VPN tunnel can be created between peers with Virtual Tunnel Interfaces configured. This supports route-based VPN with IPsec profiles attached to the end of each tunnel. This allows dynamic or static routes to be used. Using VTI does away with the requirement of configuring static crypto map access lists and mapping them to interfaces. Traffic is encrypted using static route or BGP. You can create a routed security zone, add VTI interfaces to it, and define access control rules for the decrypted traffic control over the VTI tunnel.
VTI-based VPNs can be created between:
Two FTD devices
An FTD device and a public cloud
An FTD device and another FTD device with service provider redundancy
New/modified pages:
Devices > Device Management > Interfaces > Add Interfaces > Virtual Tunnel Interface
Devices > VPN > Site To Site > Add VPN > Firepower Threat Defense Device > Route Based (VTI)
Supported platforms: FTD
Dynamic RRI support for site-to-site VPN.
FTD site-to-site VPN now supports Dynamic Reverse Route Injection (RRI) supported with IKEv2-based static crypto maps in site-to-site VPN deployments. This allowed static routes to be automatically inserted into the routing process for networks and hosts protected by a remote tunnel endpoint.
New/modified pages: We added the Enable Dynamic Reverse Route Injection advanced option when adding an endpoint to a site-to-site VPN topology.
Supported platforms: FTD
Enhancements to manual certificate enrollment.
You can now obtain signed CA certificates and identity certificates from a CA authority independently of each other.
We made the following changes to PKI certificate enrollment objects, which store enrollment parameters for creating Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) and obtaining identity certificates:
We added the CA Only option to the manual enrollment settings for PKI certificate enrollment objects. If you enable this option, you will receive only a signed CA certificate from the CA authority, and not the identity certificate.
You can now leave the CA Certificate field blank in the manual enrollment settings for PKI certificate enrollment objects. If you do this, you will receive only the identity certificate from the CA authority, and not the signed CA certificate.
New/modified pages: Objects > Object Management > PKI > Cert Enrollment > Add Cert Enrollment > CA Information > Enrollment Type > Manual
Supported platforms: FTD
Enhancements to FTD certificate management.
We made the following enhancements to FTD certificate management:
You can now view the chain of certifying authorities (CAs) when viewing certificate contents.
You can now export certificates.
New/modified pages:
Devices > Certificates > Status column > View icon (magnifying glass)
Devices > Certificates > Export icon
Supported platforms: FTD
Access Control: URL Filtering, Application Control, and Security Intelligence
URL filtering and application control on traffic encrypted with TLS 1.3 (TLS Server Identity Discovery).
You can now perform URL filtering and application control on traffic encrypted with TLS 1.3, by using information from the server certificate. You do not have decrypt the traffic for this feature to work.
Note
  We recommend enabling this feature if you want to perform URL filtering and application control on encrypted traffic. However, it can affect device performance, especially on lower-memory models.
New/modified pages: We added a TLS Server Identity Discovery warning and option to the access control policy's Advanced tab.
New/modified FTD CLI commands: We added the B flag to the output of the show conn detail command. On a TLS 1.3-encrypted connection, this flag indicates that we used the server certificate for application and URL detection.
Supported platforms: FTD
URL filtering on traffic to websites with unknown reputation.
You can now perform URL filtering for websites that have an unknown reputation.
New/modified pages: We added an Apply to unknown reputation check box to the access control, QoS, and SSL rule editors.
Supported platforms: FMC
DNS filtering enhances URL filtering.
Beta.
DNS filtering enhances URL filtering by determining the category and reputation of requested domains earlier in the transaction, including in encrypted traffic—but without decrypting the traffic. You enable DNS filtering per access control policy, where it applies to all category/reputation URL rules in that policy.
Note
  DNS filtering is a Beta feature and may not work as expected. Do not use it in production environments.
New/modified pages: We added the Enable reputation enforcement on DNS traffic option to the access control policy's Advanced tab, under General Settings.
Supported platforms: FMC
Shorter update frequencies for Security Intelligence feeds.
The FMC can now update Security Intelligence data every 5 or 15 minutes. Previously, the shortest update frequency was 30 minutes.
If you configure one of these shorter frequencies on a custom feed, you must also configure the system to use an md5 checksum to determine whether the feed has updates to download.
New/modified pages: We added new options to Objects > Object Management > Security Intelligence > Network Lists and Feeds > edit feed > Update Frequency
Supported platforms: FMC
Access Control: User Control
pxGrid 2.0 with ISE/ISE-PIC.
Upgrade impact.
Use pxGrid 2.0 when you connect the FMC to an ISE/ISE-PIC identity source. If you are still using pxGrid 1.0, switch now. That version is deprecated.
For use with pxGrid 2.0, Version 6.7.0 introduces the Cisco ISE Adaptive Network Control (ANC) remediation, which applies or clears ISE-configured ANC policies involved in a correlation policy violation.
If you used the Cisco ISE Endpoint Protection Services (EPS) remediation with pxGrid 1.0, configure and use the ANC remediation with pxGrid 2.0. ISE remediations will not launch if you are using the 'wrong' pxGrid. The ISE Connection Status Monitor health module alerts you to mismatches.
For detailed compatibility information for all supported Firepower versions, including integrated products, see the Cisco Firepower Compatibility Guide.
New/modified pages:
Policies > Actions > Modules > Installed Remediation Modules list
Policies > Actions > Instances > Select a module type drop-down list
Supported platforms: FMC
Realm sequences.
You can now group realms into ordered realm sequences.
Add a realm sequence to an identity rule in the same way as you add a single realm. When applying the identity rule to network traffic, the system searches the Active Directory domains in the order specified. You cannot create realm sequences for LDAP realms.
New/modified pages: System > Integration > Realm Sequences
Supported platforms: FMC
ISE subnet filtering.
Especially useful on lower-memory devices, you can now use the CLI to exclude subnets from receiving user-to-IP and Security Group Tag (SGT)-to-IP mappings from ISE.
The Snort Identity Memory Usage health module alerts when memory usage exceeds a certain level, which by default is 80%.
New device CLI command: configure identity-subnet-filter { add | remove}
Supported platforms: FMC-managed devices
Access Control: Intrusion and Malware Prevention
Improved preclassification of files for dynamic analysis.
Upgrade impact.
The system can now decide not to submit a suspected malware file for dynamic analysis, based on the static analysis results (for example, a file with no dynamic elements).
After you upgrade, in the Captured Files table, these files will have a Dynamic Analysis Status of Rejected for Analysis.
Supported platforms: FMC
S7Commplus preprocessor.
The new S7Commplus preprocessor supports the widely accepted S7 industrial protocol. You can use it to apply corresponding intrusion and preprocessor rules, drop malicious traffic, and generate intrusion events.
New/modified pages:
Enable the preprocessor: In the network analysis policy editor, click Settings (you must click the word 'Settings'), and enable S7Commplus Configuration under SCADA Preprocessors.
Configure the preprocessor: In the network analysis policy editor, under Settings, click S7Commplus Configuration.
Configure S7Commplus preprocessor rules: In the intrusion policy editor, click Rules > Preprocessors > S7 Commplus Configurations.
Supported platforms: all FTD devices, including ISA 3000
Custom intrusion rule import warns when rules collide.
The FMC now warns you of rule collisions when you import custom (local) intrusion rules. Previously, the FMC would silently skip the rules that cause collisions—with the exception of Version 6.6.0.1, where a rule import with collisions would fail entirely.
On the Rule Updates page, if a rule import had collisions, a warning icon is displayed in the Status column. For more information, hover your pointer over the warning icon and read the tooltip.
Note that a collision occurs when you try to import an intrusion rule that has the same SID/revision number as an existing rule. You should always make sure that updated versions of custom rules have new revision numbers. We recommend you read the best practices for importing local intrusion rules in the FMC configuration guide.
New/modified pages: We added a warning icon to System > Updates > Rule Updates.
Supported platforms: FMC
Access Control: TLS/SSL Decryption
ClientHello modification for Decrypt - Known Key TLS/SSL rules.
Upgrade impact.
If you configure TLS/SSL decryption, when a managed device receives a ClientHello message, the system now attempts to match the message to TLS/SSL rules that have the Decrypt - Known Key action. Previously, the system only matched ClientHello messages to Decrypt - Resign rules.
The match relies on data from the ClientHello message and from cached server certificate data. If the message matches, the device modifies the ClientHello message in specific ways; see the ClientHello Message Handling topic in the FMC configuration guide.
This behavior change occurs automatically after upgrade. If you use Decrypt - Known Key TLS/SSL rules, make sure that encrypted traffic is being handled as expected.
Supported platforms: Any device
Event Logging and Analysis
Remote data storage and cross-launch with an on-prem Stealthwatch solution.
You can now store large volumes of Firepower event data off-FMC, using an on-premises Stealthwatch solution: Cisco Security Analytics and Logging (On Premises).
When viewing events in FMC, you can quickly cross-launch to view events in your remote data storage location. The FMC uses syslog to send connection, Security Intelligence, intrusion, file, and malware events.
Note
  This on-prem solution is supported for FMCs running Version 6.4.0+. However, contextual cross-launch requires Firepower Version 6.7.0+. This solution also depends on availability of the Security Analytics and Logging On Prem app for the Stealthwatch Management Console (SMC), which must be running Stealthwatch Enterprise (SWE) version 7.3.
Supported platforms: FMC
Quickly add Stealthwatch contextual cross-launch resources.
A new page on the FMC allows you to quickly add contextual cross-launch resources for your Stealthwatch appliance.
After you add Stealthwatch resources, you manage them on the general contextual cross-launch page. This is where you continue to manually create and manage non-Stealthwatch cross-launch resources.
New/modified pages:
Add Stealthwatch resources: System > Logging > Security Analytics and Logging
Manage resources: Analysis > Advanced > Contextual Cross-Launch
Supported platform: FMC
New cross-launch options field types.
You can now cross-launch into an external resource using the following additional types of event data:
Access control policy
Intrusion policy
Application protocol
Client application
Web application
Username (including realm)
New/modified pages:
New variables when creating or editing cross-launch query links: Analysis > Advanced > Contextual Cross-Launch.
New data types in the dashboard and event viewer now offer cross-launch on right click.
Supported platforms: FMC
National Vulnerability Database (NVD) replaces Bugtraq.
Upgrade impact.
Bugtraq vulnerability data is no longer available. Most vulnerability data now comes from the NVD. To support this change, we made the following changes:
Added the CVE ID and Severity fields to the Vulnerabilities table. Right-clicking the CVE ID in the table view allows you to view details about the vulnerability on the NVD.
Renamed the Vulnerability Impact field to Impact (in the table view only).
Removed the obsolete/redundant Bugtraq ID, Title, Available Exploits, Technical Description, and Solution fields.
Removed the Bugtraq ID filtering option from the Hosts network map.
If you export vulnerability data, make sure any integrations are working as expected after the upgrade.
Supported platforms: FMC
Upgrade
Pre-upgrade compatibility check.
Upgrade impact.
In FMC deployments, Firepower appliances must now pass pre-upgrade compatibility checks before you can run more complex readiness checks or attempt to upgrade. This check catches issues that will cause your upgrade to fail—but we now catch them earlier and block you from proceeding.
The checks are as follows:
You cannot use the FMC to upgrade a Firepower 4100/9300 chassis to Version 6.7.0+ until you upgrade FXOS to the new release's companion FXOS version.
Upgrade is blocked as long as you are upgrading the device to Version 6.7.0 or later. For example, you are not blocked from attempting a Firepower 4100/9300 upgrade from 6.3 → 6.6.x, even if the device is running a version of FXOS that is too old for Firepower Version 6.6.x.
You cannot use the FMC to upgrade a device if that device has out-of-date configurations.
Upgrade is blocked as long as the FMC is running Version 6.7.0 or later, and you are upgrading a managed device to a valid target. For example, you are blocked from upgrading a device from 6.3.0 → 6.6.x if the device has outdated configurations.
You cannot upgrade an FMC from Version 6.7.0+ if its devices have out-of-date configurations.
Upgrade is blocked as long as the FMC is running Version 6.7.0 or later. For upgrades from earlier versions (including to Version 6.7.0), you must make sure you deploy yourself.
When you select an upgrade package to install, the FMC displays compatibility check results for all eligible appliances. The new Readiness Check page also displays this information. You cannot upgrade until you fix the issues indicated.
New/modified pages:

Supported platforms: FMC, FTD
Improved readiness checks.
Upgrade impact.
Readiness checks assess a Firepower appliance's preparedness for a software upgrade. These checks include database integrity, file system integrity, configuration integrity, disk space, and so on.
After you upgrade the FMC to Version 6.7.0, you will see the following improvements to FTD upgrade readiness checks:
Readiness checks are faster.
Readiness checks are now supported on high availability and clustered FTD devices, without having to log into the device CLI.
Readiness checks for FTD device upgrades to Version 6.7.0+ no longer require the upgrade package to reside on the device. Although we still recommend you push the upgrade package to the device before you begin the upgrade itself, you no longer have to do so before you run the readiness check.
When you select an upgrade package to install, the FMC now shows the readiness status for all applicable FTD devices. A new Readiness Checks page allows you to view the results of readiness checks for the FTD devices in your deployment. You can also re-run readiness checks from this page.
Readiness check results include the estimated upgrade time (but do not include reboot time).
Error messages are better. You can also download success/failure logs from the Message Center on the FMC.
Note that these improvements are supported for FTD upgrades from Version 6.3.0+, as long as the FMC is running Version 6.7.0+.
New/modified pages:

Supported platforms: FTD
Improved FTD upgrade status reporting and cancel/retry options.
Upgrade impact.
You can now view the status of device upgrades and readiness checks in progress on the Device Management page, as well as a 7-day history of upgrade success/failures. The Message Center also provides enhanced status and error messages.
A new Upgrade Status pop-up, accessible from both Device Management and the Message Center with a single click, shows detailed upgrade information, including percentage/time remaining, specific upgrade stage, success/failure data, upgrade logs, and so on.
Also on this pop-up, you can manually cancel failed or in-progress upgrades (Cancel Upgrade), or retry failed upgrades (Retry Upgrade). Canceling an upgrade reverts the device to its pre-upgrade state.
Note
  To be able to manually cancel or retry a failed upgrade, you must disable the new auto-cancel option, which appears when you use the FMC to upgrade an FTD device: Automatically cancel on upgrade failure and roll back to the previous version. With the option enabled, the device automatically reverts to its pre-upgrade state upon upgrade failure.
Auto-cancel is not supported for patches. In an HA or clustered deployment, auto-cancel applies to each device individually. That is, if the upgrade fails on one device, only that device is reverted.
New/modified pages:
System > Update > Product Updates > Available Updates > Install icon for the FTD upgrade package

Upgrades postpone scheduled tasks.
Upgrade impact.
FMC upgrades now postpone scheduled tasks. Any task scheduled to begin during the upgrade will begin five minutes after the post-upgrade reboot.
Note
  Before you begin any upgrade, you must still make sure running tasks are complete. Tasks running when the upgrade begins are stopped, become failed tasks, and cannot be resumed.
Note that this feature is supported for all upgrades from a supported version. This includes Version 6.4.0.10 and later patches, Version 6.6.3 and later maintenance releases, and Version 6.7.0+. This feature is not supported for upgrades to a supported version from an unsupported version.
Supported platforms: FMC
Upgrades remove PCAP files to save disk space.
Upgrade impact.
To upgrade a Firepower appliance, you must have enough free disk space or the upgrade fails. Upgrades now remove locally stored PCAP files.
Supported platforms: Any
Deployment and Policy Management
Configuration rollback.
Beta.
You can now "roll back" configurations on an FTD device, replacing them with the previously deployed configurations.
Note
  Rollback is a Beta feature, and is not supported in all deployment types and scenarios. It is also a disruptive operation. Make sure you read and understand the guidelines and limitations in the Policy Management chapter of the FMC configuration guide.
New/modified pages: Deploy > Deployment History > Rollback column and icons.
Supported platforms: FTD
Deploy intrusion and file policies independently of access control policies.
You can now select and deploy intrusion and file policies independently of access control policies, unless there are dependent changes.
New/modified pages: Deploy > Deployment
Supported platforms: FMC
Search access control rule comments.
You can now search within access control rules comments.
New/modified pages: In the access control policy editor, we added the Comments field to the Search Rules drop-down dialog.
Supported platforms: FMC
Search and filter FTD NAT rules.
You can now search for rules in an FTD NAT policy to help you find rules based on IP addresses, ports, object names, and so forth. Search results include partial matches. Searching on criteria filters the rule table so only matching rules are displayed.
New/modified pages: We added a search field above the rule table when you edit an FTD NAT policy.
Supported platforms: FTD
Copy and move rules between access control and prefilter policies.
You can copy access control rules from one access control policy to another. You can also move rules between an access control policy and its associated prefilter policy.
New/modified pages: In the access control and prefilter policy editors, we added Copy and Move options to each rule's right-click menu.
Supported platforms: FMC
Bulk object import.
You can now bulk-import network, port, URL, VLAN tag, and distinguished name objects onto the FMC, using a comma-separated-values (CSV) file.
For restrictions and specific formatting instructions, see the Reusable Objects chapter of the FMC configuration guide.
New/modified pages: Objects > Object Management > choose an object type > Add [Object Type] > Import Object
Supported platforms: FMC
Interface object optimization for access control and prefilter policies.
You can now enable interface object optimization on specific FTD devices.
During deployment, interface groups and security zones used in the access control and prefilter policies generate separate rules for each source/destination interface pair. If you enable interface object optimization, the system will instead deploy a single rule per access control/prefilter rule, which can simplify the device configuration and improve deployment performance.
Interface object optimization is disabled by default. If you enable it, you should also enable Object Group Search—which now applies to interface objects in addition to network objects—to reduce memory usage on the device.

Health monitoring enhancements.
We enhanced health monitoring as follows:
Health Status summary page that provides an at-a-glance view of the health of the Firepower Management Center and all of the devices that the FMC manages.
The Monitoring navigation pane allows you to navigate the device hierarchy.
Managed devices are listed individually, or grouped according to their geolocation, high availability, or cluster status where applicable.
You can view health monitors for individual devices from the navigation pane.
Custom dashboards to correlate interrelated metrics. Select from predefined correlation groups, such as CPU and Snort; or create a custom correlation dashboard by building your own variable set from the available metric groups.
Supported platforms: FMC
Health module updates.
We replaced the CPU Usage health module with four new modules:
CPU Usage (per core): Monitors the CPU usage on all of the cores.
CPU Usage Data Plane: Monitors the average CPU usage of all data plane processes on the device.
CPU Usage Snort: Monitors the average CPU usage of the Snort processes on the device.
CPU Usage System: Monitors the average CPU usage of all system processes on the device.
We added the following health modules to track memory use:
Memory Usage Data Plane: Monitors the percentage of allocated memory used by data plane processes.
Memory Usage Snort: Monitors the percentage of allocated memory used by the Snort process.
We added the following health modules to track statistics:
Connection Statistics: Monitors connection statistics and NAT translation counts.
Critical Process Statistics: Monitors the state of critical processes, their resource consumption, and the restart counts.
Deployed Configuration Statistics: Monitors statistics about the deployed configuration, such as the number of ACEs and IPS rules.
Snort Statistics: Monitors Snort statistics for events, flows, and packets.

Deprecated Features
Table 19. Deprecated Features in FMC Version 6.7.0
Deprecated Feature
Description
End of support: ASA 5525-X, 5545-X, and 5555-X devices with Firepower software.
You cannot run Version 6.7+ on the ASA 5525-X, 5545-X, and 5555-X.
Deprecated: Cisco Firepower User Agent software and identity source.
Prevents FMC upgrade.
You cannot upgrade an FMC with user agent configurations to Version 6.7+.
Version 6.6 is the last release to support the Cisco Firepower User Agent software as an identity source. You should switch to Cisco Identity Services Engine/Passive Identity Connector (ISE/ISE-PIC). To convert your license, contact Sales.
For more information, see the End-of-Life and End-of-Support for the Cisco Firepower User Agent announcement and the Firepower User Identity: Migrating from User Agent to Identity Services Engine TechNote.
Deprecated FTD CLI commands: configure user agent
Deprecated: Cisco ISE Endpoint Protection Services (EPS) remediation.
ISE remediations can stop working.
The Cisco ISE Endpoint Protection Services (EPS) remediation does not work with pxGrid 2.0. Configure and use the new Cisco ISE Adaptive Network Control (ANC) remediation instead.
ISE remediations will not launch if you are using the 'wrong' pxGrid to connect the FMC to an ISE/ISE-PIC identity source. The ISE Connection Status Monitor health module alerts you to mismatches.
Deprecated: Less secure Diffie-Hellman groups, and encryption and hash algorithms.
Prevents FMC upgrade.
You may not be able to upgrade an FMC if you use any of the following FTD features:
Diffie-Hellman groups: 2, 5, and 24.
Group 5 continues to be supported in FMC deployments for IKEv1, but we recommend you change to a stronger option.
Encryption algorithms for users who satisfy export controls for strong encryption: DES, 3DES, AES-GMAC, AES-GMAC-192, AES-GMAC-256. DES continues to be supported (and is the only option) for users who do not satisfy export controls.
The NULL "encryption algorithm" (authentication without encryption, for testing purposes) continues to be supported in FMC deployments for both IKEv1 and IKEv2 IPsec proposals. However, it is no longer supported in IKEv2 policies.
Hash algorithms: MD5.
If you are still using these features in IKE proposals or IPsec policies, change and verify your VPN configuration before you upgrade.
Deprecated: Appliance Configuration Resource Utilization heath module (temporary).
Possible post-upgrade errors in the health monitor.
Version 6.7 partially and temporarily deprecates support for the Appliance Configuration Resource Utilization health module, which was introduced in Version 6.6.3 and is supported in all later 6.6.x releases.
Version 6.7 support is as follows:
FMC upgraded to Version 6.7 from Version 6.6.3+
Continues to support the module, but only if the devices remain at Version 6.6.x. If you upgrade the devices to Version 6.7, the module stops working and the health monitor displays an error. To resolve the error, use the FMC to disable the module and reapply policies.
FMC upgraded to Version 6.7 from Version 6.3–6.6.1, or FMC freshly installed to Version 6.7.
Does not support the module.
In the rare case that you add a Version 6.6.x device that has the module enabled to an FMC where the module is not supported, the health monitor displays an error that you cannot resolve. This error is safe to ignore.
Full support returns in Version 7.0, where the module is renamed to Configuration Memory Allocation.
Deprecated: Other health modules (permanent).
Version 6.7 deprecates the following health modules:
CPU Usage: Replaced by four new modules; see the new features table above.
Local Malware Analysis: This module was replaced by the Threat Data Updates on Devices module in Version 6.3. A Version 6.7+ FMC can no longer manage any devices where the older module applies.
User Agent Status Monitor: Cisco Firepower User Agent is no longer supported.
Deprecated: Walkthroughs with the Classic theme.
Version 6.7 discontinues FMC walkthroughs (how-tos) for the Classic theme. You can switch themes in your user preferences.
Deprecated: Bugtraq
Version 6.7 removes database fields and options for Bugtraq. Bugtraq vulnerability data is no longer available. Most vulnerability data now comes from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).
If you export vulnerability data, make sure any integrations are working as expected after the upgrade.
Deprecated: Microsoft Internet Explorer
We no longer test Firepower web interfaces using Microsoft Internet Explorer. We recommend you switch to Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.
Deprecated: Geolocation details.
In May 2022 we split the GeoDB into two packages: a country code package that maps IP addresses to countries/continents, and an IP package that contains additional contextual data associated with routable IP addresses. The contextual data in the IP package can include additional location details, as well as connection information such as ISP, connection type, proxy type, domain name, and so on.
The new country code package has the same file name as the old all-in-one package: Cisco_GEODB_Update-date-build. This allows deployments running Version 7.1 and earlier to continue to obtain GeoDB updates. If you manually download GeoDB updates—for example, in an air-gapped deployment—make sure you get the country code package and not the IP package.
Important
  This split does not affect geolocation rules or traffic handling in any way—those rules rely only on the data in the country code package. However, because the country code package essentially replaces the all-in-one package, the contextual data is no longer updated and will grow stale. To obtain fresh data, upgrade or reimage the FMC to Version 7.2+ and update the GeoDB.
New Features in FMC Version 6.6
New Features
Table 20. New Features in FMC Version 6.6.3
New Feature
Description
Upgrades postpone scheduled tasks.
Upgrade impact.
Upgrades now postpone scheduled tasks. Any task scheduled to begin during the upgrade will begin five minutes after the post-upgrade reboot.
Note
  Before you begin any upgrade, you must still make sure running tasks are complete. Tasks running when the upgrade begins are stopped, become failed tasks, and cannot be resumed.
Note that this feature is supported for Firepower appliances running Version 6.6.3+. It is not supported for upgrades to Version 6.6.3, unless you are upgrading from Version 6.4.0.10 or any later patch.
Appliance Configuration Resource Utilization health module.
Upgrade impact for Version 6.7.0.
Version 6.6.3 improves device memory management and introduces a new health module: Appliance Configuration Resource Utilization.
The module alerts when the size of your deployed configurations puts a device at risk of running out of memory. The alert shows you how much memory your configurations require, and by how much this exceeds the available memory. If this happens, re-evaluate your configurations. Most often you can reduce the number or complexity of access control rules or intrusion policies. For information on best practices for access control, see the configuration guide.
The upgrade process automatically adds and enables this module in all health policies. After upgrade, apply health policies to managed devices to begin monitoring.
Note
  This module requires Version 6.6.3 or later 6.6.x release or Version 7.0+ on both the FMC and managed devices.
Version 6.7 partially and temporarily deprecates support for this module. For details, see New Features in FMC Version 6.7. Full support returns in Version 7.0, where the module is renamed to Configuration Memory Allocation.
Table 21. New Features in FMC Version 6.6.0
New Feature
Description
Platform
FTD on the Firepower 4112.
We introduced the Firepower 4112. You can also deploy ASA logical devices on this platform. Requires FXOS 2.8.1.
Larger instances for AWS deployments.
Upgrade impact.
FTDv for AWS adds support for these larger instances:
C5.xlarge
C5.2xlarge
C5.4xlarge
FMCv for AWS adds support for these larger instances:
C3.4xlarge
C4.4xlarge
C5.4xlarge
All existing FMCv for AWS instance types are now deprecated (c3.xlarge, c3.2xlarge, c4.xlarge, c4.2xlarge). You must resize before you upgrade. For more information, see the upgrade guidelines for Version 6.6 in the release notes.
Autoscale for cloud-based FTDv deployments.
We introduced support for AWS Auto Scale/Azure Autoscale.
The serverless infrastructure in cloud-based deployments allow you to automatically adjust the number of FTDv instances in the Auto Scale group based on capacity needs. This includes automatic registering/unregistering to and from the managing FMC.
Supported platforms: FTDv for AWS, FTDv for Azure
Firepower Threat Defense: Device Management
Obtain initial management interface IP address using DHCP.
For Firepower 1000/2000 series and ASA-5500-X series devices, the management interface now defaults to obtaining an IP address from DHCP. This change makes it easier for you to deploy a new device on your existing network.
This feature is not supported for Firepower 4100/9300 chassis, where you set the IP address when you deploy the logical device. Nor is it supported for FTDv or the ISA 3000, which continue to default to 192.168.45.45.
Supported platforms: Firepower 1000/2000 series, ASA-5500-X series
Configure MTU values in CLI.
You can now use the FTD CLI to configure MTU (maximum transmission unit) values for FTD device interfaces. The default is 1500 bytes. Maximum MTU values are:
Management interface: 1500 bytes
Eventing interface: 9000 bytes
New FTD CLI commands: configure network mtu
Modified FTD CLI commands: Added the mtu-event-channel and mtu-management-channel keyword to the configure network management-interface command.
Supported platforms: FTD
Get threat defense upgrade packages from an internal web server.
FTD devices can now get upgrade packages from your own internal web server, rather than from the FMC. This is especially useful if you have limited bandwidth between the FMC and its devices. It also saves space on the FMC.
Note
  This feature is supported only for FTD devices running Version 6.6.0+. It is not supported for upgrades to Version 6.6.0, nor is it supported for the FMC or Classic devices.
New/modified pages: System > Updates > Upload Update button > Specify software update source option
Supported platforms: FTD
Connection-based troubleshooting enhancements.
We made the following enhancements to FTD CLI connection-based troubleshooting (debugging):
debug packet-module trace : Added to enable module level packet tracing.
debug packet-condition : Modified to support troubleshooting of ongoing connections.
Supported platforms: FTD
Firepower Threat Defense: Clustering
Multi-instance clustering.
You can now create a cluster using container instances. On the Firepower 9300, you must include one container instance on each module in the cluster. You cannot add more than one container instance to the cluster per security engine/module.
We recommend that you use the same security module or chassis model for each cluster instance. However, you can mix and match container instances on different Firepower 9300 security module types or Firepower 4100 models in the same cluster if required. You cannot mix Firepower 9300 and 4100 instances in the same cluster.
New FXOS CLI commands: set port-type cluster
New/modified Chassis Manager pages:
Logical Devices > Add Cluster
Interfaces > All Interfaces > Add New drop-down menu > Subinterface > Type field
Supported platforms: Firepower 4100/9300
Parallel configuration sync to data units in FTD clusters.
The control unit in an FTD cluster now syncs configuration changes with slave units in parallel by default. Formerly, synching occurred sequentially.
Supported platforms: Firepower 4100/9300
Messages for cluster join failure or eviction added to show cluster history .
We added new messages to the show cluster history command for when a cluster unit either fails to join the cluster or leaves the cluster.
Supported platforms: Firepower 4100/9300
Firepower Threat Defense: Routing
Virtual routers and VRF-Lite.
You can now create multiple virtual routers to maintain separate routing tables for groups of interfaces. Because each virtual router has its own routing table, you can provide clean separation in the traffic flowing through the device.
Virtual routers implement the “light” version of Virtual Routing and Forwarding, or VRF-Lite, which does not support Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP (MBGP).
The maximum number of virtual routers you can create ranges from five to 100, and depends on the device model. For a full list, see the Virtual Routing for Firepower Threat Defense chapter in the Firepower Management Center Configuration Guide.
New/modified pages: Devices > Device Management > edit device > Routing tab
New FTD CLI commands: show vrf .
Modified FTD CLI commands: Added the [ vrf name | all] keyword set to the following CLI commands, and changed the output to indicate virtual router information where applicable: clear ospf , clear route , ping , show asp table routing , show bgp , show ipv6 route , show ospf , show route , show snort counters .
Supported platforms: FTD, except Firepower 1010 and ISA 3000
Firepower Threat Defense: VPN
DTLS 1.2 in remote access VPN.
You can now use Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) 1.2 to encrypt RA VPN connections.
Use FTD platform settings to specify the minimum TLS protocol version that the FTD device uses when acting as a, RA VPN server. If you want to specify DTLS 1.2, you must also choose TLS 1.2 as the minimum TLS version.
Requires Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client, Version 4.7+.
New/modified pages: Devices > Platform Settings > add/edit Threat Defense policy > SSL > DTLS Version option
Supported platforms: FTD, except ASA 5508-X and ASA 5516-X
Site-to-site VPN IKEv2 support for multiple peers.
You can now add a backup peer to a site-to-site VPN connection, for IKEv1 and IKEv2 point-to-point extranet and hub-and-spoke topologies. Previously, you could only configure backup peers for IKEv1 point-to-point topologies.
New/modified pages: Devices > VPN > Site to Site > add or edit a point to point or hub and spoke FTD VPN topology > add endpoint > IP Address field now supports comma-separated backup peers
Supported platforms: FTD
Security Policies
Usability enhancements for security policies.
Version 6.6.0 makes it easier to work with access control and prefilter rules. You can now:
Edit certain attributes of multiple access control rules in a single operation: state, action, logging, intrusion policy, and so on.
In the access control policy editor, select the relevant rules, right-click, and choose Edit.
Search access control rules by multiple parameters.
In the access control policy editor, click the Search Rules text box to see your options.
View object details and usage in an access control or prefilter rule.
In the access control or prefilter policy editor, right-click the rule and choose Object Details.
Supported platforms: FMC
Object group search for access control policies.
While operating, FTD devices expand access control rules into multiple access control list entries based on the contents of any network objects used in the access rule. You can reduce the memory required to search access control rules by enabling object group search.
With object group search enabled, the system does not expand network objects, but instead searches access rules for matches based on those group definitions.
Object group search does not impact how your rules are defined or how they appear in the FMC. It impacts only how the device interprets and processes them while matching connections to access control rules. Object group search is disabled by default.
New/modified pages: Devices > Device Management > edit device > Device tab > Advanced Settings > Object Group Search option
Supported platforms: FTD
Time-based rules in access control and prefilter policies.
You can now specify an absolute or recurring time or time range for a rule to be applied. The rule is applied based on the time zone of the device that processes the traffic.
New/modified pages:
Access control and prefilter rule editors
Devices > Platform Settings > add/edit Threat Defense policy > Time Zone
Objects > Object Management > Time Range and Time Zone
Supported platforms: FTD
Egress optimization re-enabled.
Upgrade impact.
Version 6.6.0 fixes CSCvs86257. If egress optimization was:
Enabled but turned off, the upgrade turns it back on. (We turned off egress optimization in some Version 6.4.0.x and 6.5.0.x patches, even if the feature was enabled.)
Manually disabled, we recommend you reenable it post-upgrade: asp inspect-dp egress-optimization .
Supported platforms: FTD
Event Logging and Analysis
New datastore improves performance.
Upgrade impact.
To improve performance, Version 6.6.0 uses a new datastore for connection and Security Intelligence events.
After the upgrade finishes and the FMC reboots, historical connection and Security Intelligence events are migrated in the background, resource constrained. Depending on FMC model, system load, and how many events you have stored, this can take from a few hours up to a day.
Historical events are migrated by age, newest events first. Events that have not been migrated do not appear in query results or dashboards. If you reach the connection event database limit before the migration completes, for example, because of post-upgrade events, the oldest historical events are not migrated.
You can monitor event migration progress in the Message Center.
Supported platforms: FMC
Wildcard support when searching connection and Security Intelligence events for URLs.
When searching connection and Security Intelligence events for URLs having the pattern example.com, you must now include wildcards. Specifically, use *example.com* for such searches.
Supported platforms: FMC
Monitor up to 300,000 concurrent user sessions with FTD devices.
In Version 6.6.0, some FTD device models support monitoring of additional concurrent user sessions (logins):
300,000 sessions: Firepower 4140, 4145, 4150, 9300
150,000 sessions: Firepower 2140, 4112, 4115, 4120, 4125
All other devices continue to support the old limit of 64,000, except ASA FirePOWER which is limited to 2000.
A new health module alerts you when the user identity feature's memory usage reaches a configurable threshold. You can also view a graph of the memory usage over time.
New/modified pages:
System > Health > Policy > add or edit health policy > Snort Identity Memory Usage
System > Health > Monitor > select a device > Graph option for the Snort Identity Memory Usage module
Supported platforms: FTD devices listed above
Integration with IBM QRadar.

For more information, see the Integration Guide for the Cisco Firepower App for IBM QRadar.
Supported platforms: FMC
Administration and Troubleshooting
New options for deploying configuration changes.
The Deploy button on the FMC menu bar is now a menu, with options that add the following functionality:
Status: For each device, the system displays whether changes need to be deployed; whether there are warnings or errors you should resolve before you deploy; and whether your last deploy is in process, failed, or completed successfully.
Preview: See all applicable policy and object changes you have made since you last deployed to the device.
Selective deploy: Choose from the policies and configurations you want to deploy to a managed device.
Deploy time estimate: Display an estimate of how long it will take to deploy to a particular device. You can display estimates for a full deploy, as well as for specific policies and configurations.
History: View details of previous deploys.

Initial configuration updates the VDB and schedules SRU updates.
On new and reimaged FMCs, the setup process now:
Downloads and installs the latest vulnerability database (VDB) update.
Enables daily intrusion rule (SRU) downloads. Note that the setup process does not enable auto-deploy after these downloads, although you can change this setting.
Upgraded FMCs are not affected.
New/modified pages:
System > Updates > Product Updates (VDB updates)

VDB match no longer required to restore FMC.
Restoring an FMC from backup no longer requires the same VDB on the replacement FMC. However, restoring does now replace the existing VDB with the VDB in the backup file.
Supported platforms: FMC
HTTPS certificates with subject alternative name (SAN).
You can now request a HTTPS server certificate that secures multiple domain names or IP addresses by using SAN. For more information on SAN, see RFC 5280, section 4.2.1.6.

Cisco Support Diagnostics on additional FTD platforms.
Upgrade impact.
Cisco Support Diagnostics is now fully supported on all FMCs and FTD devices. Previously, support was limited to FMCs, Firepower 4100/9300 with FTD, and FTDv for Azure.
Supported platforms: FMC, FTD
Usability
Light theme.
The FMC now defaults to the Light theme, which was introduced as a Beta feature in Version 6.5.0. Upgrading to Version 6.6.0 automatically switches you to the Light theme. You can switch back to the Classic theme in your user preferences.
Although we cannot respond to everybody, we welcome feedback on the Light theme. Use the feedback link on the User Preferences page or contact us at fmc-light-theme-feedback@cisco.com.

Supported platforms: FMC
Security and Hardening
Default HTTPS server certificate renewals have 800 day lifespans.
Upgrade impact.
Unless the current default HTTPS server certificate already has an 800-day lifespan, upgrading to Version 6.6.0 renews the certificate, which now expires 800 days from the date of the upgrade. All future renewals have an 800 day lifespan.
Your old certificate was set to expire depending on when it was generated.
Supported platforms: FMC
Firepower Management Center REST API
New REST API capabilities.
Added the following REST API services to support Version 6.6.0 features:
bgp, bgpgeneralsettings, ospfinterface, ospfv2routes, ospfv3interfaces, ospfv3routes, virtualrouters, routemaps, ipv4prefixlists, ipv6prefixlists, aspathlists, communitylists, extendedcommunitylists, standardaccesslists, standardcommunitylists, policylists: Routing
virtualrouters, virtualipv4staticroutes, virtualipv6staticroutes, virtualstaticroutes: Virtual routing
timeranges, globaltimezones, timezoneobjects: Time-based rules

pendingchanges: Deploy improvements
Added the following REST API services to support older features:
intrusionrules, intrusionpolicies: Intrusion policies
Supported platforms: FMC
Changed REST API service name for extended access lists.
Upgrade impact.
The extendedaccesslist (singular) service in the FMC REST API is now extendedaccesslists (plural). Make sure you update your client. Using the old service name fails and returns an Invalid URL error.
Request Type: GET
URL to retrieve the extended access list associated with a specific ID:
Old: /api/fmc_config/v1/domain/{domainUUID}/object/extendedaccesslist/{objectId}
New: /api/fmc_config/v1/domain/{domainUUID}/object/extendedaccesslists/{objectId}
URL to retrieve a list of all extended access lists:
Old: /api/fmc_config/v1/domain/{domainUUID}/object/extendedaccesslist
New: /api/fmc_config/v1/domain/{domainUUID}/object/extendedaccesslists

Deprecated Features
Table 22. Deprecated Features in Version 6.6.1
Deprecated Feature
Description
Custom intrusion rule import does not fail when rules collide.
In Version 6.6.0, the FMC began rejecting custom (local) intrusion rule imports entirely if there were rule collisions. Version 6.6.1 deprecates this feature, and returns to the pre-Version 6.6 behavior of silently skipping the rules that cause collisions.
Note that a collision occurs when you try to import an intrusion rule that has the same SID/revision number as an existing rule. You should always make sure that updated versions of custom rules have new revision numbers. We recommend you read the best practices for importing local intrusion rules in the FMC configuration guide.
Version 6.7 adds a warning for rule collisions.
Table 23. Deprecated Features in Version 6.6.0
Deprecated Feature
Description
Deprecated: Lower-memory instances for cloud-based FMCv deployments.
For performance reasons, the following FMCv instances are no longer supported:
c3.xlarge on AWS
c3.2xlarge on AWS
c4.xlarge on AWS
c4.2xlarge on AWS
Standard_D3_v2 on Azure
You must resize before you upgrade to Version 6.6.0+. For more information, see the upgrade guidelines for Version 6.6 in the release notes.
Additionally, as of the Version 6.6 release, lower-memory instance types for cloud-based FMCv deployments are fully deprecated. You cannot create new FMCv instances using them, even for earlier Firepower versions. You can continue running existing instances.
Deprecated: e1000 Interfaces on FTDv for VMware.
Prevents upgrade.
Version 6.6 ends support for e1000 interfaces on FTDv for VMware. You cannot upgrade until you switch to vmxnet3 or ixgbe interfaces. Or, you can deploy a new device.
For more information, see the Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Virtual Getting Started Guide.
Deprecated: Less secure Diffie-Hellman groups, and encryption and hash algorithms.
Version 6.6 deprecates the following FTD security features:
Diffie-Hellman groups: 2, 5, and 24.
Encryption algorithms for users who satisfy export controls for strong encryption: DES, 3DES, AES-GMAC, AES-GMAC-192, AES-GMAC-256. DES continues to be supported (and is the only option) for users who do not satisfy export controls.
Hash algorithms: MD5.
These features are removed in Version 6.7. Avoid configuring them in IKE proposals or IPSec policies for use in VPNs. Change to stronger options as soon as possible.
Deprecated: Custom tables for connection events.
Version 6.6 ends support for custom tables for connection and Security Intelligence events. After you upgrade, existing custom tables for those events are still 'available' but return no results. We recommend you delete them.
There is no change to other types of custom tables.
Deprecated options:
Analysis > Advanced > Custom Tables > click Create Custom Table > Tables drop-down list > Connection Events and Security Intelligence Events
Deprecated: Ability to delete connection events from the event viewer.
Version 6.6 ends support for deleting connection and Security Intelligence events from the event viewer. To purge the database, select System > Tools > Data Purge.
Deprecated options:
Analysis > Connections > Events > Delete and Delete All
Analysis > Connections > Security Intelligence Events > Delete and Delete All
Deprecated: Geolocation details.
In May 2022 we split the GeoDB into two packages: a country code package that maps IP addresses to countries/continents, and an IP package that contains additional contextual data associated with routable IP addresses. The contextual data in the IP package can include additional location details, as well as connection information such as ISP, connection type, proxy type, domain name, and so on.
The new country code package has the same file name as the old all-in-one package: Cisco_GEODB_Update-date-build. This allows deployments running Version 7.1 and earlier to continue to obtain GeoDB updates. If you manually download GeoDB updates—for example, in an air-gapped deployment—make sure you get the country code package and not the IP package.
Important
  This split does not affect geolocation rules or traffic handling in any way—those rules rely only on the data in the country code package. However, because the country code package essentially replaces the all-in-one package, the contextual data is no longer updated and will grow stale. To obtain fresh data, upgrade or reimage the FMC to Version 7.2+ and update the GeoDB.

Supported platforms: FTD
TLS crypto acceleration for multiple container instances on Firepower 4100/9300
TLS crypto acceleration is now supported on multiple container instances (up to 16) on a Firepower 4100/9300 chassis. Previously, you could enable TLS crypto acceleration for only one container instance per module/security engine.
New instances have this feature enabled by default. However, the upgrade does not enable acceleration on existing instances. Instead, use the create hw-crypto and scope hw-crypto CLI commands. For more information, see the Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Command Reference.
New FXOS CLI commands:
create hw-crypto
delete hw-crypto
scope hw-crypto
show hw-crypto
Removed FXOS CLI commands:
show hwCrypto (replaced by show hw-crypto )
config hwCrypto
Removed FTD CLI commands:

Cisco Firepower User Agent Version 2.5 integration
We released Version 2.5 of the Cisco Firepower User Agent, which you can integrate with Firepower Versions 6.4.0 through 6.6.x.
Note
  Version 6.6 is the last release to support the Cisco Firepower User Agent software as an identity source. You cannot upgrade an FMC with user agent configurations to Version 6.7+. You should switch to Cisco Identity Services Engine/Passive Identity Connector (ISE/ISE-PIC). This will also allow you to take advantage of features that are not available with the user agent. To convert your license, contact your Cisco representative or partner contact.
For more information, see the End-of-Life and End-of-Support for the Cisco Firepower User Agent announcement and the Firepower User Identity: Migrating from User Agent to Identity Services Engine TechNote.
New/modified FMC CLI commands: configure user-agent
Supported platforms: FMC
Event Logging and Analysis
Threat Intelligence Director priorities.
TID blocking/monitoring observable actions now have priority over blocking/monitoring with Security Intelligence Block lists.
If you configure the Block TID observable action, even if the traffic also matches a Security Intelligence Block list set to Block:
The Security Intelligence category in the connection event is a variant of TID Block.
The system generates a TID incident with an action taken of Blocked.
If you configure the Monitor TID observable action, even if the traffic also matches a Security Intelligence Block list set to Monitor:
The Security Intelligence category in the connection event is a variant of TID Monitor
The system generates a TID incident with an action taken of Monitored.
Previously, in each of these cases, the system reported the category by analysis and did not generate a TID incident.
Note
  The system still effectively handles traffic as before. Traffic that was blocked before is still blocked, and monitored traffic is still monitored. This simply changes which component gets the 'credit.' You may also see more TID incidents generated.
For complete information on system behavior when you enable both Security Intelligence and TID, see the TID-Firepower Management Center Action Prioritization information in the FMC configuration guide.
Supported platforms: FMC
'Packet profile' CLI commands
You can now use the FTD CLI to obtain statistics on how the device handled network traffic. That is, how many packets were fastpathed by a prefilter policy, offloaded as a large flow, fully evaluated by access control (Snort), and so on.
New FTD CLI commands:
asp packet-profile
no asp packet-profile
show asp packet-profile
clear asp packet-profile
Supported platforms: FTD
Additional event types for Cisco SecureX
Firepower can now send file and malware events to Cisco SecureX, as well as high priority connection events — those related to intrusion, file, malware, and Security Intelligence events.
Note that the FMC web interface refers to this offering as Cisco Threat Response (CTR).
New/modified pages: System > Integration > Cloud Services.
Supported platforms: FTD (via syslog or direct integration) and Classic (via syslog) devices
Administration and Troubleshooting
Precision Time Protocol (PTP) configuration for ISA 3000 devices.
You can use FlexConfig to configure the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) on ISA 3000 devices. PTP is a time-synchronization protocol developed to synchronize the clocks of various devices in a packet-based network. The protocol is designed specifically for industrial, networked measurement and control systems.
We now allow you to include the ptp (interface mode) command, and the global commands ptp mode e2etransparent and ptp domain , in FlexConfig objects.
New/modified commands: show ptp
Supported platforms: ISA 3000 with FTD
Configure more domains (multitenancy)
When implementing multitenancy (segment user access to managed devices, configurations, and events), you can create up to 100 subdomains under a top-level Global domain, in two or three levels. The previous maximum was 50 domains.
Supported platforms: FMC
ISE Connection Status Monitor enhancements
The ISE Connection Status Monitor health module now alerts you to issues with TrustSec SXP (SGT Exchange Protocol) subscription status.
Supported platforms: FMC
Regional clouds
Upgrade impact.
If you use the Cisco Threat Response integration, Cisco Support Diagnostics, or Cisco Success Network features, you can now select a regional cloud.
By default, the upgrade assigns you to the US (North America) region.
New/modified pages: System > Integration > Cloud Services
Supported platforms: FMC, FTD
Cisco Support Diagnostics
Upgrade impact.
Cisco Support Diagnostics (sometimes called Cisco Proactive Support) sends configuration and operational health data to Cisco, and processes that data through our automated problem detection system, allowing us to proactively notify you of issues. This feature also allows Cisco TAC to collect essential information from your devices during the course of a TAC case.
During initial setup and upgrades, you may be asked to enroll. You can also change your enrollment at any time.
In Version 6.5.0, Cisco Support Diagnostics support is limited to select platforms.
New/modified pages:
System > Smart Licenses
System > Smart Licenses > Register
Supported platforms: FMC, Firepower 4100/9300, FTDv for Azure
FMC model migration
You can now use the backup and restore feature to migrate configurations and events between FMCs, even if they are not the same model. This makes it easier to replace FMCs due to technical or business reasons such as a growing organization, migration from a physical to a virtual implementation, hardware refresh, and so on.
In general, you can migrate from a lower-end to a higher-end FMC, but not the reverse. Migration from KVM and Microsoft Azure is not supported. You must also unregister and reregister with Cisco Smart Software Manager (CSSM).
For details, including supported target and destination models, see the Firepower Management Center Model Migration Guide.
Supported platforms: FMC
Default HTTPS server certificates.
If you are upgrading from Version 6.4.0.9+, the default HTTPS server certificate's lifespan-on-renew returns to 3 years, but this is again updated to 800 days in Version 6.5.0.5+ and 6.6+.
Your current default HTTPS server certificate is set to expire depending on when it was generated, as follows:
6.4.0.9 and later patches: 800 days
6.4.0 to 6.4.0.8: 3 years
6.3.0 and all patches: 3 years
6.2.3: 20 years
Security and Hardening
Secure erase for appliance components on FXOS-based FTD devices
You can now use the FXOS CLI to securely erase a specified appliance component.
New FXOS CLI commands: erase secure
Supported platforms: Firepower 1000/2000 and Firepower 4100/9300
Stricter password requirements for FMC admin accounts during initial setup
FMC initial setup now requires that you choose a ‘strong’ password for admin accounts. The setup process applies this strong password to both the FMC web interface and CLI admin accounts.
Note
  Upgrading to Version 6.5.0+ does not force you to change weak passwords to strong passwords. With the exception of LOM users on physical FMCs (and this does include the admin user), you are not prohibited from choosing a new weak password. However, we do recommend that all Firepower user accounts — especially those with Admin access — have strong passwords.
Supported platforms: FMC
Concurrent user session limits
You can now limit the number of users that can be logged into the FMC at the same time. You can limit concurrent sessions for users with read only roles, read/write roles, or both. Note that CLI users are limited by the read/write setting.
New/modified pages: System > Configuration > User Configuration > Max Concurrent Sessions Allowed options
Supported platforms: FMC
Authenticated NTP servers
You can now configure secure communications between the FMC and NTP servers using SHA1 or MD5 symmetric key authentication. For system security, we recommend using this feature.
New/modified pages: System > Configuration > Time Synchronization
Supported platforms: FMC
Usability and Performance
Improved initial configuration experience
On new and reimaged FMCs, a wizard replaces the previous initial setup process. If you use the GUI wizard, when initial setup completes, the FMC displays the device management page so that you can immediately begin licensing and setting up your deployment.
The setup process also automatically schedules the following:
Software downloads. The system creates a weekly scheduled task to download (but not install) software patches and publicly available hotfixes that apply to your deployment.
FMC configuration-only backups. The system creates a weekly scheduled task to back up FMC configurations and store them locally.
GeoDB updates. The system enables weekly geolocation database updates.
These tasks are scheduled in UTC, which means that when they occur locally depends on the date and your specific location. Also, because tasks are scheduled in UTC, they do not adjust for Daylight Saving Time, summer time, or any such seasonal adjustments that you may observe in your location. If you are affected, scheduled tasks occur one hour "later" in the summer than in the winter, according to local time.
Note
  We strongly recommend you review the auto-scheduled tasks/GeoDB updates and adjust them if necessary.
Upgraded FMCs are not affected. For details on the initial configuration wizard, see the Getting Started Guide for your FMC model; for details on scheduled tasks, see the FMC configuration guide.
Supported platforms: FMC
Light theme
Beta.
The FMC web interface defaults to the Classic theme, but you can also choose a new Light theme.
Note
  The Light theme is a Beta feature. You may see misaligned text or other UI elements. In some cases, you may also experience slower-than-normal response times. If you encounter issues that prevent you from using a page or feature, switch back to the Classic theme. Although we cannot respond to everybody, we also welcome feedback — please use the feedback link on the User Preferences page or contact us at fmc-light-theme-feedback@cisco.com">.

Deprecated Features
Table 26. Deprecated Features in FMC Version 6.5 Patches
Feature
Description
Version 6.5.0.2
Deprecated: Egress optimization (temporary).
Upgrade impact.
Egress optimization is a performance feature targeted for selected IPS traffic. It is enabled by default on all FTD platforms, and the Version 6.5.0 upgrade process enables egress optimization on eligible devices. However, to mitigate CSCvq34340, patching FTD to Version 6.5.0.2+ turns off egress optimization processing. This happens regardless of whether the egress optimization feature is enabled or disabled.
Note
  We recommend you upgrade to Version 6.6+, where this issue is fixed. That will turn egress optimization back on, if you left the feature 'enabled.' If you remain at Version 6.5.0 or 6.5.0.1, you should manually disable egress optimization from the FTD CLI: no asp inspect-dp egress-optimization .
For more information, see the software advisory: FTD traffic outage due to 9344 block size depletion caused by the egress optimization feature.
Supported platforms: FTD
Table 27. Deprecated Features in Version 6.5.0
Feature
Description
End of support: FMC 750, 1500, 3500.
You cannot run Version 6.5+ on the FMC models FMC 1000, 2500, and 4500. You cannot manage Version 6.5+ devices with these FMCs.
End of support: ASA 5515-X and ASA 5585-X series
You cannot run Version 6.5+ on the ASA 5515-X and ASA 5585-X series devices (SSP-10, -20, -40, and -60).
End of support: Firepower 7000/8000 series.
You cannot run Version 6.5+ on Firepower 7000/8000 series devices, including AMP models.
Deprecated: Ability to disable the FMC CLI.
Version 6.3 introduced the FMC CLI, which you had to explicitly enable. In Version 6.5, the CLI is automatically enabled, for both new and upgraded deployments. If you want to access the Linux shell (also called expert mode), you must log in to the CLI and then use the expert command.
Caution
  We recommend you do not access Firepower appliances using the shell, unless directed by Cisco TAC.
Deprecated options: System > Configuration > Console Configuration > Enable CLI access check box
Deprecated: MD5 authentication algorithm and DES encryption for SNMPv3 users.
Version 6.5 deprecates the MD5 authentication algorithm and DES encryption for SNMPv3 users on FTD.
Although these configurations continue to work post-upgrade, the system displays a warning when you deploy. And, you cannot create new users or edit existing users with these options.
Support is removed in Version 7.0. If you are still using these options in your platform settings policy, we recommend you switch to stronger options now.
New/modified screens: Devices > Platform Settings > SNMP > Users
Deprecated: TLS 1.0 & 1.1.
Upgrade impact.
To enhance security:
Captive portal (active authentication) has removed support for TLS 1.0.
Host input has removed support for TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1.
If your client fails to connect with a Firepower appliance, we recommend you upgrade your client to support TLS 1.2.
Deprecated: TLS crypto acceleration FXOS CLI commands for Firepower 4100/9300.
As part of allowing TLS crypto acceleration for multiple container instances on Firepower 4100/9300, we removed the following FXOS CLI commands:
show hwCrypto
config hwCrypto
And this FTD CLI command:
show crypto accelerator status
For information on their replacements, see the new feature documentation.
Deprecated: Cisco Security Packet Analyzer integration.
Version 6.5 ends support for FMC integration with Cisco Security Packet Analyzer.
Deprecated screens/options:
System > Integration > Packet Analyzer
Analysis > Advanced > Packet Analyzer Queries
Query Packet Analyzer when right-clicking on an event in the dashboard or event viewer
Deprecated: Geolocation details.
In May 2022 we split the GeoDB into two packages: a country code package that maps IP addresses to countries/continents, and an IP package that contains additional contextual data associated with routable IP addresses. The contextual data in the IP package can include additional location details, as well as connection information such as ISP, connection type, proxy type, domain name, and so on.
The new country code package has the same file name as the old all-in-one package: Cisco_GEODB_Update-date-build. This allows deployments running Version 7.1 and earlier to continue to obtain GeoDB updates. If you manually download GeoDB updates—for example, in an air-gapped deployment—make sure you get the country code package and not the IP package.
Important
  This split does not affect geolocation rules or traffic handling in any way—those rules rely only on the data in the country code package. However, because the country code package essentially replaces the all-in-one package, the contextual data is no longer updated and will grow stale. To obtain fresh data, upgrade or reimage the FMC to Version 7.2+ and update the GeoDB.
New Features in FMC Version 6.4
New Features
Table 28. New Features in FMC Version 6.4 Patches
New Feature
Description
Version 6.4.0.10
Upgrades postpone scheduled tasks.
Upgrade impact.
Upgrades now postpone scheduled tasks. Any task scheduled to begin during the upgrade will begin five minutes after the post-upgrade reboot.
Note
  Before you begin any upgrade, you must still make sure running tasks are complete. Tasks running when the upgrade begins are stopped, become failed tasks, and cannot be resumed.
Note that this feature is supported for Firepower appliances running Version 6.4.0.10 or any later patch. It is not supported for upgrades to Version 6.4.0.10, or upgrades that skip Version 6.4.0.10. This feature is temporarily deprecated in Versions 6.5.0–6.6.1, but returns in Version 6.6.3.
Version 6.4.0.9
Default HTTPS server certificates.
Upgrade impact.
Upgrading an FMC or 7000/8000 series device from Version 6.4.0–6.4.0.8 to any later Version 6.4.0.x patch (or an FMC to Version 6.6.0+) renews the default HTTPS server certificate, which expires 800 days from the date of the upgrade. All future renewals have an 800 day lifespan.
Your old certificate was set to expire depending on when it was generated, as follows:
6.4.0 to 6.4.0.8: 3 years
6.3.0 and all patches: 3 years
6.2.3 and earlier: 20 years
Note that in Version 6.5.0–6.5.0.4, the lifespan-on-renew returns to 3 years, but this is again updated to 800 days with Version 6.5.0.5 and 6.6.0.
Version 6.4.0.4
New syslog fields.
These new syslog fields collectively identify a unique connection event:
Sensor UUID
First Packet Time
Connection Instance ID
Connection Counter
These fields also appear in syslogs for intrusion, file, and malware events, allowing connection events to be associated with those events.
Version 6.4.0.2
Detection of rule conflicts in FTD NAT policies.
Upgrade impact.
After you upgrade to Version 6.4.0.2 or later patch, you can no longer create FTD NAT policies with conflicting rules (often referred to as duplicate or overlapping rules). This fixes an issue where conflicting NAT rules were applied out-of-order.
If you currently have conflicting NAT rules, you will be able to deploy post-upgrade. However, your NAT rules will continue to be applied out-of-order.
Therefore, we recommend that after the upgrade, you inspect your FTD NAT policies by editing (no changes are needed) then attempting to resave. If you have rule conflicts, the system will prevent you from saving. Correct the issues, save, and then deploy.
Version 6.4.0.2
ISE Connection Status Monitor health module.
A new health module, the ISE Connection Status Monitor, monitors the status of the server connections between the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) and the FMC.

With FXOS 2.6.1, you can now deploy ASA and FTD logical devices on the same Firepower 9300.
Firepower Threat Defense: Device Management
FTDv for VMware defaults to vmxnet3 interfaces.
FTDv for VMware now defaults to vmxnet3 interfaces when you create a virtual device. Previously, the default was e1000. The vmxnet3 device drivers and network processing are integrated with the ESXi hypervisor, so they use fewer resources and offer better network performance.
Note
  Version 6.6 ends support for e1000 interfaces. You will not be able to upgrade to Version 6.6+ until you switch to vmxnet3 or ixgbe interfaces. We recommend you do this now. For more information, refer to the instructions on adding and configuring VMware interfaces in the Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Virtual Getting Started Guide.

TLS crypto acceleration.
Upgrade impact.
SSL hardware acceleration has been renamed TLS crypto acceleration. Depending on the device, TLS crypto acceleration might be performed in software or in hardware. The Version 6.4.0 upgrade process automatically enables acceleration on all eligible devices, even if you previously disabled the feature manually.
In most cases you cannot configure this feature; it is automatically enabled and you cannot disable it. However, if you are using the multi-instance capability of the Firepower 4100/9300 chassis, you can enable TLS crypto acceleration for one container instance per module/security engine. Acceleration is disabled for other container instances, but enabled for native instances.
New FXOS CLI commands for the Firepower 4100/9300 chassis:
show hwCrypto
config hwCrypto
New FTD CLI commands:
show crypto accelerator status (replaces system support ssl-hw-status )
Removed FTD CLI commands:
system support ssl-hw-accel

Cisco Security Analytics and Logging (SaaS) integration.
You can send Firepower events to the Stealthwatch Cloud for storage, and optionally make your Firepower event data available for security analytics using Stealthwatch Cloud.
Using Cisco Security Analytics and Logging (SaaS), also known as SAL (SaaS), your Firepower devices send events as syslog messages to a Security Events Connector (SEC) installed on a virtual machine on your network, and this SEC forwards the events to the Stealthwatch cloud for storage. You view and work with your events using the web-based Cisco Defense Orchestrator (CDO) portal. Depending on the license you purchase, you can also use the Stealthwatch portal to access that product's analytics features.

Security and Hardening
Signed SRU, VDB, and GeoDB updates.
So Firepower can verify that you are using the correct update files, Version 6.4.0+ uses signed updates for intrusion rules (SRU), the vulnerability database (VDB), and the geolocation database (GeoDB). Earlier versions continue to use unsigned updates. Unless you manually download updates from Cosco—for example, in an air-gapped deployment—you should not notice any difference in functionality.
If, however, you do manually download and install SRU, VDB, and GeoDB updates, make sure you download the correct package for your current version. Signed update files for Version 6.4.0+ begin with 'Cisco' instead of 'Sourcefire,' and terminate in .sh.REL.tar instead of .sh:
SRU: Cisco_Firepower_SRU-date-build-vrt.sh.REL.tar
VDB: Cisco_VDB_Fingerprint_Database-4.5.0-version.sh.REL.tar
GeoDB: Cisco_GEODB_Update-date-build.sh.REL.tar
Update files for Version 5.x through 6.3 still use the old naming scheme:
SRU: Sourcefire_Rule_Update-date-build-vrt.sh
VDB: Sourcefire_VDB_Fingerprint_Database-4.5.0-version.sh
GeoDB: Sourcefire_Geodb_Update-date-build.sh
We will provide both signed and unsigned updates until the end-of-support for versions that require unsigned updates. Do not untar signed (.tar) packages.
Note
  If you accidentally upload a signed update to an older FMC or ASA FirePOWER device, you must manually delete it. Leaving the package takes up disk space, and also may cause issues with future upgrades.
Supported platforms: Any

2048-bit certificate keys now required (security enhancement).
Upgrade impact.
When making secure connections to external data sources, such as AMP for Endpoints or Cisco Threat Intelligence Detector (TID), the FMC now requires that the server certificate be generated with keys that are at least 2048 bits long. Certificates previously generated with 1024-bit keys will no longer work.
Note that this security enhancement was introduced in Version 6.3.0.3. If you are upgrading from Version 6.1.0 through 6.3.0.2, you may be affected. If you cannot connect, regenerate the server certificate on your data source. If necessary, reconfigure the FMC connection to the data source.
Supported platforms: FMC
Usability and Performance
Snort restart improvements.
Before Version 6.4.0, during Snort restarts, the system dropped encrypted connections that matched a 'Do not decrypt' SSL rule or default policy action. Now, routed/transparent traffic passes without inspection instead of dropping, as long as you did not disable large flow offload or Snort preserve-connection.
Supported platforms: Firepower 4100/9300
Performance improvement for selected IPS traffic.
Upgrade impact.
Egress optimization is a performance feature targeted for selected IPS traffic. It is enabled by default on all FTD platforms, and the Version 6.4.0 upgrade process enables egress optimization on eligible devices.
New/modified commands:
asp inspect-dp egress optimization
show asp inspect-dp egress optimization
clear asp inspect-dp egress optimization
show conn state egress_optimization
For more information, see the Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Command Reference. To troubleshoot issues with egress optimization, contact Cisco TAC.
Note
  To mitigate CSCvq34340, patching FTD device to Version 6.4.0.7+ turns off egress optimization processing. This happens regardless of whether the egress optimization feature is enabled or disabled. We recommend you upgrade to Version 6.6+, where this issue is fixed. That will turn egress optimization back on, if you left the feature 'enabled.' If you remain at Version 6.4.0–6.4.0.6, you should manually disable egress optimization from the FTD CLI: no asp inspect-dp egress-optimization .
For more information, see the software advisory: FTD traffic outage due to 9344 block size depletion caused by the egress optimization feature.

Deprecated Features
Table 30. Deprecated Features in FMC Version 6.4.0
Deprecated Feature
Description
Deprecated: SSL hardware acceleration FTD CLI commands.
As part of the TLS crypto acceleration feature, we removed the following FTD CLI commands:
system support ssl-hw-accel enable
system support ssl-hw-accel disable
system support ssl-hw-status
Deprecated: Geolocation details.
In May 2022 we split the GeoDB into two packages: a country code package that maps IP addresses to countries/continents, and an IP package that contains additional contextual data associated with routable IP addresses. The contextual data in the IP package can include additional location details, as well as connection information such as ISP, connection type, proxy type, domain name, and so on.
The new country code package has the same file name as the old all-in-one package: Cisco_GEODB_Update-date-build. This allows deployments running Version 7.1 and earlier to continue to obtain GeoDB updates. If you manually download GeoDB updates—for example, in an air-gapped deployment—make sure you get the country code package and not the IP package.
Important
  This split does not affect geolocation rules or traffic handling in any way—those rules rely only on the data in the country code package. However, because the country code package essentially replaces the all-in-one package, the contextual data is no longer updated and will grow stale. To obtain fresh data, upgrade or reimage the FMC to Version 7.2+ and update the GeoDB.
New Features in FMC Version 6.3
New Features
Table 31. New Features in FMC Version 6.3 Patches
New Feature
Description
Version 6.3.0.4
Detection of rule conflicts in FTD NAT policies
Upgrade impact.
After you upgrade to Version 6.3.0.4 or later patch, you can no longer create FTD NAT policies with conflicting rules (often referred to as duplicate or overlapping rules). This fixes an issue where conflicting NAT rules were applied out-of-order.
If you currently have conflicting NAT rules, you will be able to deploy post-upgrade. However, your NAT rules will continue to be applied out-of-order.
Therefore, we recommend that after the upgrade, you inspect your FTD NAT policies by editing (no changes are needed) then attempting to resave. If you have rule conflicts, the system will prevent you from saving. Correct the issues, save, and then deploy.
Note that upgrading to Version 6.4.0 deprecates this fix. It is fixed again in Version 6.4.0.2.
Version 6.3.0.4
ISE Connection Status Monitor module
A new module, the ISE Connection Status Monitor, monitors the status of the server connections between the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) and the FMC.
Note that upgrading to Version 6.4.0 deprecates this module. Support returns in Version 6.4.0.2.
New/modified screens: System > > Policy > create or edit policy > ISE Connection Status Monitor
Version 6.3.0.3
2048-bit certificate keys now required (security enhancement)
When making secure connections to external data sources, such as AMP for Endpoints or Cisco Threat Intelligence Detector (TID), the FMC now requires that the server certificate be generated with keys that are at least 2048 bits long. Certificates previously generated with 1024-bit keys will no longer work.
If you cannot connect, regenerate the server certificate on your data source. If necessary, reconfigure the FMC connection to the data source.
Version 6.3.0.1
EMS extension support
Upgrade impact.
Version 6.3.0.1 reintroduces EMS extension support, which was introduced in Version 6.2.3.8/6.2.3.9 but was not included in Version 6.3.0.
Both the Decrypt-Resign and Decrypt-Known Key SSL policy actions again support the EMS extension during ClientHello negotiation, enabling more secure communications. The EMS extension is defined by RFC 7627.
In FMC deployments, this feature depends on the device version. Although best practice is to upgrade your whole deployment, this feature is supported even if you patch only the device.

Firepower Threat Defense: HA and Clustering
Multi-instance capability for Firepower 4100/9300.
You can now deploy multiple logical devices, each with a Firepower Threat Defense container instance, on a single security engine/module. Formerly, you could only deploy a single native application instance.
To provide flexible physical interface use, you can create VLAN subinterfaces in FXOS and also share interfaces between multiple instances. Resource management lets you customize performance capabilities for each instance.
You can use high availability using a container instance on 2 separate chassis. Clustering is not supported.
Note
  Multi-instance capability is similar to ASA multiple context mode, although the implementation is different. Multiple context mode is not available for FTD.

Cluster control link customizable IP Address for the Firepower 4100/9300
By default, the cluster control link uses the 127.2.0.0/16 network. You can now set the network when you deploy the cluster in FXOS. The chassis auto-generates the cluster control link interface IP address for each unit based on the chassis ID and slot ID: 127.2.chassis_id.slot_id. However, some networking deployments do not allow 127.2.0.0/16 traffic to pass. Therefore, you can now set a custom /16 subnet for the cluster control link in FXOS except for loopback (127.0.0.0/8) and multicast (224.0.0.0/4) addresses.

Improved FTD cluster addition to the FMC
You can now add any unit of a cluster to the FMC, and the other cluster units are detected automatically. Formerly, you had to add each cluster unit as a separate device, and then group them into a cluster with the FMC. Adding a cluster unit is also now automatic. Note that you must delete a unit manually.

Firepower Threat Defense: Encryption and VPN
SSL hardware acceleration
Additional FTD devices now support SSL hardware acceleration. Also, this option is now enabled by default.
Upgrading to Version 6.3.0 automatically enables SSL hardware acceleration on eligible devices. Using SSL hardware acceleration if you are not decrypting traffic can affect performance. We recommend you disable SSL hardware acceleration on devices that are not decrypting traffic.
Supported platforms: Firepower 2100 series, Firepower 4100/9300
RA VPN: RADIUS Dynamic Authorization or Change of Authorization (CoA)
You can now use RADIUS servers for user authorization of RA VPN using dynamic access control lists (ACLs) or ACL names per user.
Supported platforms: FTD
RA VPN: Two-Factor Authentication
Firepower Threat Defense now supports two-factor authentication for RA VPN users using the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client. For the two-factor authentication process, we support:
First factor: any RADIUS or LDAP/AD server
Second factor: RSA tokens or DUO passcodes pushed to mobile
For more information on Duo multi-factor authentication (MFA) for FTD, see the Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) VPN with AnyConnect documentation on the Duo Security website.
Supported platforms: FTD
Security Policies
Firepower Threat Defense service policy
You can now configure a Firepower Threat Defense service policy as part of your access control policy advanced options. Use FTD service policies to apply services to specific traffic classes.
Features supported include:
TCP State Bypass
Randomizing TCP sequence numbers
Decrementing the time-to-live (TTL) value on packets
Dead Connection Detection
Setting a limit on the maximum number of connections and embryonic connections per traffic class and per client.
Timeouts for embryonic, half closed, and idle connections
Note
  Before Version 6.3.0, you could configure connection-related service rules using the TCP_Embryonic_Conn_Limit and TCP_Embryonic_Conn_Timeout predefined FlexConfig objects. You should remove those objects and redo your rules in the FTD service policy. If you created any custom FlexConfig objects to implement any of these connection-related features (that is, set connection commands), you should also remove those objects and implement the features through the FTD service policy. Failure to do so can cause deployment issues.
The Threat Defense Service Policies chapter in the FMC configuration guide has details on how service policies relate to FlexConfig and other features.
New/modified pages: Policies > Access Control > edit/create policy > Advanced tab > Threat Defense Service Policy
Supported platforms: FTD
Update interval for URL category and reputation data
Upgrade impact.
You can now force URL data to expire. There is a tradeoff between security and performance. A shorter interval means you use more current data, while a longer interval can make web browsing faster for your users.
If you worked with Cisco TAC to specify a timeout value for the URL filtering cache, the upgrade may change that value. Otherwise, the setting defaults to disabled (the current behavior), meaning that cached URL data does not expire.

Unified syslog configuration
Upgrade impact.
Version 6.3.0 changes and centralizes the way the system logs connection and intrusion events via syslog.
Previously, you configured event logging via syslog in multiple places, depending on the event type. You now configure syslog messaging in the access control policy. These configurations affect connection and intrusion event logging for the access control, SSL, prefilter, and intrusion policies, as well as for Security Intelligence.
The upgrade does not change your existing settings for connection event logging. However, you may suddenly start receiving intrusion events you did not "expect" via syslog. This is because the intrusion policy now sends syslog events to the destination specified in the access control policy. (Before, you could configure syslog alerting in an intrusion policy to send events to the syslog on the managed device itself rather than to an external host.)
For FTD devices, some syslog platform settings now apply to connection and intrusion event messages. For a list, see the Platform Settings for Firepower Threat Defense chapter in the FMC configuration guide.
For NGIPS devices (7000/8000 series, ASA FirePOWER, NGIPSv), messages now use the ISO 8601 timestamp format as specified in RFC 5425.
Supported platforms: Any
Fully qualified syslog messages for connection and intrusion events
The format of syslog messages for connection, security intelligence, and intrusion events have the following changes:
Messages from FTD devices now include event type identification numbers.
Fields with empty or unknown values are no longer included, so messages are shorter and important data is less likely to be truncated.
Timestamps now use the ISO 8601 timestamp format as specified in the RFC 5425 syslog format (optional for FTD, required for Classic).
Supported platforms: Any
Other syslog improvements for FTD devices
You can send all syslog messages from the same interface (data or management), using the same IP address, using TCP or UDP protocol. Note that secure syslog is supported on data ports only. You can also use the RFC 5424 format for message timestamps.

Security and Hardening
HTTPS Certificates
The default HTTPS server certificate provided with the system now expires in three years.
If your appliance uses a default server certificate that was generated before you upgraded to Version 6.3.0, the server certificate will expire 20 years from when it was first generated. If you are using the default HTTPS server certificate the system now provides the ability to renew it.
New/modified pages: System > Configuration > HTTPS Certificate > Renew HTTPS Certificate button
New/modified Classic CLI commands: show http-cert-expire-date , system renew-http-certnew_key
Supported platforms: Physical FMCs, 7000/8000 series devices
Improved login security
Upgrade impact.
Added FMC user configuration settings to improve login security:
Track Successful Logins: Track the number of successful logins each FMC account has performed within a specific time period.
Password Reuse Limit: Track an FMC user's password history to prevent reuse.
Max Number of Login Failures and Set Time in Minutes to Temporarily Lockout Users: Limit the number of times in a row an FMC user can enter incorrect web interface login credentials before being temporarily blocked.
We also updated the list of supported ciphers and cryptographic algorithms for secure SSH access. If your SSH client fails to connect with a Firepower appliance due to a cipher error, update your client to the latest version.
New/modified pages: System > Configuration > User Configuration
Supported platforms: FMC
Limit SSH login failures on devices
When a user accesses any device via SSH and fails three successive login attempts, the device terminates the SSH session.
Supported platforms: Any device
Usability and Performance
How-to walkthroughs
FMC walkthroughs (also called how-tos) guide you through a variety of basic tasks such as device setup and policy configuration. Just click How To at the bottom of the browser window, choose a walkthrough, and follow the step-by-step instructions. To end a walkthrough at any time, click the x in the upper right corner.
Note
  FMC walkthroughs are tested on the Firefox and Chrome browsers. If you encounter issues with a different browser, we ask that you switch to Firefox or Chrome. If you continue to encounter issues, contact Cisco TAC.
The following are some common problems and solutions:
Problem: Cannot find the link to start walkthroughs.
Solution: Make sure walkthroughs are enabled. From the drop-down list under your username, select User Preferences then click How-To Settings.
Problem: Walkthrough appears when you do not expect it.
Solution: End the walkthrough.
Problem: Walkthrough disappears or quits suddenly.
Solution: Move your pointer, or navigate to a different page and try again.
Problem: Walkthrough is out of sync with the FMC (starts on the wrong step, advances prematurely, will not advance).
Solution: Attempt to continue. For example, if you enter an invalid value in a field and the FMC displays an error, the walkthrough can prematurely move on. You may need to go back and resolve the error to complete the task. However, sometimes you cannot continue. For example, if you do not click Next after you complete a step, you may need to end the walkthrough, navigate to a different page, and try again.
Firepower Management Center REST API
New REST API services
Added REST API services to support these features:
Site-to-site VPN topology: ftds2svpns, endpoints, ipsecsettings, advancedsettings, ikesettings, ikev1ipsecproposals, ikev1policies, ikev2ipsecproposals, ikev2policies
HA device failover: failoverinterfacemacaddressconfigs, monitoredinterfaces
Supported platforms: FMC
Bulk overrides
You can now perform bulk overrides on specific objects. For a full list, see the Cisco Firepower Management Center REST API Quick Start Guide.
Deprecated Features
Table 33. Deprecated Features in Version 6.3.0
Deprecated Feature
Description
End of support: VMware vSphere/VMware ESXi 5.5.
Version 6.3 discontinues support for virtual deployments on VMware vSphere/VMware ESXi 6.0. Upgrade the hosting environment to a supported version before you upgrade the Firepower software.
End of support: ASA 5512-X and 5506-X series.
You cannot run Version 6.3+ on the ASA 5506-X, 5506H-X, 5506W-X, and 5512-X.
Deprecated: EMS extension support for decryption (temporary).
Upgrade impact.
Version 6.3.0 temporarily discontinues EMS extension support, which was introduced in Version 6.2.3.8/6.2.3.9. This means that the Decrypt-Resign and Decrypt-Known Key SSL policy actions no longer support the EMS extension during ClientHello negotiation, which would enable more secure communications. The EMS extension is defined by RFC 7627.
In FMC deployments, this feature depends on the device version. Upgrading the FMC to Version 6.3.0 does not discontinue support, as long as the device is running a supported version. However, upgrading the device to Version 6.3.0 does discontinue support.
Support is reintroduced in Version 6.3.0.1.
Deprecated: Decryption on passive and inline tap interfaces.
Upgrade impact.
Version 6.3 ends support for decrypting traffic on interfaces in passive or inline tap mode, even though the GUI allows you to configure it. Any inspection of encrypted traffic is necessarily limited.
Deprecated: Default DNS group with FlexConfig.
Version 6.3 deprecates this FlexConfig object for FTD with FMC:
Default_DNS_Configure
And these associated text objects:
defaultDNSNameServerList
defaultDNSParameters
These allowed you to configure the Default DNS group, which defines the DNS servers that can be used when resolving fully qualified domain names on the data interfaces. This allowed you to use commands in the CLI, such as ping , using host names rather than IP addresses.
You can now configure DNS for the data interfaces in the FTD platform settings policy: Devices > Platform Settings > create or edit FTD policy > DNS.
Deprecated: Embryonic connection limit and timeout with FlexConfig.
Can cause post-upgrade deployment issues.
Version 6.3 deprecates these FlexConfig objects for FTD with FMC:
TCP_Embryonic_Conn_Limit
TCP_Embryonic_Conn_Timeout
And these associated text objects:
tcp_conn_misc
tcp_conn_limit
tcp_conn_timeout
These allowed you to configure embryonic connection limits and timeouts to protect against SYN Flood Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
You can now configure these features in the FTD service policy: Policies > Access Control > add/edit policy > Advanced tab > Threat Defense Service Policy.
Caution
  If you used set connection commands to implement connection-related service rules, you should remove the associated objects and implement the features through the FTD service policy. Failure to do so can cause deployment issues.
Deprecated: Geolocation details.
In May 2022 we split the GeoDB into two packages: a country code package that maps IP addresses to countries/continents, and an IP package that contains additional contextual data associated with routable IP addresses. The contextual data in the IP package can include additional location details, as well as connection information such as ISP, connection type, proxy type, domain name, and so on.
The new country code package has the same file name as the old all-in-one package: Cisco_GEODB_Update-date-build. This allows deployments running Version 7.1 and earlier to continue to obtain GeoDB updates. If you manually download GeoDB updates—for example, in an air-gapped deployment—make sure you get the country code package and not the IP package.
Important
  This split does not affect geolocation rules or traffic handling in any way—those rules rely only on the data in the country code package. However, because the country code package essentially replaces the all-in-one package, the contextual data is no longer updated and will grow stale. To obtain fresh data, upgrade or reimage the FMC to Version 7.2+ and update the GeoDB.
New Features in FMC Version 6.2.3
Table 34. New Features in FMC Version 6.2.3 Patches
New Feature
Description
Version 6.2.3.13
Detection of rule conflicts in FTD NAT policies
After you upgrade to Version 6.2.3.13+, you can no longer create FTD NAT policies with conflicting rules (often referred to as duplicate or overlapping rules). This fixes an issue where conflicting NAT rules were applied out-of-order.
If you currently have conflicting NAT rules, you will be able to deploy post-upgrade. However, your NAT rules will continue to be applied out-of-order.
Therefore, we recommend that after the upgrade, you inspect your FTD NAT policies by editing (no changes are needed) then attempting to resave. If you have rule conflicts, the system will prevent you from saving. Correct the issues, save, and then deploy.
Note
  Upgrading to Version 6.3.0 or 6.4.0 deprecates this fix. The issue is addressed in Version 6.3.0.4 and 6.4.0.2.
Supported platforms: FTD
Version 6.2.3.8
EMS extension support
Both the Decrypt-Resign and Decrypt-Known Key SSL policy actions now support the EMS extension during ClientHello negotiation, enabling more secure communications. The EMS extension is defined by RFC 7627.
Note
  Version 6.2.3.8 was removed from the Cisco Support & Download site on 2019-01-07. Upgrading to Version 6.2.3.9 also enables EMS extension support. Version 6.3.0 discontinues EMS extension support. In FMC deployments, this feature depends on the device version. Upgrading the FMC to Version 6.3.0 does not discontinue support, but upgrading the device does. Support is reintroduced in Version 6.3.0.1.
Supported platforms: Any
Version 6.2.3.7
TLS v1.3 downgrade CLI command for FTD
A new CLI command allows you to specify when to downgrade TLS v1.3 connections to TLS v1.2.
Many browsers use TLS v1.3 by default. If you are using an SSL policy to handle encrypted traffic, and people in your monitored network use browsers with TLS v1.3 enabled, websites that support TLS v1.3 fail to load.
For more information, see the system support commands in the Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Command Reference. We recommend you use these commands only after consulting with Cisco TAC.
Supported platforms: FTD
Version 6.2.3.3
Site-to-site VPN with clustering
You can now configure site-to-site VPN with clustering. Site-to-site VPN is a centralized feature; only the control unit supports VPN connections.
Supported platforms: Firepower 4100/9300
Table 35. New Features in FMC Version 6.2.3
New Feature
Description
Platform
FTD on the ISA 3000.
You can now run FTD on the ISA 3000 series.
Note that the ISA 3000 supports the Threat license only. It does not support the URL Filtering or Malware licenses. Thus, you cannot configure features that require the URL Filtering or Malware licenses on an ISA 3000. Special features for the ISA 3000 that were supported with the ASA, such as Hardware Bypass, Alarm ports, and so on, are not supported with FTD in this release.
Support for VMware ESXi 6.5.
You can now deploy FMCv, FTDv, and NGIPSv virtual appliances on VMware vSphere/VMware ESXi 6.5.
Firepower Threat Defense: Encryption and VPN
SSL hardware acceleration for Firepower 4100/9300
Firepower 4100/9300 with FTD now support SSL encryption and decryption acceleration in hardware, greatly improving performance. SSL hardware acceleration is disabled by default for all appliances that support it.
Note
  This feature is renamed TLS crypto acceleration in Version 6.4.0+.
Supported platforms: Firepower 4100/9300
Certificate enrollment improvements
Non-blocking work flow for certificate enrollment operation allows certificate enrollment on multiple FTD devices in parallel:
The administrator can now choose to have the Remote Access VPN Policy wizard enroll certificates for all devices in the policy by checking Enroll the selected certificate object on the target devices check box in the Access & Certificate step. If this is chosen, only deployment needs to be done after the wizard finishes. This is selected by default.
Administrators no longer have to initiate Remote Access VPN certificate enrollment on devices one at a time. The enrollment process for each device is now independent and can be done in parallel.
In the event of a PKS12 certificate enrollment failure, the administrator no longer needs to re-upload the PKS12 file again to retry enrollment, since it is now stored in the certificate enrollment object.
Supported platforms: FTD
Firepower Threat Defense: High Availability and Clustering
Automatically rejoin the FTD cluster after an internal failure
Formerly, many internal error conditions caused a cluster unit to be removed from the cluster, and you were required to manually rejoin the cluster after resolving the issue. Now, a unit will attempt to rejoin the cluster automatically at the following intervals: 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and then 20 minutes. Internal failures include: application sync timeout; inconsistent application statuses; and so on.
New/modified command: show cluster info auto-join
Supported platforms: Firepower 4100/9300
FTD High Availability Hardening
Version 6.2.3 introduces the following features for FTD devices in high availability:
Whenever active or standby FTD devices in a high availability pair restart, the FMC may not display accurate high availability status for either managed device. However, the status may not upgrade on the FMC because the communication between the device and the FMC is not established yet. The Refresh Node Status option on the Devices > Device Management page allows you to refresh the high availability node status to obtain accurate information about the active and standby device in a high availability pair.
The Devices > Device Management page of the FMC UI has a new Switch Active Peer icon.
Version 6.2.3 includes a new REST API object, Device High Availability Pair Services, that contains four functions:
DELETE ftddevicehapairs
PUT ftddevicehapairs
POST ftddevicehapairs
GET ftddevicehapairs
Administration and Troubleshooting
FMC High Availability Messaging
FMC high availability pairs have improved UI messaging. The UI now displays interim status messages while FMC pairs are being established and rephrased UI messaging to be more intuitive.
Supported platforms: FMC
External Authentication added for FTD SSH Access
You can now configure external authentication for SSH access to FTD devices using LDAP or RADIUS.
New/modified screen: Devices > Platform Settings > External Authentication
Supported platforms: FTD
Enhanced Vulnerability Database (VDB) Installation
The FMC now warns you before you install a VDB that installing restarts the Snort process, interrupting traffic inspection and, depending on how the managed device handles traffic, possibly interrupting traffic flow. You can cancel the install until a more convenient time, such as during a maintenance window.
These warnings can appear:
After you download and manually install a VDB.
When you create a scheduled task to install the VDB.
When the VDB installs in the background, such as during a previously scheduled task or as part of a Firepower software upgrade.
Supported platforms: FMC
Upgrade Package Push
You can now copy (or push) an upgrade package from the FMC to a managed device before you run the actual upgrade. This is useful because you can push during times of low bandwidth use, outside of the upgrade maintenance window.
When you push to high availability, clustered, or stacked devices, the system sends the upgrade package to the active/control/primary first, then to the standby/data/secondary.
New/modified screens: System > Updates
Supported platforms: FMC
FTD serviceability
Version 6.2.3 improves the show fail over CLI command. The new keyword, -history, details to help troubleshooting.
Show fail over history displays failure reason along with its specific details.
Show fail over history details displays fail over history from the peer unit.
Note
  This command includes fail over state changes and the reason for the state change for the peer unit.
Supported platforms: FTD
Device list sorting
On the Devices > Devices Management page, you can use the View by drop-down list to sort and view the device list by any of the following categories: group, license, model, or access control policy. In a multidomain deployment, you can also sort and view by domain, which is the default display category in that deployment. Devices must belong to a leaf domain.
Supported platforms: FMC
Audit log improvements
The audit log now denotes if a policy changed on the FTD Platform Settings Devices > Platform Settings page.
Supported platforms: FMC with FTD
Updated FTD CLI commands
The asa_mgmt_plane and asa_dataplane options for FTD device CLI commands are renamed to management-plane and data-plane respectively.
Supported platforms: FTD
Cisco Success Network
Upgrade impact.
Cisco Success Network sends usage information and statistics to Cisco, which are essential to provide you with technical support.
During initial setup and upgrades, you may be asked to enroll. You can also change your enrollment at any time.
Supported platforms: FMC
Web Analytics Tracking
Upgrade impact.
Web analytics provides non-personally-identifiable usage data to Cisco, including but not limited to page interactions, browser versions, product versions, user location, and management IP addresses or hostnames of your management centers.
Initial setup enrolls you in web analytics tracking by default, but you can change your enrollment at any time after that. Upgrades can also enroll or re-enroll you in web analytics tracking.
Supported platforms: FMC
Performance
Snort restarts reduced for FTD devices
In Version 6.2.3, fewer FTD configuration changes restart the Snort process on FTD devices.
The FMC now warns you before you deploy if the configuration deployment restarts the Snort process, interrupting traffic inspection and, depending on how the managed device handles traffic, possibly interrupting traffic flow.
Supported platforms: FTD
Traffic Drop on Policy Apply
Version 6.2.3 adds the configure snort preserve-connection {enable | disable} command to the FTD CLI. This command determines whether to preserve existing connections on routed and transparent interfaces if the Snort process goes down. When disabled, all new or existing connections are dropped when Snort goes down and remain dropped until Snort resume. When enabled, connections that were already allowed remain established, but new connections cannot be established until Snort is again available.
Note that you cannot permanently disable this command on a FTD device managed by FDM; existing connections may drop when the settings revert to default during the next configuration deployment.
Increased memory capacity for lower-end appliances
Versions 6.1.0.7, 6.2.0.5, 6.2.2.2, and 6.2.3 increase the memory capacity for lower-end Firepower appliances. This reduces the number of health alerts.
Faster ISE pxGrid discovery
If an ISE pxGrid deployed in high availability fails or becomes unreachable, the FMC now discovers the new active pxGrid faster.
New result limits in reports.
Upgrade can change report settings.
Version 6.2.3 limits the number of results you can use or include in a report section. For table and detail views, you can include fewer records in a PDF report than in an HTML/CSV report.
For HTML/CSV report sections, the new limits are:
Bar and pie charts: 100 (top or bottom)
Table views: 400,000
Detail views: 1,000
For PDF report sections, the new limits are:
Bar and pie charts: 100 (top or bottom)
Table views: 100,000
Detail views: 500
If, before you upgrade the FMC, a section in a report template specifies a larger number of results than the HTML/CSV maximum, the upgrade process lowers the setting to the new maximum value.
For report templates that generate PDF reports, if you exceed the PDF limit in any template section, the upgrade process changes the output format to HTML. To continue generating PDFs, lower the results limit to the PDF maximum. If you do this after the upgrade, set the output format back to PDF.
Firepower Management Center REST API
FMC REST API Improvements
The new FMC REST APIs support the use of CRUD (create, retrieve, upgrade, and delete) operations for NAT rules, static routing configuration, and corresponding objects while migrating from ASA FirePOWER to FTD.
Newly introduced APIs for NAT:
NAT rules
FTD NAT policies
Auto NAT rules
Manual NAT rules
When deploying FTD devices in Cisco ACI, APIs enable APIC controller to add proper static routes in place, along with other configuration settings that are needed for a particular service graph. It also enables PBR service graph insertion, which is currently the most flexible way of inserting FTD in ACI.
Newly introduced APIs for Static Route:
IPv4 static routes
IPv6 static routes
SLA monitors
Deprecated Features
Table 36. Deprecated Features in FMC Version 6.2.3
Deprecated Feature
Description
Expired CA certificates for dynamic analysis with AMP for Networks.
On June 15, 2018, some Firepower deployments stopped being able to submit files for dynamic analysis. This occurred due to an expired CA certificate that was required for communications with the AMP Threat Grid cloud. Version 6.3 is the first major version with the new certificate.
If you do not want to upgrade to Version 6.3+, you can patch to obtain the new certificate and reenable dynamic analysis, as follows:
Version 6.2.3 → patch to Version 6.2.3.4
Version 6.2.2 → patch to Version 6.2.2.4
Version 6.2.1 → no patches available
Version 6.2 → patch to Version 6.2.0.6
Version 6.1 → patch to Version 6.1.0.7
Version 6.0 → no patches available
You can also apply a hotfix. For available hotfixes, see the Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense/Firepower Hotfix Release Notes. Find the hotfix for your version and platform that applies to CSCvj07038: Firepower devices need to trust Threat Grid certificate.
If this is your first time installing the patch or hotfix, make sure your firewall allows outbound connections to fmc.api.threatgrid.com (replacing panacea.threatgrid.com) from both the FMC and its managed devices.
Note that upgrading a patched or hotfixed deployment to either Version 6.2.0 or Version 6.2.3 reverts to the old certificate and you must patch or hotfix again.
Deprecated: Geolocation details.
In May 2022 we split the GeoDB into two packages: a country code package that maps IP addresses to countries/continents, and an IP package that contains additional contextual data associated with routable IP addresses. The contextual data in the IP package can include additional location details, as well as connection information such as ISP, connection type, proxy type, domain name, and so on.
The new country code package has the same file name as the old all-in-one package: Cisco_GEODB_Update-date-build. This allows deployments running Version 7.1 and earlier to continue to obtain GeoDB updates. If you manually download GeoDB updates—for example, in an air-gapped deployment—make sure you get the country code package and not the IP package.
Important
  This split does not affect geolocation rules or traffic handling in any way—those rules rely only on the data in the country code package. However, because the country code package essentially replaces the all-in-one package, the contextual data is no longer updated and will grow stale. To obtain fresh data, upgrade or reimage the FMC to Version 7.2+ and update the GeoDB.
