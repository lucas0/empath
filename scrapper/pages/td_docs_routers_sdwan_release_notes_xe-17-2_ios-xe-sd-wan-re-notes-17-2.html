What's New for Cisco IOS XE Release 17
This section applies to Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
Cisco is constantly enhancing the SD-WAN solution with every release and we try and keep the content in line with the latest enhancements. The following table lists new and modified features we documented in the Configuration, Command Reference, and Hardware Installation guides. For information on additional features and fixes that were committed to the SD-WAN solution, see the Resolved and Open Bugs section in the Release Notes.
Table 1. Cisco IOS XE Release Amsterdam 17.2.1r
Feature Description
Cisco SD-WAN Getting Started
Install and Upgrade
This feature supports the use of a single "universalk9" image to deploy Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN and Cisco IOS XE functionality on all the supported devices. This universalk9 image supports two modes - Autonomous mode (for Cisco IOS XE features) and Controller mode (for Cisco SD-WAN features) .
Systems and Interfaces
Configure Global Parameters
This feature lets you configure HTTP and Telnet server settings, and several other device settings, from Cisco vManage.
CLI Add-On Feature Templates
This feature adds a new feature template called the CLI add-on feature template. You can use this feature template to attach specific CLI configurations to a device. If a configuration cannot be specified using Cisco vManage but can be configured using the CLI on the device, then you can use this feature template to specify such configurations. You can also use CLI add-on feature templates to add small pieces of CLI configuration, instead of an entire running configuration. This feature is not intended to replace existing feature templates but instead to enhance their functionality. Note that not all CLIs are supported. For more information, see Supported and Qualified CLIs for CLI Add-On Feature Templates.
Ability to Send Syslog Messages over TLS
This feature allows you to transport syslog messages to external configured hosts by establishing a Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection. Using the TLS protocol enables the content of syslog messages to remain confidential, secure, and untampered or unaltered during each hop.
802.1X Support for SD-WAN
This feature lets you enable the IEEE 802.1X authentication on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. To be able to configure this feature using Cisco vManage, ensure that Cisco vManage is running Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.1.1.
Default Device Templates
A default device template provides basic information that you can use to bring up devices in a deployment quickly. This feature is supported on the Cisco Cloud Services Router 1000V Series, Cisco C1111-8PLTELA Integrated Services Routers, and Cisco 4331 Integrated Services Routers.
Integration with Cisco Unified Communications
This feature lets you use feature templates and voice policies to enable Cisco Unified Communications (UC) voice services for supported routers. When Cisco UC voice services are enabled, routers can process calls for various endpoints, including voice ports, POTS dial peers, SIP dial peers, and phone profiles in SRST mode. Configuring UC voice services for Cisco Unified Communications requires that Cisco vManage be running Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.1.1. This feature is supported on Cisco 4000 Series Integrated Services Routers.
Support for NAT Pool, Static NAT, and NAT as a Loopback Interface
This feature supports NAT configuration for loopback interface addresses, NAT Pool support for DIA, and Static NAT on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
Support for Configuring Secondary IP Address
You can configure up to four secondary IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, and up to four DHCP helpers. Secondary IP addresses can be useful for forcing unequal load sharing between different interfaces, for increasing the number of IP addresses in a LAN when no more IPs are available from the subnet, and for resolving issues with discontinuous subnets and classful routing protocol.
Low-bandwidth Link Optimization
This feature extends the low-bandwidth-link option to Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices, when configuring an interface that allows tunneling. This option reduces control plane traffic and is intended for use primarily on cellular WAN links, where bandwidth limitations and charges for traffic use require minimizing bandwidth.
VRF Configuration
Support for VRF configuration increased from a total of 100 to a total of 300 VRFs. Supported on: Cisco ASR 1001-HX and Cisco ASR 1002-HX
Device Configuration CLI Templates
The CLI Templates feature has been updated to support device configuration-based CLIs. You can use these templates to push the device configuration (yang-cli) to devices directly.
Routing
MPLS-BGP Support on the Service Side
This features allows you to enable support on Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS). Multiple Service VPNs use inter autonomous system (AS) BGP labelled path to forward the traffic, which in turn helps scaling the service side VPNs with less control plane signaling. Label distribution for a given VPN routing and forwarding (VRF) instance on a given device can be handled by Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
Mapping Multiple BGP Communities to OMP Tags
This features allows you to display information about OMP routes on Cisco vSmart Controller and Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. OMP routes carry information that the device learns from the routing protocols running on its local network, including routes learned from BGP and OSPF, as well as direct, connected, and static routes.
Support for Multicast Overlay Routing Protocols
This feature enables efficient distribution of one-to-many traffic. The multicast routing protocols like, IPv4 Multicast, IGMPv3, PIM SSM, PIM ASM, Auto RP and Static RP distribute data (for example, audio/video streaming broadcasts) to multiple recipients. Using multicast overlay protocols, a source can send a single packet of data to a single multicast address, which is then distributed to an entire group of recipients.
Bridging
Support for Configuring Secondary IP Address
You can configure up to four secondary IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, and up to four DHCP helpers. Secondary IP addresses can be useful for forcing unequal load sharing between different interfaces, for increasing the number of IP addresses in a LAN when no more IPs are available from the subnet, and for resolving issues with discontinuous subnets and classful routing protocol.
Forwarding and QoS
Per-Tunnel QoS
This feature lets you apply a Quality of Service (QoS) policy on individual tunnels, ensuring that branch offices with smaller throughput are not overwhelmed by larger aggregation sites. This feature is only supported for hub-to-spoke network topologies.
Policies
Device Access Policy on SNMP and SSH
This feature defines the rules that traffic must meet to pass through an interface. When you define rules for incoming traffic, they are applied to the traffic before any other policies are applied. The control plane of Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device processes the data traffic for local services (like SSH and SNMP) from a set of sources in a VPN. Routing packets are required to form the overlay.
Path Preference Support for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices
This feature extends to Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices, support for selecting one or more local transport locators (TLOCs) for a policy action.
Support for upto Eight SLA Classes
This feature allows you to configure upto a maximum of eight SLA classes. In previous releases, you could only configure upto four SLA classes. This allows for additional options to be configured in an application-aware routing policy.
Security
SHA256 Support for IPSec Tunnels
This feature adds support for HMAC_SHA256 algorithms for enhanced security.
Firewall FQDN Support
This enhancement adds support to define a firewall policy using fully qualified domain names (FQDN), rather than only IP addresses. One advantage of using FQDNs is that they account for changes in the IP addresses assigned to the FQDN if that changes in the future.
SSL/TLS Proxy
The SSL/TLS Proxy feature allows you to configure an edge device as a transparent SSL/TLS proxy. Such proxy devices can then decrypt incoming and outgoing TLS traffic to enable their inspection by Unified Thread Defense (UTD) and identify risks that are hidden by end-to-end encryption. This feature is part of the Cisco SD-WAN Application Quality of Experience (AppQoE) and UTD solutions.
Auto-registration for Cisco Umbrella Cloud Services
This feature adds the ability to register devices to Cisco Umbrella using the Smart Account credentials to automatically retrieve Umbrella credentials (organization ID, registration key, and secret). This offers a more automatic alternative to manually copying a registration token from Umbrella.
Support for Automatic Tunneling to Secure Internet Gateways
This feature allows you to integrate your routers with a Secure Internet Gateway to perform security processing and ensure that your device's performance is not affected by processing security rules.
Manual Configuration for GRE Tunnels and IPsec Tunnels
This feature lets you manually configure a GRE tunnel by using the Cisco VPN Interface GRE template or an IPSec tunnel by using the Cisco VPN Interface IPSec template. For example, use this feature to manually configure a tunnel to a SIG.
Network Optimization and High Availability
Cloud onRamp for SaaS, Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices
Cloud onRamp for SaaS is available for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices, with a configuration workflow that is entirely different from the workflow that applies to Cisco vEdge devices. This feature is released as a fully functional beta in Cisco IOS XE Release Amsterdam 17.2.1r. The provisioning workflow is subject to change in future releases.
Monitor Cluster Activation Progress
This feature displays the cluster activation progress at each step and shows any failures that may occur during the process. The process of activating a cluster takes approximately 30 minutes or longer, and you can monitor the progress using the vManage task view window and events from the Monitoring page.
QoS on Service Chains
This feature classifies the network traffic based on the Layer 2 virtual local-area network (VLAN) identification number. The QoS policy allows you to limit the bandwidth available for each service chain by applying traffic policing on bidirectional traffic. The bidirectional traffic is the ingress side that connects Catalyst 9500-40X switches to the consumer and egress side that connects to the provider.
VNF States and Color Codes
This feature allows you to determine the state of a deployed VM using color codes, which you can view on the Monitor > Network page. These color codes help you make decisions on creating service chains based on the state of the VM.
Network Utilization Charts for SR-IOV Enabled NICs and OVS Switch
This feature allows you to view network utilization charts of VM VNICs connected to both SR-IOV enabled NICs and OVS switch. These charts help you determine if the VM utilization is optimal to create service chains.
AppNav-XE
This feature lets you configure policy-based redirection of LAN-to-WAN and WAN-to-LAN traffic flows to WAAS nodes for WAN optimization on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices . This feature was already available on Cisco IOS XE platforms and is being extended to Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN platforms in this release.
Monitor and Maintain
Event Notifications Support for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices
This feature adds support for event notifications, for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
Monitoring Event Trace for OMP Agent and SD-WAN Subsystem
This feature enables monitoring and controlling the event trace function for a specified SD-WAN subsystem. Event trace provides the functionality to capture the SD-WAN traces between the SD-WAN daemons and SD-WAN subsystems.
QoS Monitoring in Cisco vManage
This release extends the capability of viewing interface-wise QoS information through Cisco vManage to support Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. Before this release, QoS information for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices could only be monitored through device CLI.
Forwarding Serviceability
This feature enables service path and tunnel path under Simulate Flows function in the vManage template and displays the next-hop information for an IP packet. This feature enables Speed Test and Simulate Flow functions on the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
Admin-tech Enhancements
This feature enhances the admin tech file to include show tech-support memory , show policy-firewall stats platform and show sdwan confd-log netconf-trace commands in the admin-tech logs. The admin-tech tar file includes memory, platform, and operation details.
Command Reference
Enable Layer 7 Health Check to Zscaler
The Enable Layer 7 Health Check feature helps in maintaining tunnel health by providing ability to load balance or failover of the tunnels. For more information, see the tracker command.

Important Notes, Known Behavior, and Workaround
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices with the SFP-10G-SR module do not support online insertion and removal (OIR) of this module.
When you complete a Cisco SD-WAN software downgrade procedure on a device, the device goes into the configuration mode that it was in when you last upgraded the Cisco SD-WAN software on the device. If the device is in a different configuration mode when you start the downgrade than it was when you last upgraded, the device and Cisco vManage show different configuration modes after the downgrade completes. To put the configuration modes back in sync, reattach the device to a device template. After you reattach the device, both the device and Cisco vManage show that the device is in the vManage configuration mode.
Starting from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r, the behavior of the Cisco SD-WAN Overlay Management Protocol (OMP) routes changed. Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices install OMP routes in the Route Information Base (RIB) including the interface.
Example output starting from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r:
m 192.168.1.0/24 [251/0] via 10.10.10.13, 00:00:50, Sdwan-system-intf
Example output prior to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r:
m 192.168.1.0/24 [251/0] via 10.10.10.13, 00:00:09

Note
In cases where the static route’s next-hop may recurse over an OMP route, the OMP route installation behavior change starting from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r installs the static route in the routing table, such as for the following configured static route:
ip route 192.168.100.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1
The static IP route gets installed in the routing table starting from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r.
192.168.1.1 is considered fully resolved by way of OMP route 192.168.1.0/24 using 10.10.10.13 as the next-hop with an explicit specification of the egress interface (Sdwan-system-intf).
Prior to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r, 192.168.1.1 is considered unresolved because OMP route 192.168.1.0/24 using 10.10.10.13 as the next-hop does not have an explicit interface.
