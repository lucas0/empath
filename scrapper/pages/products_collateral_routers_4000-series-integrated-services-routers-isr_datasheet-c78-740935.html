The Cisco® 4000 Series Integrated Services Routers Network Interface Module (NIM) supports single-port Cisco Multimode Four-Pair G.SHDSL-based WAN connectivity using both 802.3ah Ethernet in the first mile (EFM) and ATM modes. This NIM is used in modular routers that are deployed in Small and Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs) and enterprise branch offices.
Product overview
Designed to deliver high-speed Ethernet services over Symmetrical High-speed DSL (SHDSL) access, the multimode G.SHDSL NIM (Figure 1) offers symmetric data rates over one to four pairs of copper wire and supports both EFM and ATM modes. To achieve higher bandwidths, bonding of multiple pairs (4-wire, m-pair, inverse multiplexing over EFM bonding) is supported.
Figure 1.      Cisco Multimode Four-Pair G.SHDSL NIM (NIM-4SHDSL-EA)
In EFM mode, the multimode G.SHDSL NIM allows bonding, as defined by IEEE 802.3ah, and is typically used in scenarios where individual links are aggregated using the 802.3ah loop aggregation. Depending on the number of wire pairs in service, the maximum data rate is 61.4 Mbps, with each line supporting up to 15 Mbps with 128-TCPAM. The NIM complies with the 2BASE-TL standard, which is based on the IEEE 802.3ah EFM standard. The 2BASE-TL standard uses the technology standard defined in ITU recommendation G.991.2 (G.SHDSL.).
In ATM mode, the multimode G.SHDSL NIM allows bonding of multiple pairs up to four pairs (8-wire) with increased bandwidth by using data interleaving and m-pair mode. In m-pair mode, the multimode four-pair G.SHDSL NIM offers data rates up to 5.7 Mbps per pair and up to 22.7 Mbps over four pairs. (See Table 2 for the data rates supported by the multimode four-pair G.SHDSL NIM (NIM-4SHDSL-EA) under different modes.)
The multimode four-pair G.SHDSL NIM cost-effectively allows service providers and enterprise customers to deliver Ethernet services to sites with no access to fiber by using bonded copper pairs with symmetrical bandwidth. These rates cover applications traditionally served by High-data-rate DSL (HDSL), Single-line DSL (SDSL), T1, E1, and services beyond E1.
The multimode four-pair G.SHDSL NIM, together with the ISR 4000 series router, provides businesses the necessary bandwidth for critical traffic such as voice and videoconferencing and enables customers to save money by integrating voice and data traffic on the same WAN link. Service providers can increase subscriber revenue by bundling services and offering differentiated service levels through Service-Level Agreements (SLAs).

Cisco Integrated Services Routers with multimode G.SHDSL EFM NIM applications
Business-class DSL with backup WAN
Cisco ISR 4000 routers with the four-pair G.SHDSL EFM NIM provide a business-class DSL solution for WAN access along with the option of a backup WAN interface (asymmetric DSL [ADSL] and ADSL2+, very-high-data-rate DSL 2 [VDSL2], ISDN Basic Rate Interface [BRI], T1/E1, analog modem, cable modem, third- and fourth-generation [3G and 4G, respectively], etc.) for mission-critical applications. The bonding feature offered on the G.SHDSL EFM NIM allows service providers to bond two or more pairs of G.SHDSL links to offer differentiated bandwidth based on SLAs.
Business-class security
Cisco ISR 4000 routers with the multimode G.SHDSL EFM NIMs can be optimized for Internet security with Cisco IOS Firewall supporting stateful inspection firewall and intrusion prevention system features. These platforms can also be optimized for VPNs to allow for secure use of the Internet for communications with the same policies and levels of security and performance as a private network. VPNs provide security through encryption tunneling, and the Cisco routers support hardware-based Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES) IP Security (IPsec), Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), and SSL VPN. Encryption features can be enabled on the routers with the Advanced Security or any later feature set of the Cisco IOS XE Software. Further, Cisco ISR 4000 Web Security with the Cisco Umbrella™ solution enables branch offices to intelligently redirect web traffic to the cloud to enforce granular security and control policy over dynamic content, protecting branch-office users from threats such as Trojan horses, back doors, rogue scanners, viruses, and worms.
Differentiated service offerings through IP
Using Cisco QoS features, including Class-Based Weighted Fair Queuing (CBWFQ), Low-Latency Queuing (LLQ), Weighted Random Early Detection (WRED), etc., the Cisco ISR 4000 routers with the G.SHDSL NIM help service providers and resellers offer services that can differentiate bandwidth based on a specific application or a specific user.
Metro Ethernet
Service providers could also run Layer 2 Ethernet services and provide transparent LAN services over a metro Ethernet infrastructure. Service providers can take advantage of ISR 4000 support for Xconnect over Multiprotocol Label Switching over Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) with Static Pseudowire Provisioning and L2PT on Layer 2 ports, Dot1Q tunnel mode support on Layer 2 ports, customizable L2PT tunneling MAC address etc., and provide these Layer 2 Ethernet services.
Converged platform for SMB and enterprise branch-office applications
The Cisco 4000 Series Integrated Services Routers with the multimode G.SHDSL EFM NIMs offer you a choice of converged platforms that offer best-in-class data, security, WAN access, and voice services in a single system. The ISR 4000 routers embed voice functions directly inside the router, enabling you to deploy voice services by installing Cisco 2800/3800 High-Density Packet Voice Digital Signal Processor modules and the Cisco Integrated Services Module for IP telephony conferencing, voice gateways, as well as Cisco Unity® Express voicemail and Automated Attendant. For call processing, you can enable the Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express solution as part of Cisco IOS XE Software and reconfigure the same software to support Survivable Remote Site Telephony (SRST) for centralized call processing with Unified Communications Manager.
Such an integrated solution rapidly enables service deployment, increases efficiency of network operations, and provides opportunities to protect, grow, and optimize your business.
