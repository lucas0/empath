Table 3 describes the types of licenses supported, the count for each license, and the maximum count for resources such as Mailbox, Voice Port, or IVR.

3.TimeCardView is an add-on application that enables you to track time and attendance. For more information, see the “Release Notes for TimeCardView 8.6” section.
* Licenses with Non-Rehostable (NR) are licenses that are installed in the factory, or licenses that are issued as a replacement for legacy licenses.
Note You do not have to buy IVR session licenses if you plan to use only voicemail and auto attendant with basic IVR applications. IVR session licenses are required only if your application contains advanced IVR features, such as email, fax, database access, or VXML scripts.

Each IVR session consumes one port, and thus reduces the number of ports available for use by voicemail and auto attendant. If the number of IVR session licenses is greater than or equal to the number of ports, then voicemail and auto attendant will be disabled due to the lack of available ports. Carefully consider how many IVR sessions you need and install or activate licenses only for that number of IVR sessions.
Table 4 lists the number of voice ports that are installed by default.

Cisco Unity Express Software License Activation
Cisco Unity Express requires that the software be activated using the Cisco Software Licensing (CSL) process. For more information, see Software Activation for Cisco Unity Express 7.1 and Later Versions.
Note When you upgrade to Cisco Unity Express Release 8.6.x from any release prior to Cisco Unity Express Release 7.1, you must replace your pre-CSL licenses with CSL licenses. You must migrate your licenses for the mailbox features and port features. If you have purchased the optional IVR features, you should also migrate your licenses for the IVR features.
Software Upgrade Overview
Depending on the Cisco Unity Express version you are upgrading from, different software upgrade methods are available. The following methods are supported to upgrade to Cisco Unity Express 8.6.x:
A clean installation process upgrade using the online installer with the software install clean command. For specific procedures, see the “Upgrading to Cisco Unity Express Using Clean Install” section in the Cisco Unity Express 8.6 Installation and Upgrade Guide.
Upgrade using the online installer with the software install upgrade command. For specific procedures, see the “Upgrading Cisco Unity Express Using Software Install Upgrade” section in the Cisco Unity Express 8.6 Installation and Upgrade Guide.
A clean installation process upgrade using the boot helper. For specific procedures, see the “Reinstalling a Cisco Unity Express Image Using the Boot Helper” section in the Cisco Unity Express 8.6 Installation and Upgrade Guide. We recommend that you use this upgrade process only if the other methods are unsuccessful.
Table 7 provides a matrix of the upgrade processes available for the different software versions for the supported modules. If you upgrade using either of the clean installation processes, the existing configuration files on the system are not preserved. Voice mails, greetings, or passwords configured on the system are lost.
To preserve your configuration, back up the existing configuration files and restore them after performing the upgrade. If the configuration files are not backed up before performing the upgrade, Cisco Unity Express must be reconfigured.

When planning your software upgrade, consider the following:
If you upgrade the software using the online installer, downgrading to an earlier software version is not supported.
Downgrading to a license with support for fewer personal mailboxes is not supported. If you want to change the system to support fewer mailboxes, and you cannot restore any previous backups on the larger system, you must purchase a new license and perform a new installation.
