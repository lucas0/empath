What's New in Cisco NCS 1004, IOS XR Release 7.3.2
Cisco is continuously enhancing the product with every release and this section covers a brief description of key features and enhancements. It also includes links to detailed documentation, where available.
Feature Description
Configuration
4X100GE MXP modes with QDD ZRP for OTN-XP Card
On the OTN-XP card, you can configure a single 4x100GE payload that is received over the client port as a 400GE signal over DWDM on the line side.
The card improves efficiency, performance, and flexibility for customer networks allowing 4x100GE client transport over 400GE WDM wavelength.
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Client
The DHCP client enables the router interfaces to dynamically acquire the IPv4 or DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 server which is used to forward the response to the correct layer 2 address. The DHCP client ensures that configuration information reaches the correct device.
GCC Support for OTN-XP Card
The node supports a maximum of 48 GCC (GCC0 and GCC1) channels for each OTN-XP card.
Hybrid Modes Using 40x10G-4x100G-MXP
With the 40x10G-4x100G-MXP muxponder mode support, you can configure the following hybrid modes:
20x10G + 2x100G
10x10G + 3 x 100G
With the 40x10G-4x100G-MXP muxponder mode support, you have flexibility to choose a combination of 10G and 100G client rates across different OTN and Ethernet client rates.
Inverse Muxponder Configuration on OTN-XP Card
The OTN-XP card supports inverse multiplexing for 400GE client over 2x200G CFP2 trunk ports. This feature allows you to split the 400GE client signal and carry it over 2x200G trunks thereby increasing the ease of signal reachability.
Commands modified:
hw-module (OTN-XP Card)
controller coherentDSP
Licensing Feature Update
Criteria for license consumption in Long Haul and Subsea networks are introduced. Long Haul (LH) and Subsea are two trunk-based license models that are implemented regardless of the line rate, in addition to the existing client-based licenses. These license models allow the user to easily track the status of licenses and software usage trends. The long-haul license is required to enable QPSK and 8QAM modes. The subsea license is required to enable BPSK and subsea specific controls such as extended chromatic dispersion, special non-linear compensation settings and so on.
Muxponder Configuration for 200G Trunk with QPSK and 8QAM Modulation
The OTN-XP card supports up to 200G trunk rate with QPSK and 8QAM modulation using CFP2. This feature enhances the signal reachability with reduced noise and can support the 50GHz network.
Commands modified:
hw-module (OTN-XP Card)
Muxponder Configuration for 300G Trunk with 8QAM Modulation
The OTN-XP card supports up to 300G trunk rate with 8QAM modulation using CFP2. This feature improves the signal reachability with decreased noise.
Commands modified:
hw-module (OTN-XP Card)
OC Support for AAA User
This feature allows all authorized users on XR VM to access administration data on the router through NETCONF or gRPC interface, similar to accessing the CLI. This functionality works by internally mapping the task group of the user on XR VM to a predefined group on System Admin VM. Therefore, the NETCONF and gRPC users can access the administrative information on the router even if their user profiles do not exist on System Admin VM.
Command added:
aaa authorization (System Admin-VM)
Hardware
Pluggables Support
The QSFP-100G-DR-S pluggable is supported.
Data Models
OC (Open Configuration) Support for Subsea Parameters
The OC (Open Configuration) support for subsea parameters is introduced. This enables the user to configure the subsea parameters using OC data models. This was defined under OC-platform as part of the vendor augmented data model.
OpenROADM
OpenROADM 200G and 300G Configuration Support
200G and 300G data rates can be configured for MXP.
Telemetry
gNMI Heartbeat Interval
The gNMI Heartbeat Interval feature allows you to send ON_CHANGE subscription data for each heartbeat interval regardless of change in value. This feature enables you to enhance the network management system.
