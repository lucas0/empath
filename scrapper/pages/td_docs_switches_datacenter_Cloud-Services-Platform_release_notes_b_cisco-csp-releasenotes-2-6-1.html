Guest VNFs

Some of the Cisco VNFs available include the following:

Cisco IOS® XRv 9000 Router
Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)
Cisco Firepower™ NGFW Virtual

Non-Cisco Vendor Owned VNFs
You can run VNFs owned by various vendors on Cisco CSP 5000 Series Platforms that are running on the CSP-OS. Formal support for these VNFs requires a joint effort between Cisco and the VNF vendor.
Cisco offers VNF vendors a "for-fee" NFVIS 3rd-party certification program to test and certify their VNFs on Cisco’s virtual platforms. After the testing and certification is complete, the results are published on this page- Cisco Enterprise NFV Open Ecosystem and Qualified VNF Vendors
For more specific support details about VNF versions and test compatibility matrix with CSP-OS releases, see the VNF vendor release documentation on the vendor support site.
