How to Buy
Cisco partners have you covered
Most customers work with a Cisco partner to buy Cisco products. Partners go through extensive training to get certified by Cisco to sell authentic Cisco products. Partners and some customers with a direct purchasing relationship use Cisco Commerce for quotes, configuring, pricing, and ordering.
