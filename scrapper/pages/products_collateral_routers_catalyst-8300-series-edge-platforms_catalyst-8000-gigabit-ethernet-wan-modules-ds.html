    Product overview
The Cisco® Catalyst® 8000 Gigabit Ethernet WAN Modules bring high-density Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP+ and SFP) and copper (RJ-45) connectivity, supporting 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, and 10 Gbps Ethernet, to the Catalyst 8300 and 8200 Series Edge Platforms.
These modules replace the Network Interface Module (NIM) and Single-Wide Enhanced Service Module (SM-X) Ethernet WAN modules supported on the Cisco 4000 Series Integrated Services Routers. Providing maximum flexibility, the modules accelerate applications such as Ethernet WAN access, Cisco SD-WAN, and other high-speed connectivity options to the LAN, top-of-rack data center switches, and servers. Support for SD-WAN and vManage is available from day 1 on all these modules.
The ports on these modules work as routed Layer 3 ports. All the features supported on the router’s embedded WAN ports are also available with these WAN modules.
Layer 2 switching between local ports on the module, or between ports on the module and other ports within the router system, is not supported. The ports on these modules terminate Layer 2 trunks from externally connected switches. As such, Layer 2 trunk and VLAN information is not carried over onto other ports in the system. The host router routes all traffic entering these modules.
Power over Ethernet (PoE IEEE 802.3 af/at/bt) is supported on the C-NIM-1M module.
This data sheet also covers the SM-NIM Carrier Adapter for the Catalyst 8300 Series. This carrier card enables all combinations of voice, WAN, and LAN modules to be hot-swappable and functioning in a Service Module (SM) slot. Up to 2 NIMs are supported per carrier card without any performance or functionality limitations.
Cisco offer three types of Ethernet WAN modules:
●      Cisco 1-port 10-Gbps/1-Gbps WAN with 256-bit WAN MACsec (C-NIM-1X) Figure 1
●      Cisco 2-port 100-Mbps/1-Gbps WAN NIM with 256-bit WAN MACsec (C-NIM-2T) Figure 2
●      Cisco 1-port 2.5-Gbps/1-Gbps WAN NIM with Cisco UPOE® (C-NIM-1M) Figure 3
Cisco offers one SM-NIM Carrier Adapter card:
●      Cisco single-wide service module for 2x NIMs (C-SM-NIM-ADPT) Figure 4
Figure 1.            
Cisco 1-port 10-Gbps/1-Gbps WAN with 256-bit WAN MACsec (C-NIM-1X)
The C-NIM-1X is a next-generation 10G Layer 3 WAN module. This module provides high-speed WAN connectivity through a single SFP+ port supporting 1-Gbps and 10-Gbps WAN connections. The 10-Gbps WAN connection is a non-oversubscribed connection, since it’s connecting to the backplane using a 10-Gbps link. Full 256-bit WAN MACsec is supported.
The C-NIM-1X does not support SFP transceivers for RJ-45 copper media, nor does it support 100BASE/10BASE SFP modules. The module is supported on all Catalyst 8300 Series platforms. It is not supported on the Catalyst 8200 Series platforms.
Figure 2.            
Cisco 2-port 100-Mbps/1-Gbps WAN NIM with 256-bit WAN MACsec (C-NIM-2T)
The C-NIM-2T is a dual combo port module with two RJ-45 copper line ports and two SFP fiber ports. The ports on this NIM are configured in two port groups with one RJ45 port and one SFP port in each group. One port from each group can be configured for simultaneous use, providing flexibility in the selection of media for WAN connectivity. The RJ-45 ports support 100BASE-TX and 1000BASE-T copper connections. The SFP ports support 100BASE-FX and 1000BASE-X fiber connections. The module supports 256-bit WAN MACsec. The C-NIM-2T is supported on the Catalyst 8200 Series, 8200L, and all 8300 Series platforms.
Figure 3.            
Cisco 1-port 2.5-Gbps/1-Gbps WAN NIM with UPOE (C-NIM-1M)
The C-NIM-1M is a single-port 2.5-Gbps BASE-T port module with Cisco UPOE+ (90W).
Its single copper port supports 100/1000/2500BASE-T connections, popularly called a Multigigabit (mGig) port. This module also supports Cisco UPOE+ (802.3bt, up to 90W), which can be used for powering a cellular gateway directly from the host router. The C-NIM-1M is supported on the Catalyst 8200 Series, 8200L, and all 8300 Series platforms.
Figure 4.            
Cisco single-wide service module carrier card for 2x NIMs (C-SM-NIM-ADPT)
The C-SM-NIM-ADPT is a dual-NIM carrier card in an SM-X form factor for Catalyst 8300 Series platforms. This module supports a wide variety of NIMs, including the C-NIM Layer 3 WAN modules for the Catalyst 8000 platforms. See Table 6 for a list of supported modules. Since it connects to the backplane with two 10-Gbps links, this carrier card will not impose any bottleneck on traffic, even if two 10-Gbps C-NIM-1X modules are installed. It supports full online insertion and removal. There is no upper limit on the number of C-SM-NIM-ADPT cards that can be installed in a Catalyst 8300 Series platform, other than available SM-X slots.
Features
The Cisco Catalyst 8000 Gigabit Ethernet WAN Modules are based on the technology of the onboard Gigabit Ethernet and SFP/SFP+ ports of the Cisco Catalyst 8000 Edge Platforms. Feature support will therefore be identical to that of the onboard ports on the Catalyst 8300 and 8200 Series and the 8200L.

Module LED indicators
The Gigabit Ethernet WAN modules have several EN (Enabled) or L (Link) LEDs located around the SFP, SFP+, and RJ-45 ports. The LEDs indicate that the module has passed its self-test and is available to the router.
Figures 5 through 7 show the front panel LED layout. Table 4 lists the LED colors and their meanings.

Installation
You can install service modules and network modules either before or after mounting the router. The 1- and 2-port NIMs also support the SM-X slot with the adapter card (C-SM-NIM-ADPT). The 1- and 2-port NIMs support full Online Insertion and Removal (OIR) when installed in the SM-X adapter card. When installed directly in a NIM slot, only online insertion is supported, not online removal. This means that you can insert a NIM directly into a NIM slot while the router is powered on, but you cannot remove it unless the router is powered down.
Warning: To comply with the Telcordia GR-1089 Network Equipment Building Standards (NEBS) for electromagnetic compatibility and safety, connect the Gigabit Ethernet ports only to intrabuilding or unexposed wiring or cable. The intrabuilding cable must be shielded and the shield must be grounded at both ends. The intrabuilding port(s) of the equipment or subassembly must not be metallically connected to interfaces that connect to the Outside Plant (OSP) or its wiring. These interfaces are designed for use as intrabuilding interfaces only for Type 2 or Type 4 ports as described in Telcordia GR-1089-CORE, and they require isolation from the exposed OSP cabling. The addition of primary protectors is not sufficient protection to connect these interfaces metallically to OSP wiring.
