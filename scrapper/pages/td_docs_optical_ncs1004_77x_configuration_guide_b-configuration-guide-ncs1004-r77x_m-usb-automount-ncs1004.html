USB Automount
When you insert a USB device in NCS 1004, it is automatically mounted in sysadmin-vm with Read and Write permissions and unmounted in XR by default. The USB device is automatically mounted in sysadmin-vm only when the file system of the USB device is FAT or FAT32. This feature allows you to read from or write files and folders onto the USB device without explicitly mounting it. You can access the mounted USB device as disk2: file system.
Unmount the USB device from sysadmin-vm before you remove it from NCS 1004. Use the mount command, if you want to mount the USB device again after you unmount the device but before physically removing it.
You can simultaneously mount the USB device in XR-vm and sysadmin-vm. Unmount the USB device from both sysadmin-vm and XR-vm before you remove it from NCS 1004.
Mount USB Device
To mount the USB device in sysadmin-vm, use the following command:
usb device operation mount
To mount the USB device in XR-vm, use the following command:
unmount disk2: undo
