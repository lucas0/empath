Note
We recommend that the Controller software version matches or be higher than the WAN edge device software version.
All device and controller combinations listed in this table have been validated. However, there are no software changes in this controller software release, which impact the device-to-controller backwards compatibility for previous releases that are not listed in the table.
UCS-E Series using External Interfaces are supported from Cisco SD-WAN Release 19.2.1 and later releases.
UCS-E Series using Internal Backplane Interfaces such as ucse x/y/0 and ucse x/y/1 have a limited feature support configurable using only Cisco vManage CLI templates, starting from Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.1.1 and later releases.
The Cisco vEdge 100M, Cisco vEdge 100B, Cisco vEdge 100wm and Cisco vEdge 1000 devices are impacted by a certificate expiry incident. If your Cisco vEdge devices are running Cisco SD-WAN Releases 19.2.x or older releases, or 18.4.x or older releases, upgrade to Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.3.7.1 for a stable user experience. For more information on upgrading to Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.3.7.1 see, Perform the upgrade.
