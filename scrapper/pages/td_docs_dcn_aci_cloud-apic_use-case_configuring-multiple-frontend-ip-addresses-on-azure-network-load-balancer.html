About Azure Network Load Balancers
An Azure Network Load Balancer (also known as Azure Load Balancer) is a Layer 4 device that distributes the in-bound flow packets based on Layer 4 ports.
There are two ways to deploy a Network Load Balancer:
Internal-facing: The Network Load Balancer is inserted as a service between the consumer cloud EPG and the provider cloud EPG. Using this configuration, an internal Network Load Balancer is used to load balance traffic across VMs inside an Azure VNet.
Internet-facing: The Network Load Balancer is inserted as a service between the consumer external EPG and the provider cloud EPG. Using this configuration, an internet or public Network Load Balancer is used to load balance internet traffic to backend VMs.
You configure a Network Load Balancer using a service graph. A typical configuration involves the following:
Creating a Layer 4 to Layer 7 services device for the Network Load Balancer.
Configuring the Network Load Balancer as a node in a service graph.
Note that the service graph could be a single-node service graph, where only the Network Load Balancer (NLB) is configured as a node in the service graph, as shown in the following graphic.
Or it could be a multi-node service graph, where additional service devices are also included in the service graph, such as a firewall or additional load balancers, as shown in the following graphic.
Creating one or more listeners in the EPG communication when a service graph is associated with a contract.
Listeners enable you to specify the ports and protocols (TCP or UDP) that the Network Load Balancer accepts and forwards traffic on. All listeners require you to configure at least one rule (a default rule, which does not have a condition). Rules enable you to specify the action that the Network Load Balancer takes when a condition is met; however, for Network Load Balancers, a rule can only forward traffic to a specific port of the backend pool.
The Network Load Balancer should be in a separate subnet, which should not be used to deploy other applications. There are two modes of operation in the Network Load Balancer:
Forward mode: Traffic is forwarded from a specific listener port to the specified backend port.
HA Port mode: The Network Load Balancer will load balance TCP and UDP flows on all the ports simultaneously.
Cisco Cloud APIC supports a Standard SKU Network Load Balancer only.
For more information, see the following:
What is Azure Load Balancer?
The "About Network Load Balancer" section in the "Deploying Layer 4 to Layer 7 Services" chapter in the Cisco Cloud APIC for Azure User Guide
About Multiple Frontend IP Addresses on the Azure Network Load Balancer
When configuring an internet-facing Network Load Balancer, the number of public IP addresses allowed to assign to frontend the internet traffic varies, depending on the release:
Prior to Cisco Cloud APIC release 25.0(3) and Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator release 3.7(1), an internet-facing Network Load Balancer has a single public IP address assigned to frontend the internet traffic. The following graphic shows an example of a multi-node service graph configuration, where an internet-facing Network Load Balancer is shown at the top of the graphic, followed by VMs or a firewall, then an internal-facing Network Load Balancer as parts of this multi-node service graph.
In this example, the internet-facing Network Load Balancer has a single public IP address assigned to frontend the internet traffic.
However, with this configuration, an issue might arise if you have a service graph and you need to expose multiple HTTPS services. Having the restriction of a single public IP address assigned to frontend the internet traffic for an internet-facing Network Load Balancer means that you cannot add more frontend IP addresses to that Network Load Balancer. In addition, you cannot add more Network Load Balancer in this situation due to a restriction from Azure, which does not allow multiple Network Load Balancers to share the same backend device (the firewalls in this example).
Beginning with Cisco Cloud APIC release 25.0(3) and Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator release 3.7(1), support is now available for configuring multiple frontend IP addresses for an internet-facing Network Load Balancer. With this update, each frontend IP address is attached to one or more rules to a specific backend pool.
The following graphic provides an example configuration where multiple frontend IP addresses are configured for an internet-facing Network Load Balancer.
This example configuration depicts the packet flow for the following listener rules:
Listener Rule (Frontend Configuration)
Rule Action (Backend Configuration)
Rule1
IP: VIP1
Port: 80
Port: 80
Rule2
IP: VIP2
Port: 80
Port: 81
The service graph allows you to configure the settings for the listener rule and the rule action on services devices. When defined on a Network Load Balancer, the listener rule and rule action settings construct a mapping from a frontend configuration of the load balancer to a backend pool. Prior to Cisco Cloud APIC release 25.0(3) and Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator release 3.7(1), an internet-facing Network Load Balancer provided the ability to configure listeners with a single frontend IP address but with different port and protocol combinations. Beginning with Cisco Cloud APIC release 25.0(3) and Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator release 3.7(1), with the support for configuring multiple frontend IP addresses for an internet-facing Network Load Balancer, that ability is extended to configure listener rules with multiple frontends where each frontend is represented as a tuple combination of frontend IP addresses, port, and protocol.
Guidelines and Limitations
Following are the guidelines and limitations with the support for configuring multiple frontend IP addresses for an internet-facing Network Load Balancer:
Support for multiple frontend IP addresses is available only for an internet-facing Network Load Balancer.
Backend port reuse across multiple listener rules is not supported.
Deploying a Service Graph
The service graph enables you to define how traffic flows between devices, how the traffic comes into the network, which devices the traffic passes through, and how the traffic leaves the network.
The service graph can be deployed in two ways:
Single-node service graph: Only one device is deployed.
Multi-node service graph: Up to three nodes can be added to the service chain.
Before you can deploy a service graph in either a single-node or multi-node configuration, you must configure the following:
A tenant
An application profile
A consumer EPG
A provider EPG
A VRF
A cloud context profile
A contract with a filter
Configuring Multiple Frontend IP Addresses on Azure Network Load Balancer for Cisco Cloud APIC

Frontend IP Names
Beginning with release 25.0(3), support is available for configuring multiple frontend IP addresses for an internet-facing Network Load Balancer.
By default, a single frontend IP address will automatically be created for the internet-facing Network Load Balancer. This is the existing behavior that is available prior to release 25.0(3).
If you want additional frontend IP addresses for the internet-facing Network Load Balancer, click + Add Frontend IP Name. This is new behavior that is introduced in release 25.0(3). For more information, see Understanding Configurations for Multiple Frontend IP Addresses on the Azure Network Load Balancer.
Adding frontend IP names in this area tells Azure that you want multiple frontend IP addresses to be assigned to this internet-facing Network Load Balancer. Each frontend IP name that you enter in this area results in a single additional frontend IP address.
The public frontend IP addresses in this area (the default frontend IP address and any additional frontend IP addresses) are then assigned by Azure.
Click + Add Frontend IP Name to add a name for an additional frontend IP address that you want Azure to assign for the Network Load Balancer.
Enter a name for the additional frontend IP address, then click the tick mark on the right to confirm the new frontend IP name.
Click + Add Frontend IP Name again to add additional names for additional frontend IP addresses that you want Azure to assign for the Network Load Balancer.
For example, assume that you want a total of three frontend IP addresses for the internet-facing Network Load Balancer:
The first of the three frontend IP addresses is automatically assigned by default, using existing behavior that is available prior to release 25.0(3).
You would then click + Add Frontend IP Name twice, entering two separate frontend IP names (for example, frontend2 and frontend3), to signal to Azure that you want Azure to assign a total of three frontend IP addresses for the internet-facing Network Load Balancer.
Step 5
Click Save when finished.
The Create Service Graph dialog box appears.
To see the frontend IP addresses associated with the default and configured frontend IP names:
Navigate to Application Management > Services > Devices.
Double-click on the configured service device to bring up the Overview page for that service device.
Click on Cloud Resources > Frontend IP Names.
The default frontend IP address will be shown with the Default tag in this details page.
Configuring Multiple Frontend IP Addresses on Azure Network Load Balancer for Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator
The following topics describe how to configure multiple frontend IP addresses on the Azure Network Load Balancer for Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator.
Understanding How Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator Implements the Multiple Frontend IP Address Feature
The multiple front-end IP address feature is supported in Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator release 3.7(1). In order to implement this feature as decribed in Understanding Configurations for Multiple Frontend IP Addresses on the Azure Network Load Balancer for Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator, you must first configure the internet-facing Azure Network Load Balancer service device in Cisco Cloud APIC. Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator will then pull the configuration that you did when you configured the internet-facing Azure Network Load Balancer service device in Cisco Cloud APIC. Then, you will configure the service graph and listeners in Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator using the service device that you configured in Cisco Cloud APIC.

Note
This feature will only work in Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator 3.7(1) with Azure Cloud APIC version 25.0.3 or higher.
For more information, see Understanding Configurations for Multiple Frontend IP Addresses on the Azure Network Load Balancer

Procedure
Step 1
Navigate to Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator.
Step 2
Under Application Management, choose Schema.
Step 3
Select the Schema where you want to expose multiple front-end IP addresses on the Network Load Balancer.
Step 4
Under Template, select your template.
Step 5
Create service graph, and under common properties, fill-in service graph template Display Name then choose and drag Load Balaner icon from Services Nodes menu to build graph.
Step 6
Select the template, under Sites.
Step 7
Choose the Service Graph, and under Template properties select Load Balancer.

Deploying Layer 4 to Layer 7 Services
Procedure
Step 1
Navigate to the Schema and select your template.
Step 2
Under Contracts, select the contract. In the template level properties, choose the service graph that contains the internet-facing Network Load Balancer that you configured in the previous section.
Step 3
Once you have attached the contract to the service graph, go to the local site-level template properties and choose the same contract to configure the Listener.
Step 4
Click the internet-facing Network Load Balancer.
Step 5
From the pop-up window, choose Add Listener.
Step 6
Determine which Front-end IP address you will use to configure load balancer listener.
If you want to configure the cloud load balancer listener on the default front-end IP address, do nothing (skip past the Select a Frontend IP Name field). The default front-end IP address is configured for the cloud load balancer in this case, which is the existing behavior that is available before release 3.7(1).
If you want to configure the cloud load balancer listener on an additional front-end IP address associated with the front-end IP name that you configured when you created the service device for this internet-facing Network Load Balancer in the Cloud APIC, click Select a Front-end IP Name.This is new behavior that is introduced in release 3.7(1). Select the Front-end IP Name that you want to use.
