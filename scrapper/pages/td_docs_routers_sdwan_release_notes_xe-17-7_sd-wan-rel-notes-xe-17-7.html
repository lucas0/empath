Table 1. Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.1a
Feature Description
Cisco SD-WAN Getting Started
Support for the Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge Software Platform on OpenStack Train
This feature introduces support for managing a Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge software platform hosted in the OpenStack cloud computing platform "Train" release.
Day 0 WAN Interface Automatic IP Detection using ARP
This feature enables a device to automatically learn about the available IP addresses and default gateway information when a DHCP server is not available. The device assigns an IP address to its WAN interface, and then contacts the PnP server and begins the PnP onboarding process.
Certificate Revocation
This feature revokes enterprise certificates from devices based on a certificate revocation list that Cisco vManage obtains from a root certificate authority.
DigiCert Migration
This feature replaces the Symantec Certificate Authority (CA) server with Digicert Certificate Authority server for signing the controller device certificates on Cisco SD-WAN controllers including Cisco vSmart Controller, Cisco vBond Orchestrator, and Cisco vManage. You can protect, verify, and authenticate the identities of organizations and domains using these certificates.
Cisco SD-WAN Systems and Interfaces
Cisco Unified Border Element Configuration
This feature lets you configure Cisco Unified Border Element functionality by using Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device CLI templates or CLI add-on feature templates.
Cisco ThousandEyes Support for Cisco 1000 Series Integrated Services Routers
You can deploy Cisco ThousandEyes Enterprise agent natively as a container application on Cisco ISR 1100X-6G devices.
Support for HSRP and HSRP Authentication on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices
This feature allows you to configure HSRPv2 and HSRP authentication on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN platforms via CLI template. HSRP is a long-standing Cisco proprietary First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP) to support version 2 of the protocol and authentication.
Added Support for Configuring Geofencing Using a Cisco System Feature Template
This feature adds support for configuring the geographical boundary of a device using a Cisco System feature template.
With this feature, you can also configure automatic geolocation detection, where the device determines its own location, while configuring geofencing. A new parameter auto-detect-geofencing-location is added to the geolocation (system) command.
VRRP Interface Tracking for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices
This feature enables VRRP to set the edge as active or standby based on the WAN Interface or SIG tracker events and increase the TLOC preference value on a new VRRP active to ensure traffic symmetry, for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
TCP/UDP Endpoint tracker and Dual Endpoint Static route tracker for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices
This feature enables you to configure the TCP/UDP individual Endpoint static route tracker and to configure tracker group with IPv4, TCP/UDP Dual Endpoint static route trackers for service VPNs to enhance the reliability of the probes.
DHCP for IPv6
This feature allows you to configure DHCP for IPv6 (DHCPv6) on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices to assign IPv6 addresses to hosts on an IPv6-enabled network.
Assigning of IPv6 addresses is accomplished using SLAAC, DHCPv6 with SLAAC, DHCPv6 with SLAAC, DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation, or DHCPv6 Relay.
A Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device can be configured for DHCPv6 as a DHCP server, DHCP client, or as a DHCP relay agent.
Hierarchical SD-WAN
Hierarchical SD-WAN provides the ability to divide the architecture of the Cisco SD-WAN overlay network into multiple regional networks that operate distinctly from one another, and a central core-region network for managing inter-regional traffic.
The hierarchical architecture enables you to use different traffic transport service providers for each region, and for the central core-region network, to optimize cost and traffic performance. It also simplifies traffic configuration for some scenarios, and provides a robust, adaptive topology that can help prevent routing failures in specific network scenarios.
Co-Management: Granular Role-Based Access Control for Feature Templates
This feature introduces greater granularity in assigning role-based access control (RBAC) permissions for template use. This enables you to give a tenant self-management of network configuration tasks. Network administrators and managed service providers can use this feature to assign permissions to their end customers.
Cisco SD-WAN Routing
RIPv2 support on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices
This feature enables you to configure RIPv2 on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. Routers redistribute RIPv2 routes to OMP for advertisement in the SD-WAN overlay and to OSPFv3 for service-side routing.
Cisco SD-WAN Policies
Configure Default AAR and QoS Policies
This feature is an enhancement to the centralized and localized policies feature. This feature allows you to configure default application-aware routing (AAR) and quality of service (QoS) policies on Cisco IOS XE devices.
Flexible Netflow for VPN0 Interface
This feature supports Netflow on VPN0 interfaces.
Flexible Netflow acts as a security tool, enables exporting data to Cisco vManage and detects attacks on devices and monitors traffic.
Cisco SD-WAN Security
Configure Interface Based Zones and Default Zone
This feature enables you to configure an interface-based firewall policy to control traffic between two interfaces or an interface-VPN-based firewall policy to control traffic between an interface and a VPN group.
This feature also provides support for default zone where a firewall policy can be configured on a zone pair that consist of a zone and a default zone.
Resource Limitations and Device-global Configuration Options
This feature enables you to define resource limitation options such as idle timeout and session limits, and device-global options in the policy summary page to fine-tune a firewall policy behaviour after a firewall policy is implemented in Cisco SD-WAN.
Unified Logging for Security Connection Events
This feature supports Unified Logging which is used to capture information about connection events across different security features at different stages during policy enablement and execution.
With Unified Logging, you can have visibility to the log data for Zone-based Firewall and for Unified Threat Defense features such as IPS, URL-F and AMP to understand what traffic, threats, sites or malware were blocked, and the rules that blocked the traffic or sessions with the associated port, protocol or applications.
Additionally, this feature also provides support for On-Demand Troubleshooting. On-Demand troubleshooting allows a user to view the connection events of different flows of traffic from a device within a configured period of time.
GRE Over IPsec Tunnels Between Cisco IOS XE Devices
This feature allows you to set up GRE over IPsec tunnels with IKEv2 RSA-SIG authentication on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices in the controller mode to connect to Cisco IOS XE devices in the autonomous mode. This set up enables Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices to use OSPFv3 as the routing protocol and multicast traffic across the WAN network.
You can configure GRE over IPsec tunnels using the CLI device templates in Cisco vManage.
High Availability
Disaster Recovery User Password Change
This feature lets you change the disaster recovery user password for disaster recovery components from the Cisco vManage Disaster Recovery window.
Cisco SD-WAN Cloud OnRamp
Cloud onRamp for SaaS Support for Webex
Added Webex to the list of cloud applications for which Cloud onRamp for SaaS can determine the best network path to the cloud server. Cisco vManage periodically downloads a list of Webex servers organized by geographic region. Cloud onRamp for SaaS uses this server list to help calculate the best network path for Webex traffic in different regions.
Support for Using Microsoft Telemetry Metrics for Microsoft 365 SharePoint and Teams Traffic.
This feature adds support for using Microsoft telemetry metrics for Microsoft 365 SharePoint and Teams (Skype). Cloud onRamp for SaaS uses the metrics data when determining the best path for Office 365 traffic.
Azure Scaling, Audit, and Security of Network Virtual Appliances
This feature allows you to edit the SKU Scale value, carry out the audit to identify discrepancies, and have better security for your Network Virtual Appliances (NVAs).
Support for Cisco VM Image Upload in qcow2 Format
This feature allows you to upload a virtual machine image to Cisco vManage in qcow2 format. Earlier, you could upload only a prepackaged image file in tar.gz format.
Packet Capture for Cloud onRamp Colocation Clusters
This feature lets you capture packets at either the physical interface level (PNIC) or the virtual interface level (VNIC) on a CSP device of a colocation cluster. You can capture packets on one or more PNICs or VNICs on the same device or different devices with different browsers at the same time. This feature lets you gather information about the packet format and therefore helps in application analysis, security, and troubleshooting.
Cisco SD-WAN Monitor and Maintain
Additional Diagnostics Information Added to Admin-Tech File
This feature enhances the output of the admin-tech file with additional diagnostics information collected from the application server, the configuration database, the statistics database, and other internal services.
Upload an Admin-Tech File to a TAC Case
This feature enables you to upload an admin-tech file directly from Cisco vManage when opening a TAC case.
When you create a TAC case, you can upload the generated admin-tech files to TAC service requests (SRs) from Cisco vManage. This streamlines the steps required for working with TAC to troubleshoot a problem.
Bidirectional Packet Capture for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices
This feature enhances the embedded packet capture functionality to support bidirectional packet capture through Cisco vManage.
Software Upgrade Using a Remote Server
This feature enables you to upgrade device or controller software using software images stored on a remote server. The feature enables you to register a remote server with Cisco vManage, and add locations of software images on the remote server to the Cisco vManage software repository. When you upgrade device or controller software, the device or controller can download the new software image from the remote server.
This feature also improves the listing of images available in the repository. When two or more images have the same version but different filenames, each image is listed as a separate entry.
Enhanced Cisco vManage User Interface for a Consolidated Monitoring View
This feature introduces the enhanced user interface of Cisco vManage. The Monitor window provides a single-page, real-time user interface that facilitates a consolidated view of all monitoring components and services of a Cisco SD-WAN overlay network. It provides an entry point for all Cisco vManage dashboards, including Main Dashboard, VPN Dashboard, Security, and Multicloud. These dashboards were earlier accessible from the Dashboard menu. In addition, all monitoring components have been organized into pill buttons in the user interface so that you can quickly navigate from one page to another.
The Tools menu of Cisco vManage has also been enhanced in this release. The Network Wide Path Insight and On Demand Troubleshooting options that were earlier accessible from the Monitor menu have now been moved to the Tools menu so that you can easily locate these features.
Cisco SD-WAN SNMP
Support for SNMPv3 AES-128 and AES-256 bit Encryption Protocol
This feature allows you to configure SNMPv3 users in support with SHA-1 authentication protocol and AES-128 and AES-256 encryption on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
Cisco SD-WAN NAT
Dual Endpoint Support for Interface Status Tracking on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices
This feature allows you to configure tracker groups with dual endpoints using the Cisco System template and associate each template group to an interface. The dual endpoints provide redundancy for tracking the status of transport interfaces to avoid false negatives.
Intra-VPN Service-Side NAT Support
Intra-VPN allows service-side LAN interfaces to communicate with other service-side LAN interfaces within the same VPN. Configure the ip nat outside command on the LAN interface for which you require translation of the source IP addresses to the outside local addresses. You can apply static or dynamic NAT rules for packets to be routed from other LAN interfaces to the interface configured as the outside interface.
You configure intra-VPN service-side NAT using a device CLI template or a CLI add-on template.
NAT66 DIA Support
The IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Address Translation (NAT66) Direct Internet Access (DIA) feature enables an IPv6 device to translate an inside source address prefix to an outside source address prefix in IPv6 packet headers.
NAT66 DIA allows you to direct local IPv6 internet traffic to exit directly to the internet from the service-side VPN (VPN 1) through the transport VPN (VPN 0).
You configure NAT66 DIA using Cisco vManage, the CLI, or a device CLI template.
This feature introduces new CLI commands. For more information, see the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Qualified Command Reference Guide.
Cisco SD-WAN Remote Access
SD-WAN Remote Access
Remote access refers to enabling secure access to an organization's network from devices at remote locations.
Cisco SD-WAN remote access (SD-WAN RA) integrates remote access functionality into Cisco SD-WAN. SD-WAN RA enables Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices to function as RA headends, managed through Cisco vManage. This eliminates the need for separate Cisco SD-WAN and RA infrastructure, and enables rapid scalability of RA services.
RA users can use the same software- or hardware-based RA clients as with solutions that do not integrate with Cisco SD-WAN. For RA users, benefits include extending Cisco SD-WAN features to remote users. RA users can access applications hosted on-premises, applications hosted in IaaS, SaaS applications, or the internet
New and Enhanced Hardware Features

Software and Hardware Behavior Changes in Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.2
Behavior Change
Description
SNMP appRoute MIB object identifiers (OIDs) are added to support Mean Jitter, Latency, and Packet Drop data requests from SNMP.
A note is added in the Supported SNMP MIBs section.
A notification is generated when there is an SNMP trap for a Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) state change.
BFD state change entries are added in the Information About SNMP Traps and Notifications tables.
A new command alarms alarm bfd-state-change-syslog is added for enabling or disabling BFD syslog messages.
A new command alarms alarm bfd-state-change syslog is added.
A note is added in the Using the CLI section.
A limitation on real-time display of omp routes received and advertised in Cisco vManage is added to avoid excessive CPU usage.
A note is added in the OMP Route Redistribution section.
Important Notes, Known Behavior, and Workaround
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices with the SFP-10G-SR module do not support online insertion and removal (OIR) of this module.
Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1 implements a hardened security posture to comply with FedRamp guidelines. As a result, your vAnalytics login credentials that are stored locally get erased on upgrading the software, and you cannot access the vAnalytics service directly through Cisco vManage. In this case, log in to vAnalytics using this URL: https://analytics.viptela.com. If you can’t find your vAnalytics login credentials, open a case with Cisco TAC support.
Starting from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.5.1a, the table keyword is added to all show sdwan commands for which the output needs to be displayed in a tabular format. Using | tab is restricted for all Cisco SD-WAN commands starting from Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Release 16.11.x.
