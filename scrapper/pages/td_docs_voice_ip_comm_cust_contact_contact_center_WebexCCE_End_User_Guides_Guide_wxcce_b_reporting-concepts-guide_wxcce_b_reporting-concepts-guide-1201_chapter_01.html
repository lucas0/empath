Overview
Cisco Unified Intelligence Center is a reporting platform for users of Cisco Contact Center products. It is a web-based application that provides Historical, Real-time, and Live Data reporting and dashboards.
Unified Intelligence Center serves the following primary purposes:
Obtains data from the base solution's database. The base solution can be any of the Contact Center products.
Allows you to create custom queries to obtain specific data.
Customizes the visual presentation of the reports.
Customizes the report data.
Allows different groups of people to view specific data based on their roles.
Customer Journey Analyzer
Unified Intelligence Center users can use the reporting platform to launch Customer Journey Analyzer using Analyzer from the left navigation pane.
You can customize the default Analyzer URL using the CLI set cuic analyzer url <urlname>.
For more information on the CLI, see Cisco Unified Intelligence Center Administration Guide at https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/customer-collaboration/unified-intelligence-center/products-maintenance-guides-list.html.
The Customer Journey Analyzer mines historical data from multiple data sources and systems to generate specific business views of data. The Analyzer visually displays trends to help you identify patterns and gain insight for continuous improvement.

Note
You must have completed the on boarding process for Cloud Connect to access Customer Journey Analyzer. Cloud Connect allows Cisco Contact Center on premises customers to connect to cloud services, such as Customer Journey Analyzer to use Business Metrics.
For more information, see Business Metrics related information in Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise Features Guide at https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/customer-collaboration/unified-contact-center-enterprise/products-feature-guides-list.html.

The URL for logging in to the Unified Intelligence Center reporting application is:

Where HOST is the DNS name of a Unified Intelligence Center node.

Note
Cisco Unified Intelligence Center does not support HTTP.
Stock Reports
The following report bundles are available as stock reports for Cisco Unified Intelligence Center:
Realtime and Historical Transitional templates - Introductory templates designed for new users. These templates are simplified versions of the All Fields templates, and are similar to templates available in other contact center solutions.
Realtime and Historical All Fields templates - Templates that provide data from all fields in a database. These templates are most useful as a basis for creating custom reports, and include templates for precision queue routing data.
Realtime and Historical Outbound templates - Templates for reporting on Outbound Option activity. Import these templates if your deployment includes Outbound Option.
Live Data templates - Templates for reports that use the Live Data stream processing system as a data source. Refresh rates for these reports are much faster than the Realtime or Historical reports--usually less than every 3 seconds. Reports are available for Agent, Agent Skill Group, Precision Queue, Skill Group, Recent State History and Recent Call History.
Contact Sharing templates - Templates for reporting on a Contact Sharing system. You can use the Contact Sharing reports to understand the current configuration and behavior of the Contact Sharing system. You can view data on the active configuration of the Contact Sharing routing, the number of calls routed to each target system for each group, and the calls that have errors during the routing process.
Cisco Unified Intelligence Center Admin Security templates - Templates to report on Cisco Unified Intelligence Server audit trails, permissions, and template ownership.
Realtime and Historical Customer Collaboration Platform templates - Templates for reporting on Customer Collaboration Platform activity. Import these templates if your deployment includes Customer Collaboration Platform.
The report bundles are available as downloads from Cisco.com. Click the Intelligence Center Reports link on the downloads page (https://software.cisco.com/download/type.html?mdfid=282163829&catid=null). Depending on how it was deployed, your installation of Unified Intelligence Center may include all or a subset of these reports.
Customize Report Templates
You can modify existing report templates or create custom reports templates if you determine that the stock report templates do not meet your reporting needs. For example, you might customize an existing report template to monitor a department's activity and performance by creating a collection with objects from only that department.
See the at https://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps9755/tsd_products_support_series_home.html for directions on customizing report templates.
