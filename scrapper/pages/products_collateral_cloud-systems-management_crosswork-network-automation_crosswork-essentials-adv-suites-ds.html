    A simpler and easier way to get the automation tools your need for your network.
Product overview
Cisco Crosswork® Network Automation is a portfolio of tools designed to give your organization the ability to move quickly and precisely in this dynamic business and technical environment. The portfolio is built around three operational capabilities:
Visibility
Establish ground truth regarding what is happening in the network, a view of the current state of devices, and the ability to verify customer experience
Insights
Apply analytics to gathered data to identify trends and patterns both for planning and problem resolution
Action
Automate operational processes, provide programmatic control of infrastructure, and reduce the latency of end-to-end workflows
Crosswork is designed with modern low/no-touch operations in mind. It is multivendor and multidomain, centered on both programmatic infrastructure control and access to operational and state data, and spans both cloud/SaaS and on-premises tooling. The tools in the portfolio encompass the full-service lifecycle and deliver a closed operational loop that includes planning and design, implementation, and ongoing monitoring and assurance.
While elements of the Crosswork portfolio can be licensed individually, to simply designing and deploying automation, Crosswork is also available packaged in two suite options. These suites group tools that share a common purpose and also provide the advantage of lower licensing costs than if you purchased tools individually.

Licensing
Crosswork Essentials and Advantage are sold as suites. Customers interested in individual applications from the suite should consider a la carte options for each of the applications.
The licensing of the Crosswork Automation suites is based on three factors:
1.     A flat annual fee that grants you access (Right to Use or RTU) to the base application software included in the suite
2.     A per-device Right-To-Manage (RTM) fee
3.     1-year to 5-year term contracts
Product sustainability
Energy efficiency and renewable energy are not enough—Cisco continues to transform the way that products are made and managed throughout their lifecycles. Cisco is committed to designing and managing its products and packaging for reuse, repair, and resource efficiency.
Implementing automation and orchestration tools with Crosswork reduces the need for truck rolls and, consequently, emissions. ASIC breakthroughs, right-sizing of the network, and streamlining operations contribute to power efficiency gains of more than 60% and reduce the total carbon footprint of your business.

Installation requirements for each Crosswork Essentials and Advantage component are available in the respective individual product data sheets or the installation guides available on www.cisco.com/go/crosswork.
