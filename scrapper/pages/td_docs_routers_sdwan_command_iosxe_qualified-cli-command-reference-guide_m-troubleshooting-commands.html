Usage Guidelines
This show command displays the content of the RBACL permission matrix. You can specify the source SGT by using the from keyword and the destination SGT by using the to keyword. When both from and to are specified the RBACLs of a single cell are displayed. An entire column is displayed when only the to is used. An entire row is displayed when the from keyword is used.
The entire permission matrix is displayed when both the from clause and to keywords are omitted.
The command output is sorted by destination SGT as a primary key and the source SGT as a secondary key. The RBACLs for each cell is displayed in the same order they are defined in the configuration or acquired from Cisco ACS.
The details keyword is provided when a single cell is selected by specifying both from and to keywords. When the details keyword is specified the ACEs of the RBACLs of a single cell are displayed.
The following is sample output from the show cts role-based permissions command:
Device# show cts role-based permissions

show inventory
To display the product inventory listing of all Cisco products installed in the networking device, use the showinventory command in privileged EXEC mode.
show inventory [ entity | fru entity | oid entity | raw entity ]
Syntax Description
entity
(Optional) Name of a Cisco entity (for example, chassis, backplane, module, or slot). A quoted string may be used to display a specific UDI information; for example “module 0” displays UDI information for slot 0 of an entity named module.
fru
(Optional) Retrieves information about all Field Replaceable Units (FRUs) installed in the Cisco networking device.
oid
(Optional) Retrieves information about the vendor-specific hardware registration identifier, referred to as object identifier (OID).
raw
(Optional) Retrieves information about all Cisco products referred to as entities installed in the Cisco networking device, even if the entities do not have a product ID (PID) value, a unique device identifier (UDI), or other physical identification.
Command Default

Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco SD-WAN Manager CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
The show inventory command retrieves and displays inventory information about each Cisco product in the form of a UDI. The UDI is a combination of three separate data elements: a product identifier (PID), a version identifier (VID), and the serial number (SN).
The PID is the name by which the product can be ordered; it has been historically called the "Product Name" or "Part Number". This is the identifier that one would use to order an exact replacement part.
The VID is the version of the product. Whenever a product has been revised, the VID will be incremented. The VID is incremented according to a rigorous process derived from Telcordia GR-209-CORE, an industry guideline that governs product change notices.
The SN is the vendor-unique serialization of the product. Each manufactured product will carry a unique serial number assigned at the factory, which cannot be changed in the field. This is the means by which to identify an individual, specific instance of a product.
The UDI refers to each product as an entity. Some entities, such as a chassis, will have sub-entities like slots. Each entity will display on a separate line in a logically ordered presentation that is arranged hierarchically by Cisco entities.
Use the show inventory command without options to display a list of Cisco entities installed in the networking device that are assigned a PID.
Example
The following example shows how to display the inventory in the device.

i—Entry originated from an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) and was advertised with a network router configuration command.
e—Entry originated from an Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP).
?—Origin of the path is not clear. Usually, this is a router that is redistributed into BGP from an IGP.
Network
IP address of a network entity.
Next Hop
IP address of the next system that is used when forwarding a packet to the destination network. An entry of 0.0.0.0 indicates that the router has some non-BGP routes to this network.
Metric
If shown, the value of the interautonomous system metric.
LocPrf
Local preference value as set with the set local-preference route-map configuration command. The default value is 100.

IP address of the next system that is used when forwarding a packet to the destination network. An entry of 0.0.0.0 indicates that the router has some non-BGP routes to this network.
RIB-failure
Cause of the Routing Information Base (RIB) failure. Higher admin distance means that a route with a better (lower) administrative distance, such as a static route, already exists in the IP routing table.
RIB-NH Matches
Route status that applies only when Higher admin distance appears in the RIB-failure column and the bgp suppress-inactive command is configured for the address family being used. There are three choices:
Yes—Means that the route in the RIB has the same next hop as the BGP route or that the next hop recurses down to the same adjacency as the BGP next hop.
No—Means that the next hop in the RIB recurses down differently from the next hop of the BGP route.
n/a—Means that the bgp suppress-inactive command is not configured for the address family being used.

In the following example, BGP Event-Based VPN Import feature configuration information is shown. When the import path selection command is configured with the all keyword, any path that matches an RD of the specified VRF will be imported, even though the path does not match the Route Targets (RT) imported by the specified VRF. In this situation, the imported path is marked as “not-in-vrf” as shown in the output. Note that on the net for vrf-A, this path is not the best path because any paths that are not in the VRFs appear less attractive than paths in the VRF.

Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco SD-WAN Manager CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
The Cisco IOS software automatically enters a directly connected route in the routing table if the interface is usable (which means that it can send and receive packets). If an interface is not usable, the directly connected routing entry is removed from the routing table. Removing the entry lets the software use dynamic routing protocols to determine backup routes to the network, if any.
If the interface can provide two-way communication, the line protocol is marked up. If the interface hardware is usable, the interface is marked up.
If you specify an optional interface type, information for that specific interface is displayed. If you specify no optional arguments, information about all the interfaces is displayed.
Example
The following example shows how to display interface information on all interfaces.

The following is sample output from the show ip route ip-address mask longer-prefixes command. When this keyword is included, the address-mask pair becomes the prefix, and any address that matches that prefix is displayed. Therefore, multiple addresses are displayed. The logical AND operation is performed on the source address 0.0.0.0 and the mask 0.0.0.0, resulting in 0.0.0.0. Each destination in the routing table is also logically ANDed with the mask and compared with 0.0.0.0. Any destinations that fall into that range are displayed in the output.

       Route metric is 20, traffic share count is 1
When an IS-IS router advertises its link-state information, the router includes one of its IP addresses to be used as the originator IP address. When other routers calculate IP routes, they store the originator IP address with each route in the routing table.
The preceding example shows the output from the show ip route command for an IP route generated by IS-IS. Each path that is shown under the Routing Descriptor Blocks report displays two IP addresses. The first address (10.22.22.2) is the next-hop address. The second is the originator IP address from the advertising IS-IS router. This address helps you determine the origin of a particular IP route in your network. In the preceding example, the route to 0.0.0.0/0 was originated by a device with IP address 10.191.255.247.
The table below describes the significant fields shown in the display.

show sdwan app-route stats
To display statistics about data plane traffic jitter, loss, and latency and other interface characteristics for all operational data plane tunnels on Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices, use the show sdwan app-route stats command in privileged EXEC mode.
show sdwan app-route stats { [ local-color color ] | [ remote-color color ] | [ remote-system-ip ip-address ] }
Syntax Description
local-color color
(Optional) Displays statistics about data plane traffic jitter, loss, and latency and other interface characteristics for the specified local color.
remote-color color
(Optional) Displays statistics about data plane traffic jitter, loss, and latency and other interface characteristics for the specified remote color.
remote-system-ip ip-address
(Optional) Displays statistics about data plane traffic jitter, loss, and latency and other interface characteristics for the specified remote system IP.
Command Default

Command Modes
Privileged EXEC (#)
Command History
Release Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco SD-WAN Manager CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol runs over all data plane tunnels between Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices, monitoring the liveness, and network and path characteristics of the tunnels. Application-aware routing uses the information gathered by BFD to determine the transmission performance of the tunnels. Performance is reported in terms of packet latency and packet loss on the tunnel.
BFD sends Hello packets periodically to test the liveness of a data plane tunnel and to check for faults on the tunnel. These Hello packets provide a measurement of packet loss and packet latency on the tunnel. The Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device records the packet loss and latency statistics over a sliding window of time. BFD keeps track of the six most recent sliding windows of statistics, placing each set of statistics in a separate bucket.
If you configure an application-aware routing policy for the device, it is these statistics that the router uses to determine whether a data plane tunnel's performance matches the requirements of the policy's SLA.
This command can be used to display statistics about data plane traffic jitter, loss, and latency and other interface characteristics for all operational data plane tunnels on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
Example
The following example shows how to display statistics about data plane traffic jitter, loss, and latency and other interface characteristics for all operational data plane tunnels on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.

Command History
Release Modification
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Release 17.2.1v
This command is supported for Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN.
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10.1a
The command output shows BFD automatic suspension information.
Usage Guidelines
BFD provides rapid failure detection times between forwarding engines, while maintaining low overhead. If a BFD session is down, it implies that no traffic can flow between those TLOCs. If you identify any traffic disruption between a pair of TLOCs or notice that the session flap count has increased, use the show sdwan bfd history command to check the history of your BFD sessions.
Use this command to display Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN BFD history on Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices.
Example
The following example shows how to display Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN BFD history on Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices.

Note
Beginning with Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10.1a, a suspended flag, Sus, is added for identifying BFD sessions that are suspended for preventing flapping of BFD sessions.

Usage Guidelines
In the SD-WAN solution, we focus on building secure data plane connections, which involves onboarding physical or virtual WAN edge devices and establishing secure control connections across all the SD-WAN components in the network environment.
Secure onboarding of the SD-WAN edge physical or virtual device requires the device to be identified, trusted and allowed in the same overlay network.
Identity of the WAN edge device is uniquely identified by the chassis ID and certificate serial number. Depending on the WAN edge router, certificates are provided in different ways:
Hardware-based Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device certificate is stored in the on-board SUDI chip installed during manufacturing.
Virtual platform (Cisco CSR 1000v) which do not have root certificates preinstalled on the device. For these devices, a One-Time Token (OTK) is provided by Cisco SD-WAN Manager to authenticate the device with the SD-WAN controllers.
Trust of the WAN edge devices is done using the root chain certificates that are pre-loaded in manufacturing, loaded manually, distributed automatically by Cisco SD-WAN Manager, or installed during the Cisco Plug-and-Play automated deployment provisioning process.
The Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN solution uses a model, where the WAN edge devices that are allowed to join the SD-WAN overlay network need to be known by all the SD-WAN controllers beforehand. This is done by adding the WAN edge devices in the Plug-and-Play connect portal (PnP).
Use show sdwan certificate command to display information about the Cisco SD-WAN certificates on Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices to be used for Plug-and-Play, bootstrap or manual onboarding.
Example
The following example shows how to display the decoded certificate signing request installed on Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices.

Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco SD-WAN Manager CLI templates.
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.1a
Added the Hierarchical SD-WAN region assignment to the the REG IDs column when you use the local-properties keyword.
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.8.1a
For Hierarchical SD-WAN architectures, the REGION IDs column shows the secondary region also.
Usage Guidelines
In the Cisco SD-WAN overlay network, all Cisco XE SD-WAN devices and Cisco WAN Edge devices establish control connections to all Cisco SD-WAN Controllers, to ensure that the routers are always able to properly route data traffic across the network.
One way to manage network scale is to configure affinity between Cisco SD-WAN Controllers and WAN Edge routers. To do this, you place each Cisco SD-WAN Controller into a controller group, and then you configure which group or groups a WAN Edge router can establish control connections with.
The controller groups are what establishes the affinity between Cisco SD-WAN Controllers and WAN Edge routers.
The Cisco SD-WAN control plane operates in conjunction with redundant components to ensure that the overlay network remains resilient if one of the components fails.
This command can be used to display information about the control connections and control plane connections on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
Example
The following example shows how to display the configuration information about the control connections to one or more Cisco SD-WAN Controllers on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.

Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices can use the standards-based Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol when establishing IPsec tunnels between a device within the overlay network and a device that is external to the overlay network, such as a cloud-hosted service or a remote device.
IPsec provides confidentiality, data integrity, access control, and data source authentication for the traffic being exchanged over the IPsec tunnel.
This command can be used to display information about the IPsec tunnels to remote routers on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
Example
The following is a sample output of the show sdwan ipsec outbound-connections for Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a and later.
The following are sample outputs of the show sdwan ipsec outbound-connections command for releases prior to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a.

Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco SD-WAN Manager CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
On Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN devices, OMP advertises to its peers the routes and services that it has learned from its local site, along with their corresponding transport location mappings, which are called TLOCs.
OMP routes carry information that the device learns from the routing protocols running on its local network including routes learned from BGP and OSPF as well direct, connected, and static routes. This command can be used to display IPv6 OMP routes on Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices.
Example
The following example shows how to display IPv6 OMP routes on Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices.

Release Modification
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco SD-WAN Manager CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
Application-aware routing tracks network and path characteristics of the data plane tunnels between Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices, and uses the collected information to compute optimal paths for data traffic.
An application-aware routing policy matches applications with an SLA, that is, with the data plane tunnel performance characteristics that are necessary to transmit the applications' data traffic. When a data packet matches one of the match conditions, an SLA action is applied to the packet to determine the data plane tunnel to transmit the packet.
This command can be used to display information about application-aware routing policy matched packet counts on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
Example
The following example shows how to display information about application-aware routing policy matched packet counts on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
Device# show sdwan policy app-route-policy-filter
NAME               NAME     COUNTER NAME          PACKETS       BYTES

Command History
Release Modification
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco SD-WAN Manager CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
The QoS feature on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices works by examining packets entering at the edge of the network.
Generally, each router on the local service-side network examines the QoS settings of the packets that enter it, determines which class of packets are transmitted first, and processes the transmission based on those settings. As packets leave the network on the remote service-side network, you can rewrite the QoS bits of the packets before transmitting them to meet the policies of the targeted peer router.
You can configure and apply rewrite rules on the egress interface to overwrite the Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) value for packets entering the network.
This command can be used to display information about rewrite rules to interface bindings on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
Example
The following example shows how to display information about rewrite rules to interface bindings on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
Device# show sdwan policy rewrite-associations

Cisco IOS XE Release 17.8.1a
Added secondary-region to the output to show the Hierarchical SD-WAN region ID, and region to show the secondary region mode. Added transport-gateway to the output to indicate the enabled/disabled status. Added affinity-group and affinity-group preference to the output to indicate the affinity group ID assigned to the device and the preference order.
Usage Guidelines
Starting from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a, edge device accepts template push from Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1 with integrity-type configuration. The show sdwan running-config diff command fails if the template with integrity-type config is pushed from Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1 to older edge devices. Edge device needs to be upgraded to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a or higher version before receiving a template-push from Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1.

Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Release
17.2.1v
This command is supported in Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN.
Usage Guidelines
Secure SD-WAN brings key security capabilities embedded natively in SD-WAN solution with cloud-based single-pane of management for both SD-WAN and security capabilities. The security capabilities include enterprise firewall with application awareness, intrusion prevention systems with Cisco Talos signatures, URL-Filtering, and DNS/web-layer security.
The Enterprise Firewall with Application Awareness uses a flexible and easily understood zone-based model for traffic inspection.
A firewall policy is a type of localized security policy that allows stateful inspection of TCP, UDP, and ICMP data traffic flows. Traffic flows that originate in a given zone are allowed to proceed to another zone based on the policy between the two zones. A zone is a grouping of one or more VPNs. Grouping VPNs into zones allows you to establish security boundaries in your overlay network so that you can control all data traffic that passes between zones.
Firewall policies can match IP prefixes, IP ports, the protocols TCP, UDP, and ICMP, and applications. Matching flows for prefixes, ports, and protocols can be accepted or dropped, and the packet headers can be logged. Nonmatching flows are dropped by default. Matching applications are denied.
A zone pair is a container that associates a source zone with a destination zone and that applies a firewall policy to the traffic that flows between the two zones.
This command can be used to display the existing zone-based firewall sessions on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
Example
The following example shows how to display the existing zone-based firewall sessions on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.

Release Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.4.1a
This command was introduced.
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a
The output of this command was modified to include sub-service health for AppQoE using the keyword service-node-group .
Usage Guidelines
Starting from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a the output of the show service-insertion type appqoe service-node-group command shows the sub-service health for AppQoE. However, if the service node runs a version prior to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a, the sub-service health information is unavailable to the service controller. In such cases, the health markers for various AppQoE services show as green with 0% utilization even though not all services may be available to the service nodes.
The following is the sample output from show service-insertion type appqoe service-node-group command when the service nodes aren't upgraded to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a:

Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.1a
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
For usage guidelines, see the Cisco IOS XE show standby command.
The no standby or no standby version commands resets the version to 1. If standby IPv6 groups are present on the interface, then the no standby command is rejected because v6 groups are not supported with version 1.
You may also observe errors for the standby authentication command with version 1 because authentication isn't supported with the default version.
The following is a sample output from the show standby command:

The following table describes the significant fields shown in the output:
Table 43. show standby command Field Descriptions
Field
Description
Active router is
Value can be local, unknown, or an IP address. Address (and the expiration date of the address) of the current active hot standby router.
Active virtual MAC address
Virtual MAC address being used by the current active router.
Authentication
Authentication type configured based on the standby authentication command.
BFD enabled
Indicates that BFD peering is enabled on the router.
Ethernet - Group
Interface type and number and hot standby group number for the interface.
expires in
Time (in hours:minutes:seconds) in which the standby router will no longer be the standby router if the local router receives no hello packets from it.
Followed by groups:
Indicates the client HSRP groups that have been configured to follow this HSRP group.
Gratuitous ARP 14 sent, next in 7.412 secs
Number of the gratuitous ARP packet HSRP has sent and the time, in seconds, when HSRP sends the next gratuitous ARP packet. This output appears only when HSRP sends gratuitous ARP packets.
Group name is
Name of the HSRP group.
Hello time, hold time
Hello time is the time between hello packets, in seconds, based on the command. The holdtime is the time, in seconds, before other routers declare the active or standby router to be down, based on the standby timers command. All the routers in an HSRP group use the hello and hold- time values of the current active router. If the locally configured values are different, the variance appears in parentheses after the hello time and hold-time values.
key-string
Indicates that a key string is used for authentication. Configured key chains aren't displayed.
Local virtual MAC address
Virtual MAC address that will be used if this router became the active router. The origin of this address (displayed in parentheses) can be default, bia (burned-in address), or confgd (configured).
Next hello sent in
Time at which the Cisco IOS software sends the next hello packet (in hours:minutes:seconds).
P
Indicates that the router is configured to preempt.
Preemption enabled, sync delay
Indicates whether preemption is enabled or disabled. If enabled, the minimum delay is the time a higher-priority nonactive router waits before preempting the lower-priority active router. The sync delay is the maximum time a group waits for to synchronize with the IP redundancy clients.
Standby router is
Value can be local, unknown, or an IP address. IP address is the address (and the expiry date of the address) of the “standby” router (the router that is next in line to be the hot standby router).
State is
State of local router. Can be one of the following:
Active: Indicates the current hot standby router.
Standby: Indicates the router that is next in line to be the hot standby router.
Speak: Router is sending packets to claim the active or standby role.
Listen: Router is not in the active or standby state. However, if no messages are received from the active or standby router, it starts to speak.
Init or Disabled: Router isn't yet ready or able to participate in HSRP, possibly because the associated interface isn't up. HSRP groups configured on the other routers on the network, which are learned through snooping, are displayed as being in the initState. Locally configured groups with an interface that is down or groups without a specified interface IP address appear in the initState. For these cases, the Active address and Standby address fields show unknown. The state is listed as disabled in the fields when the standby ip command hasn't been specified.
Init (tracking shutdown): HSRP groups appear in the initState when HSRP group shutdown is configured and a tracked object goes down.
timeout
Duration (in seconds) for which HSRP accepts message digests based on both the old and new keys.
Tracking
Displays the list of interfaces that are being tracked and their corresponding states based on the configurations, using the standby track command.
Virtual IP address is, Secondary virtual IP addresses
All secondary virtual IP addresses are listed on separate lines. If one of the virtual IP addresses is a duplicate of an address configured for another device, it will be marked as duplicate. A duplicate address indicates that the router has failed to defend its Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache entry.
