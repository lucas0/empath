Feature Description
Systems and Interfaces
Support for Dialer Interface in DSL
This feature enables tracking of a Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) session over a dialer interface on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
Dialer interface is used in Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) in the deployments of Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE), Point-to-Point Protocol over Asynchronous Transfer Mode (PPPoA). Dialer interface always stay up irrespective of the PPP session status. This helps to avoid the need for additional configuration such as IP SLA and tracking for routing failover to work while using dialer interfaces.
The command dialer down-with-vInterface is added to bring down the dialer interface when the PPP session goes down.
Routing
OSPFv3 Support on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices
Open Shortest Path First version 3 (OSPFv3) is an IPv4 and IPv6 link-state routing protocol that supports IPv6 and IPv4 unicast address families.
Multicast over L3 TLOC Extension
This feature enables support for transport location (TLOC) which allows addition of the peers transport to avoid the extra cost of additional IP and allows the use of dynamic load balance across multiple transports.
Cloud OnRamp
Transit Gateway Peering
This feature enables the ability to establish peer connections between transit gateways in different AWS regions. With this feature, you can connect to various Transit Virtual Private Clouds (TVPCs) and on-premise networks using a single gateway. The ability to peer transit gateways between different AWS regions enables you to extend the connectivity and build global networks spanning multiple other regions. To support inter-region connectivity, mapping and audit functions are enhanced.
Policies
NAT Fallback on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices support the NAT fallback feature for Direct Internet Access (DIA). The NAT fallback feature provides a routing-based mechanism for all traffic that is sent to the DIA route to use an alternative route when required. With this release, fallback is supported on the service and tunnel side.

Cisco vManage Cluster Upgrade
This feature outlines the upgrade procedure for Cisco vManage servers in a cluster to Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1.
Systems and Interfaces
Configure a Router as an NTP Primary
This feature lets you configure a supported router as an NTP primary router. Other nodes in a Cisco SD-WAN deployment synchronize their clocks to the NTP primary router. This configuration is useful if you do not have an NTP server in your deployment.
Export vManage Audit Log as Syslog
The Cisco vManage NMS exports audit logs in syslog message format to a configured external syslog server. This feature allows you to consolidate and store network activity logs in a central location.
Hardened Passwords
This feature enables password policy rules in Cisco vManage. Once enabled, Cisco vManage enforces the use of strong passwords.
Configure Sessions in Cisco vManage
This feature lets you see all HTTP sessions open within Cisco vManage. It gives you details about the username, source IP address, domain of the user, and other information. A user with User Management Write access, or a netadmin user can trigger a log out of any suspicious user's session.
You can set client session timeouts, session lifetimes, server session timeouts, and enable the maximum number of user sessions in Cisco vManage.
Posture Assessment Support
Identity Services Engine (ISE) Posture functions are intergrated into Cisco 1100 Integrated Services Routers. This feature enables you to utilize Posture Assessment capabilities to validate the compliance of endpoints according to security policies of your enterprise.
For Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1 this feature can only be configured using CLI Add-On feature templates in Cisco vManage.
Remove Certificate SUDI requirement.
This feature allows you to use a subject SUDI serial number instead of a certificate serial number to add a device to a Cisco SD-WAN overlay network.
Integration with Cisco Unified Communications
This release adds support for using a feature template to enable Cisco IP-based media services.
Dynamic On-Demand Tunnels
This feature enables you to configure an Inactive state for tunnels between edge devices, reducing performance demands on devices and reducing network traffic.
Static Route Tracker for Service VPNs
This feature enables you to configure IPv4 static route endpoint tracking for service VPNs.
For static routes, endpoint tracking determines whether the configured endpoint is reachable before adding that route to the route table of the device.
To configure Static Route Tracking on Cisco vManage, configure an endpoint tracker using Cisco System template, and Configure a static route using the Cisco VPN template.
NAT DIA Tracker for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices
This feature allows you to configure a system tracker to probe the transport interface periodically to determine if the Internet or external network becomes unavailable.
You can configure DIA Tracker using the Tracker tab of the Cisco System template.
You can apply the tracker to a transport interface using either Cisco VPN Interface Ethernet or Cisco VPN Interface Cellular templates.
Service Side NAT on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices
This feature allows you to configure inside and outside NAT on data traffic traveling to and from the service-side hosts of the network overlay.
The service-side NAT configuration allows you to translate the source IP addresses for data traffic from service- side hosts to the overlay and traffic from the overlay to service-side hosts.
To configure service-side NAT using Cisco vManage, configure a centralized data policy using the Configure > Policies, and configure a dynamic NAT Pool and Static NAT address using the Service VPN template.
Qualified Commands for Cisco IOS XE Release Amsterdam 17.3.1a
Starting Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.1a, you can use additional commands in CLI Add-on feature templates.
Routing
BGP Community Propagation
This feature enables propagation of BGP communities between routing protocols during route redistribution. One one node, the OMP redistributes routes from BGP and on the other node, the OMP redistributes node into BGP. The BGP AS Path is propagated over OMP so that it can be preserved between Cisco SD-WAN nodes. The BGP community propagation helps in propagating BGP communities between Cisco SD-WAN sites, across VPNs using OMP redistribution.
OMP Route Aggregation
This feature is an enhancement where OMP route aggregation is performed only for the routes that are configured for route redistribution to avoid black hole routing. This enhancement is applicable for OSPF, Connected, Static, BGP and other protocols only if the redestribution is requested.
Route Leaking Between Global VRF and Service VPNs
This feature enables you to leak routes bidirectionally between the global VRF and service VPNs. Route leaking allows service sharing and is beneficial in migration use cases because it allows bypassing hubs and provides migrated branches direct access to non-migrated branches.
BFD for Routing Protocols in Cisco SD-WAN
This feature extends BFD support to BGP, OSPF, and EIGRP protocols in the Cisco SD-WAN solution. BFD provides a consistent failure detection method to detect forwarding path failures at a uniform rate, therefore enabling faster reconvergence time.
Forwarding and QoS
Adaptive QoS
This feature enables WAN interface shapers and per-tunnel shapers at the enterprise edge to adapt to the available WAN bandwidth. The capability to adapt to the bandwidth controls differentiated packet drops at the enterprise edge and reduces or prevents packet drops in the network core.
Policies
Application-Aware Routing Policy Support for Multicast
This feature enables support for configuring application-aware routing policy for multicast traffic on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices based on source and destination, protocol matching and SLA requirement.
Support for six SLA Classes per Policy
This feature allows you to configure up to six SLA classes per policy on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. This allows additional options to be configured in an application-aware routing policy.
Support for Defining Custom Applications
This feature adds support for defining custom applications.
Service insertion tracker support
This feature extends support for service chaining to Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. On Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices and Cisco vEdge devices, it adds a tracking feature that logs the availability of a service.
Security
Support for SGT Propagation with Cisco TrustSec Integration
This feature enables Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN edge devices to propagate Security Group Tag (SGT) inline tags that are generated by Cisco TrustSec-enabled switches in the branches to other edge devices in the Cisco SD-WAN network. While Cisco TrustSec-enabled switches does classification, propagation (inline SGT tagging) and enforcement on the branches, Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices carry the inline tags across the edge devices.
Cloud OnRamp
Support for Specifying Office 365 Traffic Categories for Cloud onRamp for SaaS on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices
This feature updates the existing Cloud onRamp for SaaS configuration workflow for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. The feature allows you to limit the use of best path selection to some or all Office 365 traffic, according to the Office 365 traffic categories defined by Microsoft.
Integration of AWS Branch with Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices
Cisco SD-WAN Cloud OnRamp for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) extends enterprise WAN to public clouds. This multi-cloud solution helps to integrate public cloud infrastructure into Cisco SD-WAN fabric. This feature enables Transit Gateway (TGW) when the standard Cloud OnRamp solution is not sufficient. For example, one host VPC is connected to the Cisco SD-WAN edge router using an Internet Gateway (IGW). If the IGW bandwidth limit is less, then TGW is used for SD-WAN integration. TGW provides a way to interconnect VPCs and VPNs.
Support Catalyst 48Y4C (Cloud OnRamp for Colocation)
This release supports the use of Cisco Catalyst 9500-48Y4C switches in the Cloud onRamp for colocation cluster that enables 80G-200G of bidirectional throughput.
Flexible Topologies (Cloud OnRamp for Colocation)
This feature provides the ability to flexibly insert the NIC cards and interconnect the devices (CSP devices and Catalyst 9500 switches) within the Cloud onRamp for colocation cluster. Any CSP ports can be connected to any port on the switches. The Stackwise Virtual Switch Link (SVL) ports can be connected to any port and similarly the uplink ports can be connected to any port on the switches.
TACACS Authentication (Cloud OnRamp for Colocation)
This feature allows you to configure the TACACS authentication for users accessing the Cisco CSP and Cisco Catalyst 9500 devices. Authenticating the users using TACACS validates and secures their access to the Cisco CSP and Cisco Catalyst 9500 devices.
Network Assurance –VNFs: Stop/Start/Restart (Cloud OnRamp for Colocation)
This feature provides the capability to stop, start, or restart VNFs on Cisco CSP devices from the Colocation Clusters tab. You can easily perform the operations on VNFs using Cisco vManage.
TCP Optimization
TCP Optimization
TCP optimization support extended to Cisco ISR4221, Cisco ISRv, and Cisco 1000 Series Integrated Services Routers. See Supported Platforms for more information.
Monitor and Maintain
Embedded Packet Capture
This feature is an onboard packet capture facility that allows network administrators to capture packets flowing to, through, and from the device and to analyze them locally or save and export them for offline analysis through Cisco vManage. This feature facilitates application analysis, security, and troubleshooting by gathering information about the packet format.
TAC Access
TAC Access to Cisco vManage
When working with the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to address an issue in Cisco vManage, users may provide TAC with access to Cisco vManage or TAC teams may access Cisco vManage using the consent token mechanism. In the past, this access has relied on a user account called viptelatac. In this release, two separate user accounts have been added, one with read-only access and one with write access. The accounts use a challenge-response authentication method.
Cisco SD-WAN for Government
Cisco SD-WAN for Government
FedRAMP, the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, is a United States-government program that provides a specific set of standards to ensure that a cloud provider meets the requirements to be eligible for use by the U.S. federal government. With Cisco SD-WAN for Government, you can quickly and easily deploy a Cisco SD-WAN overlay network using the Cisco Self-Service Portal. This ensures that your Cisco SD-WAN network meets the stringent requirements of FedRAMP with enhanced security and rapid deployments.

Important Notes, Known Behavior, and Workaround
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices with the SFP-10G-SR module do not support online insertion and removal (OIR) of this module.
When you complete a Cisco SD-WAN software downgrade procedure on a device, the device goes into the configuration mode that it was in when you last upgraded the Cisco SD-WAN software on the device. If the device is in a different configuration mode when you start the downgrade than it was when you last upgraded, the device and Cisco vManage show different configuration modes after the downgrade completes. To put the configuration modes back in sync, reattach the device to a device template. After you reattach the device, both the device and Cisco vManage show that the device is in the vManage configuration mode.
Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1 implements a hardened security posture to comply with FedRamp guidelines. As a result, your vAnalytics login credentials that are stored locally get erased on upgrading the software, and you cannot access the vAnalytics service directly through Cisco vManage. In this case, log in to vAnalytics using this URL: https://analytics.viptela.com. If you can’t find your vAnalytics login credentials, open a case with Cisco TAC support.
