How do I generate a new local certificate for a TelePresence Server?
An example of the OpenSSL commands used to generate a new local certificate is shown here.
Note: This will not necessarily work on all systems.
openssl genrsa -out key.pem 4096
openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha1 -days 1825 -key key.pem -out
 certificate.pem
You must then supply the requested details at the prompts. This generates a self-signed certificate, valid for five years, with the details provided. Refer to the certificate authorities for more details on how to generate certificates.
