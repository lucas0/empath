New Features do not Apply to Cisco VCS
New features from software version X12.5 and later are not supported for the Cisco VCS, and apply only to the Cisco Expressway Series. For Cisco VCS systems, this version is provided for maintenance and bug fixing purposes only, which includes support for any security enhancements, alarm-based email notifications, and option key changes.
Features and Changes in X14.0
Security Enhancements
Various security-related improvements apply in this release as part of ongoing security enhancements. Much of this is behind the scenes, but some changes affect the user interfaces or configuration:
Admins now have the flexibility to configure SSH ciphers on TCP port 22 which is configurable from the web interface, without needing to use CLI commands to update the Expressway SSH configuration.
To meet Cisco Product Security Baseline, the cipher filters for the following services are updated:
SSL ciphers used by Reverse proxy
SSL ciphers used by Apache
SSL ciphers used by UC Service Discovery
SSL ciphers used by XMPP
SSL ciphers for LDAP
To meet Cisco Product Security Baseline, the crypto algorithms of the SSH Key Configuration are updated. Some disallowed key exchange algorithms are removed:
ecdh-sha2-nistp521
ecdh-sha2-nistp384
The following key exchange algorithms are added:
ecdh-sha2-nistp256
diffie-hellman-group14-sha256
diffie-hellman-group14-sh1
Expressway-E is exposed to silent SIP scans (using SIP OPTIONS) and spam calls (using SIP INVITE). This is similar to a DoS attack. To protect from this SIP based DOS attack, SIP Authentication Failure on Fail2Ban is enabled for:
Fresh Expressway installations from X14.0 and later versions
Factory reset with X14.0 or later versions
From X14.0 release, you can configure the Rate Limits for SIP transaction. From the Web UI, you can enable/disable or change number of connections per second and Burst limit values. By default, the connections per second values is 100 and the Burst limit is 20.
From X14.0 release, Automated Protection or the SIP Registration failure detection system is now enhanced to cover the following conditions:
License limit exceeded
Maintenance mode
Not permitted by policy
Out of resource
Registration not allowed
From X14.0 release, when an Expressway VM is running on sub-spec hardware with a slow CPU and low memory, an unsupported/non-compliant hardware warning alarm is displayed.
From X14.0 release, as part of the enhancements to CUCM/Phone security feature support over MRA, port 6971 is added on the HTTPS allow list for OAuth enabled MRA client to download the configuration file.
From X14.0.1 and later release, multiple Admin Accounts and Groups can have CLI access. For more information, see About the administrator account and field references.
From X14.0.1 release, two new alarms have been introduced in the trust store and onboarding trust store to notify the administrator
Alarm to indicate that certificate is going to expire in next 21 days
Alarm to indicate that certificates have expired
Redirect URI Support
Webex Client Embedded Browser Support
From X14.0 release, Expressway has a toggle to enable/disable the SSO Redirect URI for Webex feature. This feature enhances the security of Cisco Jabber/Webex Client embedded browser support with following benefits:
Provides protection against "Authorization Code Interception Attack" using RFC7636.
Allows clients running on an Operating Systems other than iOS, to use the Embedded Browser (For example: Android).
Allows Jabber and Webex client to use the Embedded browser for Unified Communications Manager (and MRA) OAuth flow.
Improves the user experience when using Webex client and Unified Communications Manager Calling.
For more information, refer to Mobile and Remote Access Through Cisco Expressway Deployement Guide.
AV1 Support
From X14.0 release, Expressway supports the negotiation and passthrough of AV1 codecs to establish media. The codecs are supported in SIP traversal calls (that is, calls where the Expressway is handling the media streams).
Escalation from P2P to Meeting
As a Webex user, while in a 1:1 SIP call - you now have the ability to call a Webex meeting and invoke meeting features such as:
Add video participants
Use Webex Assistant
Use whiteboard
During the escalation process, you will have the option to invite additional participants or simply transition the 1:1 call to a 1:1 meeting. It also gives you the option to keep the existing audio channel (mobile or desk phone) while augmenting video and share via separate data channel.
Expressway Cluster Load Balancing Not Applicable to SIP Federation
In an Expressway deployment used for SIP Federation, there is always a high load of SIP volume on the Expressway and multiple peers are needed to handle the SIP Volume. Expressway was unable to distribute this traffic equally across the Expressway Edge traversal Servers.
From X14.0 release, Expressway can load balance the traffic correctly across Traversal Zone connections.
XCP Support for Jabber Zero Downtime
From X14.0 release, Expressway supports dual connection with Jabber clients. When enabled on the client side, this type of connection ensures zero service downtime during High Availability failover events.
It helps to:
Minimize service disruption to Jabber clients during upgrade.
Provide seamless transition of the user session between the primary and the secondary node.
SIP Registration Failover for Cisco Jabber - MRA Deployments
This feature applies if you deploy Expressway with Mobile and Remote Access (MRA).
Expressway X14.0 builds on existing failover capabilities for clustered Expressways with a number of MRA failover updates that improve substantially the failover time for Cisco Jabber clients that connect over MRA. Among the updates include adaptive routing, STUN keepalive support, and improved error reporting.
These new capabilities allow Jabber clients to support MRA High Availability (failover) for voice and video.
For more information, refer to Mobile and Remote Access Through Cisco Expressway Deployement Guide.
(Preview) Hardware Security Module (HSM) Support
Expressway has supported HSM functionality, on a Preview basis only, from X12.6.
HSM safeguards and manages digital keys for strong authentication, and provides crypto-processing for critical functions such as encryption, decryption and authentication for the use of applications, identities, and databases. An HSM device comes as a plug-in card or an external device that attaches directly to your computer or network server. It prevents hardware and software tampering - by raising alarms or by making the HSM inoperable.
A new Maintenance > Security > HSM configuration page is added to the Expressway web user interface.
Expressway currently supports the nShield Connect XC from Entrust as an HSM provider (on a Preview basis).

Important
The "SafeNet Luna" network device from Gemalto is also referenced in the Expressway user interface but this device is not currently supported by Expressway.
(Preview) Headset Capabilities for Cisco Contact Center - MRA Deployments
This feature applies if you deploy Expressway with MRA. It is currently provided in Preview status only.
New demonstration software now provides some Cisco Contact Center functions on compatible Cisco headsets. From X12.6, Expressway automatically supports these new headset capabilities as a preview feature, if the involved endpoint, headset, and Unified CM are running the necessary software versions. The feature is enabled from the Unified CM interface and you don't need to configure anything on Expressway.
More information is available in the white paper Cisco Headset and Finesse Integration for Contact Center at https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/whitePaper/CUCM_Headsets_for_ContactCenter_WP.pdf
(Preview) Push Notifications with Mobile Application Management clients- MRA Deployments
This feature applies if you deploy Expressway with MRA. It is currently provided in Preview status only.
With this feature, push notification support over MRA now includes support for Mobile Application Management (MAM) clients like Jabberintune and Jabberblackberry. As a result, the push notification service is available for all devices that are running Jabberintune and Jabberblackberry clients.
(Preview) Push Notifications with Android Devices - MRA Deployments
This feature applies if you deploy Expressway with MRA. In X12.6 it was introduced in Preview status only, due to external product version dependencies.
In X12.6.2, the feature was switched off by default due to a known issue (bug ID CSCvv12541 refers).
In X12.7, bug ID CSCvv12541 is fixed. However this feature remains in Preview status for now, due to pending software dependencies.
How to enable push notifications for Android devices
This feature is enabled through the Expressway command line interface. Only do this if all IM and Presence Service nodes that service Android users are also running a supported release.
The CLI command is: xConfiguration XCP Config FcmService: On

Note
IM and Presence services for users who are currently signed in over MRA will be disrupted when this command is used, so those users will need to sign in again.
(Preview) KEM Support for Compatible Phones - MRA Deployments
We have not officially tested and verified support over MRA for the Key Expansion Module (KEM) accessory for Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series devices. However, we have observed under lab conditions that KEMs with multiple DNs work satisfactorily over MRA. These are not official tests, but in view of the COVID-19 crisis, this may be useful information for customers who are willing to use an unsupported preview feature.
SIP path headers must be enabled on Expressway, and you need a Unified CM software version that supports path headers (release 11.5(1)SU4 or later is recommended).
Ongoing Removal of Unsupported Functions from UI
To enhance usability and consistency we are removing discontinued functions and features from the user interface. Details per release are in Withdrawn or Deprecated Features and Software.
There are no changes in this respect for the X14.0 release.
Other Changes in this Release
The Connection Manager log has been improved.
REST API Changes
The REST API for Expressway is available to simplify remote configuration. For example by third party systems such as Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning. We add REST API access to configuration, commands, and status information as new features are added, and also selectively retrofit the REST API to some features that were added in earlier versions of Expressway.
The API is self-documented using RAML, and you can access the RAML definitions at https://<ip address>/api/raml. A high-level summary of how to access and use the API is provided in the Cisco Expressway REST API Summary Guide on the Expressway Installation Guides page.

Issues resolved by X14.0
Notable Issues in this Version
Rich Media Session license is not consumed by Single NIC Cisco VCS Expressway hosting Jabber Guest service
CSCva36208
Changes to the licensing model in X8.8 revealed an issue with licensing of the Jabber Guest service on the Cisco VCS Expressway server. When the Cisco VCS pair is part of the "Single NIC" Jabber Guest deployment, the Cisco VCS Expressway should count one RMS license for each Jabber Guest call, but it does not. This issue may cause confusion about the server's load, because usage appears low even when the server is processing multiple calls.

Note
We recommend the Dual NIC Jabber Guest deployment. If you are using the single NIC deployment, make sure the Cisco VCS Expressway is correctly licensed to ensure continuity of service with future upgrades.
Limitations
Some Cisco VCS Features are Preview or Have External Dependencies
We aim to provide new Cisco VCS features as speedily as possible. Sometimes it is not possible to officially support a new feature because it may require updates to other Cisco products which are not yet available, or known issues or limitations affect some deployments of the feature. If customers might still benefit from using the feature, we mark it as "preview" in the release notes. Preview features may be used, but you should not rely on them in production environments. Occasionally we may recommend that a feature is not used until further updates are made to Expressway or other products. Cisco VCS features which are provided in preview status only in this release, are listed in the "Feature History table" earlier in these notes.
Unsupported Functionality
Currently, if one Cisco VCS node in a clustered deployment fails or loses network connectivity for any reason, or if the Unified CM restarts, all active calls going through the affected node will fail. The calls are not handed over to another cluster peer. This is not new behavior in X12.5.x, but due to an oversight it was not documented in previous releases. Bug ID CSCtr39974 refers.
Cisco VCS does not terminate DTLS. We do not support DTLS for securing media and SRTP is used to secure calls. Attempts to make DTLS calls through Cisco VCS will fail. The DTLS protocol is inserted in the SDP but only for traversing the encrypted iX protocol.
From X12.5, Expressway provides limited SIP UPDATE support over MRA connections for session refresh purposes only, as specified by RFC 4028. However, you should not switch this on unless you have a specific requirement to use this capability. Any other use of SIP UPDATE is not supported and features that rely on this method will not work as expected.
Cisco VCS does not support the SIP UPDATE method (RFC 3311), and features that rely on this method will not work as expected.
Audio calls may be licensed as video calls in some circumstances. Calls that are strictly audio-ONLY consume fewer licenses than video calls. However, when audio calls include non-audio channels, such as the iX channel that enables ActiveControl, they are treated as video calls for licensing purposes.
Cisco VCS TURN does Not Operate as a STUN Server
From X12.6.1, due to security enhancements, the Cisco VCS Expressway TURN server no longer functions as a generic STUN server and will not accept unauthenticated STUN binding requests.
This leads to the following scenarios:
Scenario A: If you use the B2BUA as a TURN client for Microsoft interoperability (as described in the Cisco Expressway with Microsoft Infrastructure Deployment Guide) the B2BUA will not send any STUN binding requests to the TURN server to check if it is alive or not. This means that from Cisco VCS X12.6.1, the B2BUA may try to use a TURN server that is not reachable and hence that calls may fail.
Scenario B: If you use Meeting Server WebRTC with Expressway (and Expressway-E is configured as a TURN server) before you install Cisco VCS X12.6.1 or later, first upgrade the Meeting Server software to version 3.0 or to a compatible maintenance release in version 2.9.x or 2.8.x. Bug ID CSCvv01243 refers. This requirement is because other Meeting Server versions use STUN bind requests towards the TURN server on Cisco VCS Expressway (For more information about Cisco VCS Expressway TURN server configuration, see the Cisco Expressway Web Proxy for Cisco Meeting Server Deployment Guide.).
Cisco Webex Hybrid Call Service
Expressway X12.6 and later does not work for hosting the Call Connector software that is required in a Hybrid Call Service deployment and you need to use an earlier supported version for the Expressway connector host. See the Hybrid Call Service known issues and Expressway version support documentation on https://help.webex.com/ for more information.
Product License Registration - Issue with Converting to Smart Licensing
This item applies if you want to convert existing Expressway licenses (RMS, Desktop, or Room) to Smart Licensing entitlements. In this case do not use the option in the Cisco Product License Registration portal to partially convert just some of the licenses. Due to a known issue, if you opt to convert only some licenses, the system automatically forfeits/removes the remaining licenses as well. So the licenses that are not converted are also removed, and a licensing case will be required to retrieve them.
To avoid this happening, please ensure that the Quantity to Convert field is the same value as the Quantity Available field; this is the default when you open the page.
Static NAT for Clustered Systems
From X12.5.5, support for static NAT functionality on TURN is extended to clustered systems (support for standalone systems was introduced in X12.5.3). However, peers which are configured as TURN servers must be reachable using the private addresses for their corresponding public interfaces.
MRA Limitations
If you use Cisco VCS for Mobile and Remote Access (MRA), some unsupported features and limitations currently exist. A list of key unsupported features that we know do not work with MRA is detailed in Key Supported and Unsupported Features with Mobile and Remote Access in the Mobile and Remote Access Through Cisco Expressway Guide.
For details of which 7800/8800 Series phones and other endpoints support MRA, see the MRA Requirements section of the Mobile and Remote Access Through Cisco Expressway Guide.
1. SIP UPDATE for session refresh support over MRA has some limitations. For example, the following features that rely on the SIP UPDATE method (RFC 3311) will fail:
Request to display the security icon on MRA endpoints for end-to-end secure calls.
Request to change the caller ID to display name or number on MRA endpoints.
2. Unity Voicemail over Mobile and Remote Access (MRA) does not work with X14.0 release. This issue will be fixed in our future release(bug ID CSCvy29217 refers.

Note
Do not upgrade if the Unity Voicemail feature is sufficiently significant.
MRA IM&P Dual Connection (MRA HA) - Do Not Use
Expressway X12.7 can support IM&P dual connection mode. However, please do not use this feature as it is not yet implemented throughout the wider solution.
MRA OAuth Token Authorization with Endpoints / Clients
In standard MRA mode (no ICE) regardless of any MRA access policy settings configured on Unified CM, Cisco Jabber users will be able to authenticate by username and password or by traditional single sign-on in the following case:
You have Jabber users running versions before 11.9 (no refresh token support) and Cisco VCS is configured to allow non-token authentication.
In ICE passthrough mode, the ICE MRA call path must be encrypted end-to-end (see Signaling Path Encryption Between Expressway-C and Unified CM in the Expressway MRA Deployment Guide). Typically for end-to-end encryption, Unified CM must be in mixed mode for physical endpoints. For Jabber clients however, you can achieve the end-to-end encryption requirement by leveraging SIP OAuth with Unified CM clusters that are not in mixed mode.

Note
You must enable SIP OAuth if the Unified CM is not in mixed mode, but SIP OAuth is not required for Jabber if you're able to register using standard secure profiles.
More information is in the Configure MRA Access Control section of the Expressway MRA Deployment Guide and in the Deploying OAuth with Cisco Collaboration Solution Release 12.0 White Paper.
Spurious Alarms when Adding or Removing Peers in a Cluster
When a new peer is added to a cluster, the system may raise multiple 20021 Alarms (Cluster communication failure: Unable to establish...) even if the cluster is in fact correctly formed. The alarms appear on the existing peers in the cluster. The unnecessary alarms are typically lowered after at least 5 minutes elapses from the time that the new peer is successfully added.
These alarms also occur if a peer is removed from a cluster. This is generally valid alarm behavior in the case of removing a peer. However, as in the case of adding a peer, the alarms may not be lowered for 5 minutes or more.
Virtual Systems
This issue applies to Cisco VCSs running as virtualized systems with certain ESXi versions using VMWare vCenter 7.0.x. It was found during testing using VMWare vCenter 7.0.1 with ESXi 6.7.0 to deploy a VCS OVA. The Ready to complete final page of the Deploy OVF Template wizard displays template values instead of the actual values entered on the earlier wizard pages. The issue is cosmetic, and when you click "FINISH" the OVA will deploy as expected using the entered values. Bug ID CSCvw64883 refers.
Video calling capacity may be restricted if the ESXi Side-Channel-Aware Scheduler is enabled, and CPU load exceeds 70%.
With physical Cisco VCS appliances, the Advanced Networking feature allows the speed and duplex mode to be set for each configured Ethernet port. You cannot set port speeds for virtual machine-based Cisco VCS systems.
Also, virtual machine-based systems always show the connection speed between Cisco VCS and Ethernet networks as 10000 Mb/s, regardless of the actual physical NIC speed. This is due to a limitation in virtual machines, which cannot retrieve the actual speed from the physical NIC(s).
Medium Appliances with 1 Gbps NIC - Demultiplexing Ports
If you upgrade a Medium appliance with a 1 Gbps NIC to X8.10 or later, Cisco VCS automatically converts the system to a Large system. This means that Cisco VCS Expressway listens for multiplexed RTP/RTCP traffic on the default demultiplexing ports for Large systems (36000 to 36011) and not on the demultiplexing ports configured for Medium systems. In this case, the Cisco VCS Expressway drops the calls because ports 36000 to 36011 are not open on the firewall.
Workaround
From X8.11.4 you can manually change the system size back to Medium, through the System > Administration settings page (select Medium from the Deployment Configuration list).
Before X8.11.4, the workaround is to open the default demultiplexing ports for Large systems on the firewall.
Language Packs
If you translate the Cisco VCS web user interface, new Cisco VCS language packs are available from X8.10.3. Older language packs do not work with X8.10.n software (or X8.9.n). Instructions for installing or updating the packs are in the Cisco VCS Administrator Guide.
XMPP Federation-Behavior on IM&P Node Failure
If you use XMPP external federation, be aware that if an IM and Presence Service node fails over to a different node after an outage, the affected users are not dynamically moved to the other node. Cisco VCS does not support this functionality, and it has not been tested.
Cisco Webex Calling May Fail with Dual-NIC Cisco VCS
This issue applies if you deploy Cisco VCS with a dual-NIC Cisco VCS Expressway. Cisco Webex Calling requests may fail if the same (overlapping) static route applies to both the external interface and the interface with the Cisco VCS Control. This is due to current Cisco VCS Expressway routing behavior, which treats Webex INVITES as non-NAT and therefore extracts the source address directly from the SIP Via header.

Note
We recommend that you make static routes as specific as possible, to minimize the risk of the routes overlapping, and this issue occurring.
Microsoft Federation with Dual Homed Conferencing-SIP Message Size
If you use dual homed conferencing through Cisco VCS and Meeting Server with an AVMCU invoked on the Microsoft side, the maximum SIP message size must be set to 32768 bytes (the default) or greater. It's likely that you will need a greater value for larger conferences (that is, from around nine or more participants upwards). Defined via SIP max size on Configuration > Protocols > SIP.
Intradomain Microsoft Interop with Expressway and Cisco Meeting Server
If you use Meeting Server for Microsoft interoperability, a limitation currently applies to the following intradomain/intracompany scenario:
You deploy separate Microsoft and standards-based SIP networks in a single domain and in a configuration that has an Cisco VCS Expressway directly facing a Microsoft front end server (because you use internal firewalls between subnetworks, or for any other reason). For example, Cisco Unified Call Manager in one (sub)network and Microsoft in a second (sub)network, inside the same domain.
In this case we do not generally support Microsoft interoperability between the two networks, and calls between Meeting Server and Microsoft will be rejected.
Workaround
If you are not able to deploy the intradomain networks without an intervening VCS Expressway (you cannot configure Meeting Server <> VCS Control <> Microsoft), a workaround is to deploy an VCS-C in each subnet, with an VCS-E to traverse between them. That is:
Meeting Server <> VCS Control <> Firewall <> VCS Expressway <> Firewall <> VCS Control <> Microsoft
Option Keys Only Take Effect for 65 Keys or Fewer
If you try to add more than 65 option keys (licenses), they appear as normal in the Cisco VCS web interface (Maintenance > Option keys). However, only the first 65 keys take effect. Additional keys from 66 onwards appear to be added, but actually the Cisco VCS does not process them. Bug ID CSCvf78728 refers.
Using Collaboration Solutions Analyzer
The Collaboration Solutions Analyzer is created by Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to help you with validating your deployment, and to assist with troubleshooting by analyzing Cisco VCS log files. For example, you can use the Business to Business Call Tester to validate and test calls, including Microsoft interworked calls.
You need a customer or partner account to use the Collaboration Solutions Analyzer.
Getting Started
Procedure
Step 1
If you plan to use the log analysis tool, first collect the Cisco VCS logs.
Step 2
Sign in to https://cway.cisco.com/tools/CollaborationSolutionsAnalyzer/
From X12.6 you can use the Analyze log button on the Diagnostic logging page (Maintenance > Diagnostics) to open a link to the Collaboration Solutions Analyzer troubleshooting tool.
Step 3
Click the tool you want to use. For example, to work with logs:
Click Log analysis.
Upload the log file(s).
Select the files you want to analyze.
Click Run Analysis.
The tool analyzes the log files and displays the information in a format which is much easier to understand than the raw logs. For example, you can generate ladder diagrams to show SIP calls.

Appendix: Post-Upgrade Tasks for MRA Deployments
This section only applies if you use the Cisco VCS for Mobile and Remote Access and you upgrade from X8.9.x or earlier to X8.10 or later.
To reconfigure the MRA access control settings

Important
The Check for internal authentication availability setting will be off after the upgrade. Depending on the authentication settings on the Unified CM, this may prevent remote login by some Cisco Jabber users.
The Exclusive option in X8.9 is now configured by setting Authentication path to SAML SSO authentication. This has the effect of prohibiting authentication by username and password.
Before you begin
After the system restarts you need to reconfigure the MRA access control settings.
Procedure
Step 1
On the Cisco VCS Control, go to Configuration > Unified Communications > Configuration > MRA Access Control.
Step 2
Do one of the following:
To take advantage of the new MRA access control methods from X8.10, set the appropriate values on this page for your chosen methods. See the first table below for help about which values to apply.
Or to retain your pre-upgrade authentication approach, set the appropriate values on this page to match your previous settings on the Cisco VCS Expressway. See the second table below for help about how to map the old Cisco VCS Expressway settings to their new equivalents on the Cisco VCS Control.
Step 3
If you configure self-describing tokens (Authorize by OAuth token with refresh), refresh the Unified CM nodes: Go to Configuration > Unified Communications > <UC server type> and click Refresh servers.
Settings for MRA access control
The fields you actually see in the Web UI depend on whether MRA is enabled (Unified Communications mode set to Mobile and remote access) and on the selected authentication path. Not all the fields in the table are necessarily displayed.
Table 5. Settings for MRA access control
Field
Description
Default
Authentication path
Hidden field until MRA is enabled. Defines how MRA authentication is controlled.
SAML SSO authentication: Clients are authenticated by an external IdP.
UCM/LDAP basic authentication: Clients are authenticated locally by the Unified CM against their LDAP credentials.
SAML SSO and UCM/LDAP: Allows either method.
None: No authentication is applied. This is the default setting until MRA is first enabled. The "None" option is needed (rather than just leaving MRA turned off) because some deployments must turn on MRA to allow functions which are not actually MRA. (Such as the Web Proxy for Meeting Server, or XMPP Federation.) Only these customers should use "None".
Note 
Do not use it in other cases.
None before MRA turned on
UCM/LDAP after MRA turned on
Authorize by OAuth token with refresh
This option requires self-describing tokens for authorization. It's our recommended authorization option for all deployments that have the infrastructure to support them.
Only Jabber clients are currently capable of using this authorization method. Other MRA endpoints do not currently support it. The clients must also be in OAuth token with refresh authorization mode.
On
Authorize by OAuth token (previously SSO Mode)
Available if Authentication path is SAML SSO or SAML SSO and UCM/LDAP.
This option requires authentication through the IdP. Currently, only Jabber clients are capable of using this authorization method, which is not supported by other MRA endpoints.
Off
Authorize by user credentials
Available if Authentication path is UCM/LDAP or SAML SSO and UCM/LDAP.
Clients attempting to perform authentication by user credentials are allowed through MRA. This includes Jabber, and supported IP phone and TelePresence devices.
Off
Check for internal authentication availability
Available if Authorize by OAuth token with refresh or Authorize by OAuth token is enabled.
The default is No, for optimal security and to reduce network traffic.
Controls how the Cisco VCS Expressway reacts to remote client authentication requests by selecting whether or not the Cisco VCS Control should check the home nodes.
The request asks whether the client may try to authenticate the user by OAuth token, and includes a user identity with which the Cisco VCS Control can find the user's home cluster:
Yes: The get_edge_sso request will ask the user’s home Unified CM if OAuth tokens are supported. The home Unified CM is determined from the identity sent by the Jabber client's get_edge_sso request.
No: If the Cisco VCS is configured not to look internally, the same response will be sent to all clients, depending on the Edge authentication settings.
The option to choose depends on your implementation and security policy. If all Unified CM nodes support OAuth tokens, you can reduce response time and overall network traffic by selecting No. Or select Yes if you want clients to use either mode of getting the edge configuration - during rollout or because you can't guarantee OAuth on all nodes.
Caution 
Setting this to Yes has the potential to allow rogue inbound requests from unauthenticated remote clients. If you specify No for this setting, the Cisco VCS prevents rogue requests.
No
Identity providers: Create or modify IdPs
Available if Authentication path is SAML SSO or SAML SSO and UCM/LDAP.
Selecting an Identity Provider
Cisco Collaboration solutions use SAML 2.0 (Security Assertion Markup Language) to enable SSO (single sign-on) for clients consuming Unified Communications services.
If you choose SAML-based SSO for your environment, note the following:
SAML 2.0 is not compatible with SAML 1.1 and you must select an IdP that uses the SAML 2.0 standard.
SAML-based identity management is implemented in different ways by vendors in the computing and networking industry, and there are no widely accepted regulations for compliance to the SAML standards.
The configuration of and policies governing your selected IdP are outside the scope of Cisco TAC (Technical Assistance Center) support. Please use your relationship and support contract with your IdP Vendor to assist in configuring the IdP properly. Cisco cannot accept responsibility for any errors, limitations, or specific configuration of the IdP.
Although Cisco Collaboration infrastructure may prove to be compatible with other IdPs claiming SAML 2.0 compliance, only the following IdPs have been tested with Cisco Collaboration solutions:
OpenAM 10.0.1
Active Directory Federation Services 2.0 (AD FS 2.0)
PingFederate®6.10.0.4
-
Identity providers: Export SAML data
Available if Authentication path is SAML SSO or SAML SSO and UCM/LDAP.
For details about working with SAML data, see SAML SSO Authentication Over the Edge.

Allow Jabber iOS clients to use embedded Safari
By default the IdP or Unified CM authentication page is displayed in an embedded web browser (not the Safari browser) on iOS devices. That default browser is unable to access the iOS trust store, and so cannot use any certificates deployed to the devices.
This setting optionally allows Jabber on iOS devices to use the native Safari browser. Because the Safari browser is able to access the device trust store, you can now enable password-less authentication or two factor authentication in your OAuth deployment.
A potential security issue exists for this option. The mechanism to return browser control from Safari to Jabber after the authentication completes, uses a custom URL scheme that invokes a custom protocol handler. It's possible that another application other than Jabber could intercept the scheme and gain control from iOS. In that case, the application would have access to the OAuth token in the URL.
If you are confident that your iOS devices will not have other applications that register the Jabber custom URL scheme, for example because all mobile devices are managed, then it's safe to enable the option. If you are concerned about the possibility of another app intercepting the custom Jabber URL, then do not enable the embedded Safari browser.
No
SIP token extra time to live
Available if Authorize by OAuth token is On.
Optionally extends the time-to-live for simple OAuth tokens (in seconds). Gives users a short window to accept calls after their credentials expire. However, it increases the potential security exposure.
