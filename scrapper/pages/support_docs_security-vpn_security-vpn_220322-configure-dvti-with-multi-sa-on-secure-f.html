Introduction
This document describes how to configure a DVTI on a Cisco Secure Firewall (Hub), with multiple remote extranet devices (spokes).
Background
Dynamic Virtual Tunnel Interfaces
Dynamic Virtual Tunnel Interfaces (DVTI) can provide highly secure and scalable connectivity for remote-access Virtual Prive Networks (VPN).
DVTIs can be used for both the Hub and Spoke configuration. The tunnels provide an on-demand separate virtual access interface for each VPN session. 
1. The spoke initiates an IKE exchange request with the hub for a VPN connection.
2. The hub authenticates the spoke.
3. The Cisco Secure Fireawall Management Centerassigns a dynamic virtual template on the hub.
4. The virtual template dynamically generates a virtual access interface on the hub. This interface is unique for the VPN session per spoke.
5. The hub establishes a dynamic VTI tunnel with the spoke throuh the virtual access interface.
6. The hub and spoke exchange traffic over the tunnel with dynamic routing protocols (BGP/OSPF/EIGRP) or with protected networks feature (Multiple-Security Assosiations VTI).
7. Dynamic VTIs function like any other interface so that you can apply QoS, firewall rules, routing protocols and other features as soon as the tunnel is active. 
8. A single DVTI is created at the HUB device and multiple Static Tunnel Interfaces for multiple remote/spoke sites.
Note: Cisco Secure Firewall added support fot DVTI on version 7.3 and currently it only supports one single DVTI as per Cisco bug ID CSCwe13781. Only registered Cisco users can access internal Cisco tools and information.
Multiple Security Asssosiation VTI feature was implemented in order to support compatibility between route based VPN and policy based VPN systems,
Prerequisites
Have at least two Cisco Secure Firewall devices already registered with the Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center with basic routing configuration to work as one hub and one spoke-1 respectively with one Loopback interface on each device to simulate local networks on premises of 192.168.5.0/24 (hub) and  remote local network of 192.168.6.0/24 (spoke-1).
Have one ASA in place with basic routing configuration and IKEv2 support to work as a spoke-2 with one Loopback interface pre configured to simulate remote local network of 192.168.7.0/24.
Have one Cisco IOS / Cisco IOSXE router with basic routing configuration and IKEV2 support to work as a spoke-3 with one Loopback interface pre configured to simulate remote local network of 192.168.8.0/24.
Requirements
Knowledge on VPN technologies and IKEv2 protocol.
Knowledge on Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center GUI (FMC) navigation and configuration for Cisco Secure Firewall devices.
Basic configuration knowledge on Cisco IOS-XE devices.
Basic IPV4 routing concepts.

Configure
Network Diagram
Note: All local and remote subnets are simulated with Loopback interfaces previously configured on each device.
Configurations
1.Log in into FMC GUI with administrator credentials.
2. From the FMC dashboard view, go to Devices and click on Site To Site under VPN options.
3.From the Site to Site dashboard, click on + Site to Site VPN to create a new Site to Site topology.
4. From the Create New VPN Topology menu, specify the new name and select Route Based (VTI) as the VPN type of the new topology, check IKEv2 protocol from the IKE Version options, select Hub and Spoke under the Network Topology settings and click on the + icon from the Hub Nodes section to designate a new Hub device.
5. From the Add Endpoint window, select the device that works as the hub and click on the + icon next to Dynamic Virtual Tunnel Interface dropdown menu to create a new DVTI.
6. From the Add Virtual Tunnel Interface menu, specify the name of the new Tunnel interface, assign it to the desired Security Zone, select the Tunnel Source with its IP and click on the + icon under the IP Address configuration in order to create a new Loopback interface next to the Borrow IP option.
Cisco recommends to configure the Borrowed IP for the dynamic interface from a Loopback interface.
Note: Tunnel source interface needs to be routable and able to reach remote spokes peer IPs
7. From the Add Loopback Interface window, specify the name of the interface with its ID and go to IPv4 tab.
8. From the IPv4 tab select Use Static IP under the IP Type option from the dropdown menu and specify the IP Address that belongs to the DVTI and click OK.
Note: Hub DVTI has an IP Address of 192.168.17.1/32.
9. From the Add Virtual Tunnel Interface menu, new Loobpack is displayed under the dropdown menu, select it and click OK.
10. A Virtual Tunnel Interface Added window is prompted that indicates the new DVTI has been created, click Ok and continue.
11. From the Add Endpoint window, new DVTI is displayed under Dynamic Virtual Tunnel Interface dropdown bar, select it, check the Send Virtual Tunnel Interface IP to peers box option along with the Allow incoming IKEv2 routes from the peers option and click on the + next to the Protected Networks settings in order to specify the networks behind the hub device.
Note: In this example, a second loopback interface on the hub simulates a host in the local OnPREM subnet as part of the protected network with an IP Address of 192.168.5.1/24.
12. On the Available Networks section, identify the subnet that simulates the local protected network as well as the DVTI subnet (192.168.17.0/24) and click on Add and then OK to apply the change.
Note: In this article a network object has been preconfigured as OnPREM with the 192.168.17.0/24 network. DVTI subnet needs to be added in order to protect traffic that is sourced from the tunnel interfaces.
13. Confirm the new protected network object has been added and click OK.
14. Confirm the new hub device has been added under the Hub Nodes section and click on the + next to the Spoke Nodes section to add a new endpoint as a remote spoke-1.
15. From the Add Endpoint window, select the device that runs as the spoke-1 and click on the + icon next to Static Virtual Tunnel Interface dropdown menu to create a new SVTI.
16. From the Add Virtual Tunnel Interface menu, specify the name of the new Tunnel interface, assign it to the desired Security Zone, select the Tunnel Source with its IP and click on the "+" icon under the IP Address configuration in order to create a new Loopback interface next to the Borrow IP option.
17. From the Add Loopback Interface window, specify the name of the interface with its ID and go to IPv4 tab.
18. From the IPv4 tab select Use Static IP under the IP Type option from the dropdown menu and specify the IP Address that belongs to the SVTI and click OK.
Note: Spoke-1 SVTI has an IP Address of 192.168.17.2/32.
19. From the Add Virtual Tunnel Interface menu, new Loobpack is displayed under the dropdown menu, select it and click OK.
20. A Virtual Tunnel Interface Added window is prompted that indicates the new DVTI has been created, click Ok and continue.
21. From the Add Endpoint window, new SVTI is displayed under StaticVirtual Tunnel Interface dropdown bar, select it, check the Send Virtual Tunnel Interface IP to peers option along with the Allow incoming IKEv2 routes from the peers option and click on the "+" next to the Protected Networks settings in order to specify the networks behind the spoke device.
Note: In this example, a second Loopback interface on the spoke-1 simulates a host in the remote network of 192.168.6.1/24.
22. On the Available Networks section, identify the remote protected network as well as the VTI subnet (192.168.17.0/24) and click on Add and then OK to apply the change.
Note: SVTI subnets needs to be added in order to protect, traffic that is sourced with tunnel interfaces.
23. Confirm the new protected network object has been added and click OK.
24. Confirm both hub and spoke nodes have been added to the new topology.
25. Go to IKE tab and specify the desired algorithms under "KEv2 Settings, select the Authentication Type with its attributes.
Note: In this article manual pre-shared key is used for authentication.
26. Go to IPsec tab, specify the desired algorithms under IKEv2 IPsec Proposals settings and check the Enable Reverse Route Injection option and go back to Endpoints tab.
Note: When no dynamic routing protocol is used Reverse Route Injection needs to be enabled in order to advertise OnPREM and remote protected networks across the tunnel between hub and all spokes.
27. Add one more extranet spoke-2, click on the + icon from the Endpoints tab.
28. From the Add Endpoint window Select Extranet from the dropdown menu under Device, specify the device name from spoke-2 and its peer IP Address and click OK.
29. Repeat steps 27 and 28 to add a new spoke-3 from the extranet.
Note: In this article CSRv1000 device is be used as the spoke-3.
30. Confirm new extrane spokes have been added to the topology and click on Save.
31. Deploy configuration on both Cisco Secure Firewall devices.
