Cisco ISE on Azure Cloud
Cisco ISE is available on Azure Cloud Services. To configure and install Cisco ISE on Azure Cloud, you must be familiar with Azure Cloud features and solutions. Some Azure Cloud concepts that you should be familiar with before you begin are:
Subscriptions and Resource Groups
Azure Virtual Machines: See Instances, Images, SSH Keys, Tags, VM Resizing.
You can deploy Cisco ISE on Microsoft Azure using an Azure Application or an Azure Virtual Machine. There are no differences in cost or Cisco ISE features when you deploy Cisco ISE using an Azure Application or an Azure Virtual Machine. We recommend using the Azure Application for the following advantages it offers in comparison to the Azure Virtual Machine:
Azure Application allows you to easily configure Cisco ISE-specific choices directly through its UI instead of a user-data field as in the case of Azure Virtual Machine configuration.
At the initial configuration of an Azure Application, you can choose an OS disk volume ranging between 300 and 2400 GB. However, during the initial configuration of a Azure Virtual Machine, you currently cannot change the OS disk volume. You must carry out more steps after Cisco ISE installation and launch to reconfigure the virtual machine.
You can directly choose from the specific Azure VM sizes that Cisco ISE supports.
You can configure a static private IP address at the initial configuration.
You can use the Azure Virtual Machine when:
You do not use the Azure portal UI to deploy Cisco ISE.
If you need to use one of the additional settings that are available in the Azure Virtual Machine configuration workflow.
The following task flows guide you through deploying Cisco ISE on Microsoft Azure using an Azure Application or an Azure Virtual Machine.

The Fsv2-series Azure VM sizes are compute-optimized and are best suited for use as PSNs for compute-intensive tasks and applications..
The Dsv4-series are general purpose Azure VM sizes that are best suited for use as PAN or MnT nodes or both and are intended for data processing tasks and database operations.
If you use a general purpose instance as a PSN, the performance numbers are lower than the performance of a compute-optimized instance as a PSN.
The Standard_D8s_v4 VM size must be used as an extra small PSN only.
For information on the scale and performance data for Azure VM sizes, see the Performance and Scalability Guide for Cisco Identity Services Engine.

Note
Do not clone an existing Azure Cloud image to create a Cisco ISE instance.
Known Limitations of Cisco ISE in Microsoft Azure Cloud Services
If you create Cisco ISE using the Azure Virtual Machine, by default, Microsoft Azure assigns private IP addresses to VMs through DHCP servers. Before you create a Cisco ISE deployment on Microsoft Azure, you must update the forward and reverse DNS entries with the IP addresses assigned by Microsoft Azure.
Alternatively, after you install Cisco ISE, assign a static IP address to your VM by updating the Network Interface object in Microsoft Azure:
Stop the VM.
In the Private IP address settings area of the VM, in the Assignment area, click Static.
Restart the VM.
In the Cisco ISE serial console, assign the IP address as Gi0.
Restart the Cisco ISE application server.
Dual NIC is supported with only two NICsâ€”Gigabit Ethernet 0 and Gigabit Ethernet 1. To configure a secondary NIC in your Cisco ISE instance, you must first create a network interface object in Azure, power off your Cisco ISE instance, and then attach this network interface object to Cisco ISE. After you install and launch Cisco ISE on Azure, use the Cisco ISE CLI to manually configure the IP address of the network interface object as the secondary NIC.
The Cisco ISE upgrade workflow is not available in Cisco ISE on Microsoft Azure. Only fresh installs are supported. However, you can carry out backup and restore of configuration data. For information on upgrading hybrid Cisco ISE deployments, see Upgrade Guidelines for Hybrid Deployments.
The public cloud supports Layer 3 features only. Cisco ISE nodes on Microsoft Azure do not support Cisco ISE functions that depend on Layer 2 capabilities. For example, working with DHCP SPAN profiler probes and CDP protocol functions through the Cisco ISE CLI are functions that are currently not supported.
When you carry out the restore and backup function of configuration data, after the backup operation is complete, first restart Cisco ISE through the CLI. Then, initiate the restore operation from the Cisco ISE GUI. For more information about the Cisco ISE backup and restore processes, see the Chapter "Maintain and Monitor" in the Cisco ISE Administrator Guide for your release.
SSH access to Cisco ISE CLI using password-based authentication is not supported in Azure. You can only access the Cisco ISE CLI through a key pair, and this key pair must be stored securely.
If you are using a Private Key (or PEM) file and you lose the file, you will not be able to access the Cisco ISE CLI.
Any integration that uses a password-based authentication method to access Cisco ISE CLI is not supported, for example, Cisco DNA Center Release 2.1.2 and earlier.
In Azure, a networking virtual network stack drops out-of-order fragments without forwarding them to the end virtual machine host. This design aims to address the network security vulnerability FragmentSmack, as documented in Azure and fragmentation.
Cisco ISE deployments on Azure typically leverage VPN solutions like Dynamic Multipoint Virtual Private Networks (DMVPN) and Software-Defined Wide Area Networks (SD-WAN), where the IPSec tunnel overheads can cause MTU and fragmentation issues. In such scenarios, Cisco ISE may not receive complete RADIUS packets and an authentication failure occurs without triggering a failure error log.
A possible workaround is to seek Microsoft technical support to explore any solutions in Azure that may allow out-of-order fragments to pass to the destination instead of being dropped.
Create A Cisco ISE Instance Using Azure Virtual Machine
Before you begin
Create an SSH key pair.
Create the VN gateways, subnets, and security groups that you require.
The subnet that you want to use with Cisco ISE must be able to reach the internet. In Microsoft Azure, in the Public Route Table window, configure the next hop of the subnet as the internet.
Procedure
Step 1
Go to https://portal.azure.com and log in to your Microsoft Azure account.
Step 2
Use the search field at the top of the window to search for Marketplace.
Step 3

In the Disks tab, retain the default values for the mandatory fields and click Next: Networking.
Step 9
In the Network Interface area, from the Virtual network, Subnet and Configure network security group drop-down lists, choose the virtual network and subnet that you have created.
Note that a subnet with a public IP address receives online and offline posture feed updates, while a subnet with a private IP address only receives offline posture feed updates.
Step 10
Click Next: Management.
Step 11
In the Management tab, retain the default values for the mandatory fields and click Next: Advanced.
Step 12
In the User data area, check the Enable user data check box.
In the User data field, enter the following information:
hostname=<hostname of Cisco ISE>
primarynameserver=<IPv4 address>
dnsdomain=<example.com>
ntpserver=<IPv4 address or FQDN of the NTP server>
timezone=<timezone>
password=<password>
ersapi=<yes/no>
openapi=<yes/no>
pxGrid=<yes/no>
pxgrid_cloud=<yes/no>
You must use the correct syntax for each of the fields that you configure through the user data entry. The information you enter in the User data field is not validated when it is entered. If you use the wrong syntax, Cisco ISE services might not come up when you launch the image. The following are the guidelines for the configurations that you submit through the user data field:
hostname: Enter a hostname that contains only alphanumeric characters and hyphens (-). The length of the hostname must not exceed 19 characters and cannot contain underscores (_).
primarynameserver: Enter the IP address of the primary name server. Only IPv4 addresses are supported.
You can add only one DNS server in this step. You can add additional DNS servers through the Cisco ISE CLI after installation.
dnsdomain: Enter the FQDN of the DNS domain. The entry can contain ASCII characters, numerals, hyphens (-), and periods (.).
ntpserver: Enter the IPv4 address or FQDN of the NTP server that must be used for synchronization, for example, time.nist.gov.
You can add only one NTP server in this step. You can add additional NTP servers through the Cisco ISE CLI after installation.
timezone: Enter a timezone, for example, Etc/UTC. We recommend that you set all the Cisco ISE nodes to the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) timezone, especially if your Cisco ISE nodes are installed in a distributed deployment. This procedure ensures that the timestamps of the reports and logs from the various nodes in your deployment are always synchronized.
password: Configure a password for GUI-based login to Cisco ISE. The password that you enter must comply with the Cisco ISE password policy. The password must contain 6 to 25 characters and include at least one numeral, one uppercase letter, and one lowercase letter. The password cannot be the same as the username or its reverse (iseadmin or nimdaesi), cisco, or ocsic. The allowed special characters are @~*!,+=_-.  See the "User Password Policy" section in the Chapter "Basic Setup" of the Cisco ISE Administrator Guide for your release.
ersapi: Enter yes to enable ERS, or no to disallow ERS.
openapi: Enter yes to enable OpenAPI, or no to disallow OpenAPI.
pxGrid: Enter yes to enable pxGrid, or no to disallow pxGrid.
pxgrid_cloud: Enter yes to enable pxGrid Cloud or no to disallow pxGrid Cloud. To enable pxGrid Cloud, you must enable pxGrid. If you disallow pxGrid, but enable pxGrid Cloud, pxGrid Cloud services are not enabled on launch.
Step 13
Click Next: Tags.
Step 14
To create name-value pairs that allow you to categorize resources, and consolidate multiple resources and resource groups, enter values in the Name and Value fields.
Step 15
Click Next: Review + Create.
Step 16
Review the information that you have provided so far and click Create.
The Deployment is in progress window is displayed. It takes about 30 minutes for the Cisco ISE instance to be created and available for use. The Cisco ISE VM instance is displayed in the Virtual Machines window (use the main search field to find the window).
What to do next
Because of a Microsoft Azure default setting, the Cisco ISE VM you have created is configured with only 300 GB disk size. Cisco ISE nodes typically require more than 300 GB disk size. You might see the Insufficient Virtual Memory alarm when you first launch Cisco ISE from Microsoft Azure.
After the Cisco ISE VM creation is complete, log in to the Cisco ISE administration portal to verify that Cisco ISE is set up. Then, in the Microsoft Azure portal, carry out the following steps in the Virtual Machines window to edit the disk size:
Stop the Cisco ISE instance.
Click Disk in the left pane, and click the disk that you are using with Cisco ISE.
Click Size + performance in the left pane.
In the Custom disk size field, enter the disk size you want, in GiB.

Postinstallation Tasks
For information about the postinstallation tasks that you must carry out after successfully creating a Cisco ISE instance, see the Chapter "Installation Verification and Post-Installation Tasks" in the Cisco ISE Installation Guide for your Cisco ISE release.
Compatibility Information for Cisco ISE on Azure Cloud
This section details compatibility information that is unique to Cisco ISE on Azure Cloud. For general compatibility details for Cisco ISE, see the Cisco Identity Services Engine Network Component Compatibility guide for your release.
Load Balancer Integration Support
You can integrate the Azure Load Balancer with Cisco ISE for load balancing RADIUS traffic. However, the following caveats are applicable:
The Change of Authorization (CoA) feature is supported only when you enable client IP preservation when you configure Session Persistence property in the load balancing rule in the Azure portal.
Unequal load balancing might occur because the Azure Load Balancer only supports source IP affinity and does not support calling station ID-based sticky sessions.
Traffic can be sent to a Cisco ISE PSN even if the RADIUS service is not active on the node as the Azure Load Balancer does not support RADIUS-based health checks.
For more information on the Azure Load Balancer, see What is Azure Load Balancer?
You can integrate the Azure Load Balancer with Cisco ISE for load balancing TACACS traffic. However, traffic might be sent to a Cisco ISE PSN even if the TACACS service is not active on the node because the Azure Load Balancer does not support health checks based on TACACS+ services.
Password Recovery and Reset on Azure Cloud
The following tasks guide you through the tasks that help your reset or recover your Cisco ISE virtual machine password. Choose the tasks that you need and carry out the steps detailed.
Reset Cisco ISE GUI Password Through Serial Console
