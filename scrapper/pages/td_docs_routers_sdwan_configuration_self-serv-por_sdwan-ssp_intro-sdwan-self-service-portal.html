Overview of the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal
The Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal is a cloud-infrastructure automation tool tailored for Cisco SD-WAN, which provides a quick way to provision, monitor, and maintain Cisco SD-WAN controllers on public cloud providers.
You can provision the following controllers using the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal:
Cisco vManage
Cisco vBond Orchestrator
Cisco vSmart Controller
Figure 1. Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal Benefits and Operations
The Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal can be configured to use an identity provider (IdP) to enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the portal access. You can configure the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal to use an IdP that lets you connect any user with any application on any device, using single sign-on (SSO).
Audience
This document is intended for Cisco customers such as service providers, partners, and other end users.
Prerequisites for the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal
Purchase a Cisco DNA subscription on the Cisco Commerce Workspace.
Create or use an existing Smart Account.
Create a Virtual Account associated with your Smart Account.
Add the device serial numbers on the Cisco Plug and Play (PnP) Connect portal.
For more information, see Cisco Network Plug and Play Connect Capability Overview.
Benefits of the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal
Enables visibility into critical statistics like instance CPU utilization
Provides a centralized dashboard for real-time monitoring of your Cisco SD-WAN overlay networks
Includes a wizard-driven user interface for easy navigation to the appropriate task in the workflow
Provides selection of cloud providers with options for specifying geographic locations for primary and secondary data storage
Supports secure log in using an IdP for SSO with multi-factor authentication (MFA)
Supports role-based access control (RBAC)
Supports provisioning of new overlay networks with custom subnets for on-premises TACACS server connections to overlays
Smart Account and Virtual Accounts
A Smart Account contains the licenses purchased by your organization. A Smart Account is a central repository where you can view purchased software assets, register, and report software use, and manage licenses across the entire organization.
For the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal, Cisco has granted the right to access the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal to the Smart Account administrator. A Smart Account administrator can now view and perform operational tasks related to a customer's hosted controller infrastructure, such as viewing the controllers’ IP addresses and modifying the controllers' IP access lists. If you do not wish for certain users to receive such access, go to the Manage Smart Account section of Cisco Software Central, and remove those users as Smart Account administrators, or use the IDP (identity provider) onboarding feature to grant access to the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal based on the trusted users in the IDP.
For more information, see Workflow for Smart Account and Virtual Accounts for Provisioning the Controllers.
Virtual Accounts are subaccounts within your Smart Account. Virtual Accounts help you organize your Cisco assets in a way that is logical for your business. You can set up Virtual Accounts by department, product, geography, or other designation that best fits your company's business model.
A default Virtual Account is created for you. We recommend that you create a dedicated Virtual Account for creating Cisco SD-WAN overlays.
For more information, see Create a Virtual Account Associated with Your Smart Account.
To provision a Cisco SD-WAN controller, a Virtual Account should be associated with an offer attribute that is SD-WAN capable. An SD-WAN-capable attribute is associated with a Virtual Account when ordering your Cisco DNA cloud license.

Note
When you order Cisco DNA licenses using the enterprise agreement, automatic association of Virtual Accounts to an SD-WAN-capable attribute is not available. You need to submit a cloud-controller provisioning request form through the Enterprise Agreement Workspace for the Cisco CloudOps team to provision the controllers. Contact Cisco SD-WAN Technical Support to request that the desired Virtual Account become available on the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal. After the desired Virtual Account is available on the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal, you can provision the controllers after providing the necessary enterprise agreement contract information.

Description
Support for PCI DSS Level 1 Certification for Cisco SD-WAN Overlay Networks
February 2022 Release
This feature provides Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) level 1 certification for Cisco SD-WAN overlay networks. Payment Card Industry (PCI)-compliance protects Cisco SD-WAN overlay networks against data breaches of cardholder data.
Information About PCI DSS Certification
Prerequisites for PCI DSS Certification
Information About PCI DSS Certification
PCI DSS is an industry information security standard designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information, maintain a secure environment. For more information, see the PCI Security Standards Council's website.
Companies handling credit card information are required to maintain data in a secure manner that reduces the likelihood of sensitive financial data from being stolen. If merchants fail to securely handle credit card information, that data can become compromised and used to make fraudulent purchases. Additionally, sensitive information about the cardholder can be used in identity fraud.
While Cisco SD-WAN does not directly store or process any cardholder data, Cisco SD-WAN is considered a Cloud Service Provider (CSP).
With Cisco SD-WAN software controller version 20.6.1, the Cisco SD-WAN solution is certified as a PCI DSS level 1 service provider.

Note
An upgrade to Cisco SD-WAN software controller version 20.6.1 does not mean you are PCI-certified. You must purchase the Cisco SD-WAN certified software controller version 20.6.1. Only the certified Cisco SD-WAN software controller released with Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1 has the PCI certification.
PCI DDS certification of Cisco SD-WAN controller software version 20.6.1 should not impact existing customers whose networks include the Cisco SD-WAN solution and were previously certified as PCI DDS compliant. For new customers who wish to obtain PCI DDS certification for their networks, we recommend purchasing the Cisco SD-WAN certified software controller version 20.6.1.
The Cisco SD-WAN solution includes security controls aligned with PCI DSS requirements. Many of Cisco’s customers have successfully attained PCI DSS certification, version 3.2.1, with Cisco SD-WAN as an integral part of their network.
Contact Cisco SD-WAN Technical Support if you have any questions regarding PCI DSS certification of your cloud controllers.
Prerequisites for PCI DSS Certification
PCI-certified overlay are applicable to cloud deployments only.
Ensure that you are using Amazon Web Services (AWS) as the cloud provider.
Ensure that you are using Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1 or other subsequent extended-support releases. Any other release versions, including standard-support releases, are not PCI DSS certified.
For more information on extended-support releases, see Cisco IOS XE Software Support Timeline for Cisco IOS XE Software Release Starting with 16.x.x.
