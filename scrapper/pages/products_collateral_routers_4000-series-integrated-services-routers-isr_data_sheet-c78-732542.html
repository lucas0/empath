Features and benefits
Cisco 4000 Family ISRs provide you with Cisco® Software Defined WAN (SDWAN) software features and a converged branch infrastructure. Along with superior throughput, these capabilities form the building blocks of next-generation branch-office WAN solutions.
Cisco Software Defined WAN
Cisco SDWAN is a set of intelligent software services that allow you to reliably and securely connect users, devices, and branch office locations across a diverse set of WAN transport links. SDWAN-enabled routers like the ISR 4000 dynamically route traffic across the “best” link based on up-to-the-minute application and network conditions for great application experiences. You get tight control over application performance, bandwidth usage, data privacy, and availability of your WAN links - control that you need as your branches conduct greater volumes of mission-critical business.
Cisco converged branch infrastructure
The Cisco 4000 Series ISRs consolidate many must-have IT functions, including network, compute, and storage resources. The high-performance, integrated routers run multiple concurrent services, including encryption, traffic management, and WAN optimization, without slowing your data throughput. And you can activate new services on demand through a simple licensing change.
Cisco intent based networking and digital network architecture (Cisco DNA)
The last few years has seen a rapid transformation and adoption of digital technologies. This puts pressure on the on the Network teams supporting this changing infrastructure - especially when provisioning, managing, monitoring and troubleshooting these diverse devices. Additionally innovations such as Software Defined WAN (SDWAN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Open APIs and Cloud Management show great promise in transforming Organizations IT networks. This transformation raises further questions and challenges for the IT teams.
The Cisco Digital Network Architecture (Cisco DNA) is an open, extensible, software-driven architecture that provides for faster innovation, helping to generate deeper insights, and deliver exceptional experiences across many different applications. Cisco DNA relies on intent-based networking, a revolutionary approach in networking that helps organizations automate, simplify, and secure the network.
The intent-based Cisco DNA network is:
●     Informed by Context: Interprets every byte of data that flows across it, resulting in better security, more customized experiences, and faster operations.
●     Powered by Intent: Translates your intent into the right network configuration, making it possible to manage and provision multiple devices and things in minutes.
●     Driven by Intuition: Continually learns from the massive amounts of data flowing through it and turns that data into actionable insight. Helps you solve issues before they become problems and learn from every incident.
Cisco DNA Center provides a centralized management dashboard across your entire network — the branch, campus, data center, and cloud. Rather than relying on box-by-box management, you can design, provision, and set policy end-to-end from the single Cisco DNA Center interface. This allows you to respond to organizational needs faster and to simplify day-to-day operations. Cisco DNA Analytics and Assurance and Cisco Network Data Platform (NDP) help you get the most from your network by continuously collecting and putting insights into action. Cisco DNA is open, extensible, and programmable at every layer. It integrates Cisco and third-party technology, open APIs, and a developer platform, to support a rich ecosystem of network-enabled applications.

Services plane: Enabling the Branch-in-a-Box
All Cisco ISR 4000 routers contain processing cores built-in as standard to allow full-featured services to run on-board. This includes the full-featured Cisco WAAS engine that provides application acceleration and highly responsive virtual desktop experience. The technology is known as Cisco Service Containers and it uses a standard hypervisor to allow x64 based applications to run.
The 4000 series routers can be fitted with Solid State Drives (SSD) and server cards for local storage and computing capability. The Cisco UCS-E server cards are available with 8-core Intel Xeon processors with up to 48GB of high speed DDR3 memory and three drives built in offering RAID 0, 1 and 5. This immense amount of compute power can eliminate the need for any dedicated servers at branch sites. UCS-E cards can be configured and managed using VMware vCenter and pooled with Data Center compute resources.
Software Subscription through Cisco DNA Licensing
The ISR4000 series supports software based subscription using Cisco DNA based licensing. Three Cisco DNA based software subscription licenses are available for the WAN portfolio: Cisco DNA Essentials, Cisco DNA Advantage and Cisco ONE Advantage allowing customers to have a single unified solution that spans across the ISR4000 series routers and its ASR1000 and ISR1000 counterparts
The license tiers are structured to support the growth in business needs enabling the customer to move from basic functionality using the Cisco DNA Essentials to full-functionality with the Cisco DNA Advantage and expanding that to include WAN Optimization and Analytics on the Cisco ONE Advantage. This provides complete flexibility to move the same license across end-points based on growing network and security requirements, growth in bandwidth based on user and application growth at the sites as also the ability to change the management of the platform from on-prem to cloud or vice-versa.
Cisco DNA Licenses are supported for all ISR4000 platforms using the Cisco DNA Center, the controller and analytics platform at the heart of Cisco’s intent-based network. For more information on the Cisco DNA Center and supported platforms, please refer to https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/networking/dna-center-platform/index.html
Enterprise NFV on ISR4000
Built to reduce costs without compromising vital network services, the UCS E-Series router-integrated branch blade servers provide support for a Virtualization-ready and Application-centric platform that can be seamlessly integrated on the ISR4000 platform. Customers can now install virtualized applications on the ISR4000 routers through the Cisco® Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) – a virtualization infrastructure that integrates full VM lifecycle management, monitoring, device programmability, and service chaining in a single, installable package. For more information on Enterprise NFV and NFVIS, please refer to the link at https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/enterprise-network-functions-virtualization-nfv/index.html#~stickynav=2
Support for DC Power
ISR4000 platforms support both DC and AC Power Supplies as options. Specifically, the ISR 4331 has two separate product SKU’s – the ISR4331/K9 and the ISR4331-DC/K9 which support AC and DC Power respectively, The ISR4400 can independently support an AC or a DC Power supply on the same chassis. While the 4300 supports between 24V and 60Vdc, the 4400 supports between 48V and 60Vdc. The 4331 provides for upto 250W of power rating while the 4400 provides upto 437W. It is important to note that when DC Power supplies are installed on the router, PoE based modules may not be used.
More details about the DC Power supplies and its capabilities can be found at the below url https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/access/4400/hardware/installation/guide4400-4300/C4400_isr/FRUs_Modules.html#49534
Product Performance and Scalability
The Cisco 4000 Family is built on a multicore CPU architecture. It runs modular Cisco IOS XE Software, which allows the platform to use to full advantage a distributed multicore architecture. The architecture of the Cisco 4000 separates control- and data-plane operations and integrates an industry-first services plane. This design delivers full-featured integrated services up to Layer 7 at high performance with the ability to deliver application-aware network services while maintaining a stable platform and a high level of performance during periods of heavy network traffic.
The ISR 4000 consists of 3 series of Routers – the ISR 4400 series, the 4300 series and ISR 4200 series whose performance levels may be represented by the chart below
Common for the new 4000 Family is that all platforms come with fixed maximum performance levels. One fixed base performance level is delivered as factory default with an optional performance-on-demand license to increase the base forwarding throughput. This scenario enables deployment in high-speed WAN environments through performance-on-demand licensing to double or, for one of the platforms, triple the router capacity without any hardware upgrades.
All 4000 platforms have their fixed performance levels set well within actual capacity, with the result that performance does not necessarily degrade when a service is added to the configuration. This setup provides a deterministic performance, eliminating a network administrator’s guesswork when planning for new services.
For a more detailed document on ISR 4000 Series Performance and Platform Scalability, please refer to the Performance Whitepaper at https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/routers/4000-series-integrated-services-routers-isr/white-paper-c11-734550.html
ISR 4000 Boost License
In addition to the Performance License, customers may now order a Booster (or Boost) License that allows the router to perform between five or more times than that of the throughput with Performance License. In contrast to the deterministic performance described above, in the Booster mode, the router does not provide the deterministic level of performance as provided when operating with the default license or with the Performance license.
The Boost License provides a license tier above the Performance License allowing customers to completely remove the ISR4000’s performance limiters. This will make the ISR 4000 platforms perform at entirely new performance levels, allowing for 4+ Gbps of IP Routing (CEF) performance on the 4400 series ISRs. For deployments using encryption, IPSec throughput with AES 256 increases to 250Mbps on the lowest platform up to 10Gbps on the ISR4461.
ISR 4000 Interfaces and Modules Support
The Cisco 4000 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISRs) are modular routers with LAN and WAN connectivity. The routers provide for Network Interface Module (NIM) slots and Enhanced service module (SM-X) slots offering a rich set of Modules, such as LAN, WAN and Wireless Interfaces plus a range of Compute engines for embedded services
For the complete list of supported modules on the ISR4000 Series refer to the Interfaces and Modules sheet at https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/routers/4000-series-integrated-services-routers-isr/relevant-interfaces-and-modules.html.
Software defined WAN with the ISR4000 Series
The ISR 4000 series is optimized for the Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN). For enterprises this means that business critical applications run faster, with more reliability and reduced Operational Expenditure (OpEx). The SDWAN achieves this by making all branches and Data Centers have the ability to monitor, control, move and report on streams of application data such as specific web (HTTP) traffic for example. The ISR 4000 series has deep packet inspection capability and can accurately identify and control thousands of different applications including custom in-house enterprise applications.
The entire SD-WAN implementation on the ISR4000 is maybe implemented by managing the end device either from the Cloud or On-Premise through ascending levels of throughput based licenses. All licenses that support SD-WAN, whether On-Premise or on Cloud are all enabled using Subscription Licenses. These subscription licenses enable all customers to seamlessly transition between On-Premise and Cloud management as needed. The license tiers are structured to support the growth in business needs through simple subscriptions that help simplify the journey to intent-based networking for the WAN.
The SDWAN subscriptions are aligned across three subscription licenses of Cisco DNA Essentials, DNA Advantage and Cisco DNA Premier, each expanding functionally. The Cisco DNA Essentials covers all types of connectivity & router life cycle management, support for Network & application visibility coupled with basic premise and transport security. The Cisco DNA Advantage provides for Advanced WAN topologies, Application aware policies supported by enhanced network security. The Cisco DNA Premier provides for Cloud connectivity with unlimited segmentation, Advanced Application optimization & Network Analytics, secured by advanced threat protection
For more information on Cisco SDWAN please refer to https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/software/one-wan-subscription/index.html
The benefits are immense;
1.     Business-critical applications no longer have to contend each other or with traffic that should be served on best effort basis.
2.     The Enterprise network becomes more reliable because multiple paths can be used.
3.     Costs are greatly reduced because dual MPLS links can be replaced with a mix of MPLS and Internet.
4.     The time to bring up new remote sites is dramatically reduced because the SD-WAN supports rapidly deployed DSL and 3G/4G LTE connections as easily as MPLS.
5.     Security is assured across these connections using a zero-touch secure VPN technology used by governments and finance organizations worldwide.
From a platform perspective, the ISR 4000 series has
1.     Separated control and data planes for Denial of Service (DoS) attack prevention and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) and firewall capability built-in.
2.     SaaS applications can have content locally cached. The caching is automatic and peers directly with Akamai technology to obtain intelligence.
3.     Application performance speed is greatly increased using in-built application acceleration technology that can locally cache at a byte-level.

WAN MACsec provides a line-rate network encryption solution over Layer 2 Ethernet transport services and can be leveraged outside campus networks, whether it be over Metro Ethernet transport or Data Center Interconnect (DCI) links. MACsec also secures WAN connections that are leveraging Ethernet as the link-layer media. For more information refer to the whitepaper at https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/solutions/CVD/Aug2016/WP-WAN-MACsecDep-Aug2016.pdf
Cisco Encrypted Threat Analytics
The rapid rise in encrypted traffic is changing the threat landscape. As more businesses become digital, a significant number of services and applications are using encryption as the primary method of securing information. Encrypted Threat Analytics (ETA) is a functionality that allows customers to do cryptographic assessments and identify malware communications in encrypted traffic through passive monitoring. Using information about events that occur inside of a flow or intraflow telemetry to identify malware communication in encrypted traffic means Encrypted Traffic Analytics can maintain the integrity of the encrypted flow without the need for bulk decryption. For more information and platform support refer to https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/solutions/collateral/enterprise-networks/enterprise-network-security/nb-09-encrytd-traf-anlytcs-wp-cte-en.pdf
Cisco Snort IPS and Cisco Umbrella Branch
Cisco® Snort® IPS for Cisco 4000 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISRs) offers a lightweight threat defense solution that uses industry-recognized Snort open-source Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) technology. It is perfect for customers who are looking for a cost-effective solution that provides one box for both advanced routing capabilities and integrated threat defense security to help comply with regulatory requirements.
Cisco Umbrella Branch is a cloud-delivered security service for the Cisco Integrated Services Router (ISR). It provides the first layer of defense against threats at branch offices. And it offers the simplest, fastest way to protect every device on your branch network. You gain visibility and enforcement at the DNS layer, so you can block requests to malicious domains and IPs before a connection is ever made.
When enabling MACsec, you will need to procure the Security and HSEC licenses to stay within the limits of federal export control regulations. When customers wish to enable ETA, the Security (SEC) license needs to be enabled. Enabling Snort needs a Security (SEC) license and a signature subscription license. Enabling Cisco Umbrella Branch needs an Umbrella Branch license and a subscription license.
Reducing Operational Costs using Cisco ISR
Support for Data Modelling
Enterprises and Service Providers (SP’s) wish to drive down the operational cost (opex) of their networks and increase the agility and speed with which they deliver new services furthered by investments in Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). Cisco routers provide support for Netconf and YANG data-modelling with increasing model coverage in successive releases
Software Maintenance Upgrades (SMU)
The ISR4000 routers now support Software Maintenance Upgrades (SMU)[7]. The Software Maintenance Upgrade (SMU) is a package that can be installed on a system to provide a patch fix or security resolution to a released image. An SMU package is provided on a per release and per component basis and is specific to the platform. An SMU is an independent and self-sufficient package and it does not have any prerequisites or dependencies. Please refer to https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/config-mgmt/configuration/xe-16-6/config-mgmt-xe-16-6-book/cm-smu.html for additional details

IOS-XE supports Smart Licensing beginning with image version 16.6.1 and Device Led Conversion with image version 16.9.1. Cisco Smart Licensing is a flexible licensing model that provides you with an easier, faster, and more consistent way to purchase and manage software across the Cisco portfolio and across your organization. And it’s secure – you control what users can access. With Smart Licensing you get:
●     Easy Activation: Smart Licensing establishes a pool of software licenses that can be used across the entire organization—no more PAKs (Product Activation Keys).
●     Unified Management: My Cisco Entitlements (MCE) provides a complete view into all of your Cisco products and services in an easy-to-use portal, so you always know what you have and what you are using.
●     License Flexibility: Your software is not node-locked to your hardware, so you can easily use and transfer licenses as needed.
To use Smart Licensing, you must first set up a Smart Account on Cisco Software Central (software.cisco.com). One or more Virtual Accounts maybe created under the Smart Account to enable the organization to logically segregate the purchased licenses. Device Led Conversion (DLC) allows the customer to convert all existing PAK and RTU licenses on the router into a Smart License.
