Introduction
This document describes the configuration of VASI NAT on routers that run Cisco IOS-XEÂ®.
Contributed by Rohit Nair, Cisco TAC Engineer.
Prerequisites
Requirements
There are no specific requirements for this document.
Components Used
This document is not restricted to specific software and hardware versions. This document applies to all Cisco routers and switches that run Cisco IOS-XE.
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.


Background Information
Devices that run on IOS-XE do not support classical inter-vrf nat configurations as those found on IOS devices. Support for Inter-vrf NAT on IOS-XE is achieved via VASI implementation.
VASI provides the ability to configure services such as IPsec, firewall and NAT to traffic that flows between VRF instances.
VASI is implemented by configuring VASI pairs, where each of the interfaces in the pair is associated with a different VRF instance. The VASI virtual interface is the next-hop interface for any packet that needs to be switched between these two VRF instances. The pairing is done automatically based on the two interface indexes such that the vasileft interface is automatically paired to the vasiright interface. Any packet that enters the vasileft interface is automatically forwarded to its paired vasiright interface.
Working of VASI
When an inter-VRF VASI is configured on the same device, the packet flow happens in the following order:
A packet enters the physical interface that belongs to VRF 1.
Before forwarding the packet, a forwarding lookup is done in the VRF 1 routing table. Vasileft1 is chosen as the next hop, and the Time to Live (TTL) value is decremented from the packet. Usually, the forwarding address is selected on the basis of the default route in the VRF. However, the forwarding address can also be a static route or a learned route. The packet is sent to the egress path of vasileft1 and then automatically sent to the vasiright1 ingress path.
When the packet enters vasiright1, a forwarding lookup is done in the VRF 2 routing table, and the TTL is decremented again (second time for this packet).
VRF 2 forwards the packet to the physical interface.
Configure
The following scenarios describe basic inter-vrf NAT configuration.

Each VASI interface will be paired to a different VRF instance.

NAT Configuration:
In this example, NAT is to be configured with the following requirements:
1. Static NAT      - Source IP of 192.168.1.1 should be translated to 172.16.1.5
2. Dynamic NAT - Source subnet of 192.168.1.0/24 should be translated to 172.16.1.5 
Scenario 1 - NAT on Vasiright
In most cases, the WAN interface would be on the outgoing VRF, VRF_RIGHT in this topology. In such cases, NAT can be configured between the vasiright and the WAN interface; traffic coming in on the vasiright interface from vasileft will be configured as NAT inside, while the WAN interface would be the NAT outside interface.
In this scenario, we use static routes to traffic between the VRFs. A static route for the destination 172.16.0.0 subnet is configured on VRF_LEFT pointing to the vasileft interface and another route for the source subnet 192.168.0.0 is configured on VRF_RIGHT pointing to the vasiright interface.

Note
Do not configure NAT to translate the source IP to the WAN interface IP; the router will treat return traffic to be destined to itself and will not forward traffic to the vasi interface.

Scenario 2 - NAT on Vasileft
NAT can also be configured solely on the vasileft side, i.e VRF_LEFT and have traffic NATTED before it is sent to VRF_RIGHT. The incoming interface on VRF_LEFT will be considered as the NAT inside interface, and vasileft 1 will be configured as the NAT outside interface.
In this scenario, we use static routes to traffic between the VRFs. A static route for the destination 172.16.0.0 subnet is configured on VRF_LEFT pointing to the vasileft interface and another route for the source natted IP 172.16.1.5 is configured on VRF_RIGHT pointing to the vasiright interface.
