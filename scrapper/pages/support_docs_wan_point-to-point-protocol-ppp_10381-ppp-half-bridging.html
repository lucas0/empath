Introduction
This document provides a sample configuration for using PPP half-bridging to connect routed and bridged networks.
Prerequisites
Requirements
There are no specific requirements for this document.
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
Cisco IOS® Software Release 12.2(7b).
Two Cisco 2500 series routers. Each has at least one ISDN BRI interface.
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Related Products
This configuration can also be used with these hardware and software versions:
Any serial interface, such as serial, Basic Rate Interface (BRI), Primary Rate Interface (PRI), and so on.
Cisco IOS Software Release 11.2.
Any router running Cisco IOS software as mentioned above, and at least one ISDN-BRI port. However, the half-bridge feature can be used on a router with a serial interface.
Conventions
For more information on document conventions, refer to Cisco Technical Tips Conventions.
Background Information
The bridge sends bridge packets to the PPP half-bridge that converts them to routed packets and forwards them to other router processes. Likewise, the PPP half-bridge converts routed packets to Ethernet bridge packets, and sends them to the bridge on the same Ethernet subnetwork.
Note: This configuration does not cover a full bridge on both sides. For such a configuration refer to the Bridging Across ISDN document.
Be aware that bridging on an ISDN connection tends to keep the connection active for very long periods, if not permanently. If the Telco charges for ISDN based on connection time, this can result in a very large bill. Consequently, this scenario is recommended for those who have unlimited-usage ISDN lines.
Note: An interface cannot function as both a half-bridge and a bridge. Cisco IOS software supports no more than one PPP half-bridge per Ethernet subnetwork.
Configure
In this section, you are presented with the information to configure the features described in this document.
Note: To find additional information on the commands used in this document, use the Command Lookup Tool (registered customers only) .
Network Diagram
This document uses this network setup:
Configurations
This document uses these configurations:
Venus
This router is configured as a full bridge with IP routing disabled. The device dials when any bridged traffic arrives.
Saturn
This router has been configured as a half bridge. Note that the dialer string, dialer group, and dialer list commands are not configured on this side. So this router will never dial, but will accept incoming calls. This prevents the router from dialing the remote router. We have turned IP routing on here. Full bridging software is not configured on this router. PPP half bridge is running on the BRI interface, so commands like show bridge and show spanning-tree do not yield any output on this router.

Verify
This section provides information you can use to confirm your configuration is working properly.
Certain show commands are supported by the Output Interpreter Tool (registered customers only) , which allows you to view an analysis of show command output.
show isdn status—displays the L1, L2, and L3 status of the ISDN interfaces.
show dialer—displays the status of the dialer, and the individual status of the ISDN channels.
show bridge—displays classes of entries in the bridge forwarding database, in privileged EXEC mode.
show interface—displays the status of various interfaces, including the Serial and BRI interfaces.
show arp—checks the ARP mapping. ARP is a protocol used to map the Layer 2 address (MAC address) to a Layer 3 address (IP address).
show spanning-tree—displays the spanning-tree topology known to the router.

Troubleshoot
This section provides information you can use to troubleshoot your configuration.
Troubleshooting Resources
Troubleshooting procedures for incoming and outgoing ISDN calls are explained in the Dialup Technology: Troubleshooting Techniques document. Additional information on how to troubleshoot ISDN layer 1, layer 2 and layer 3 issues are given in Using the show isdn status Command for BRI Troubleshooting and Troubleshooting ISDN BRI Layer 3 using the debug isdn q931 Command.
Troubleshooting Commands
Certain show commands are supported by the Output Interpreter Tool (registered customers only) , which allows you to view an analysis of show command output.
Note: Before issuing debug commands, refer to Important Information on Debug Commands.
debug dialer—indicates when interesting traffic has been detected, and when dialing is initiated.
debug isdn event—indicates ISDN activity occurring on the user side of the ISDN interface, and is similar to debug isdn q931.
debug isdn q931—provides information about call setup and teardown of ISDN network connections (Layer 3), between the local router (user side) and the network.
debug isdn q921—displays the data link layer (Layer 2) access procedures that are taking place at the router on the D-channel (LAPD) of its ISDN interface.
debug ppp negotiation—performs negotiation of PPP options and Network Control Protocol (NCP) parameters.
debug ppp authentication—allows the exchange of Challenge Authentication Protocol (CHAP) and Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) packets.
