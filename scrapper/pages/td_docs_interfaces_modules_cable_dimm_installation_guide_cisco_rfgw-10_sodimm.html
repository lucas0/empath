Replacing the Dual In-Line Memory Module
Caution Dual in-line memory modules (DIMMs) are ESD-sensitive components and can be damaged due to mishandling. Ensure that it is handled with care during installation and removal.
Warning Only trained and qualified personnel should be allowed to install, replace, or service this equipment. Statement 1030.
Required Tools and Equipment
Number 2 Phillips screwdriver
Small flat-blade screwdriver
ESD-preventive wrist strap
Antistatic mat or static shielding bag
Replacement SDRAM DIMM
Step 1 Attach an ESD-preventive wrist strap and ensure that it makes good contact with your skin.
Step 2 Connect the equipment end of the wrist strap to the metal backplate of the chassis, avoiding contact with the connectors.
Step 3 Unscrew the captive screws on the front of the line card to remove the line card from the Cisco RF Gateway 10 chassis. Simultaneously, pivot both the ejector levers away from the line card to disengage the card from the backplane.
Step 4 Slide the card out from the chassis and place it on an antistatic surface or in a static shielding bag with the component-side up.
Step 5 Locate the SDRAM DIMM socket on the card. (See Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3 .)

    Step 6 Release the clips on the DIMM, which releases it from its socket.
Caution Handle the DIMM only along the edges. Do not touch the memory modules, pins, or traces (metal fingers along the connector edge) to avoid damage.

Step 7 Pull the clips away with your thumb, bracing your forefingers against the rails. (See Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6 ).
Step 8 When both ends of the DIMM are released from the socket, grasp the ends of the DIMM with your thumb and forefinger, and pull it completely out of the socket. Then, in compliance with electronic waste laws, dispose the DIMM.
Step 9 Install the replacement DIMM by holding the component-side facing up with the connector edge (the metal fingers) away from you. Keep the sides of the DIMM between your thumb and index finger with your middle finger against the far edge and opposite the connector edge. (See Figure 7 .)

  Step 10 Tilt the DIMM to the same angle as the socket, then insert the connector edge into the socket. Gently push into place until the clips snap into place.
Caution It is normal to feel some resistance when installing a DIMM. Do not use excessive force or touch the surface components to avoid damage.
Step 11 Check the two alignment notches, and ensure that the clips are visible. If necessary, carefully remove and re-seat the DIMM.
Step 12 Align the top and bottom edges of the line card with the guides in the chassis carefully, and then install the line card by sliding the card into the slot.
Step 13 Close the ejector levers to secure the card in the backplane, and tighten the captive screws on the line card.
