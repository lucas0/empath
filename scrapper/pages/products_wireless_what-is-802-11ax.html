What Is 802.11ax?
The next-generation 802.11ax Wi-Fi standard, also known as Wi-Fi 6, is the latest step in a journey of nonstop innovation. The standard builds on the strengths of 802.11ac, adding efficiency, flexibility, and scalability that allows new and existing networks increased speed and capacity with next-generation applications.
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) proposed the 802.11ax standard so that it can couple the freedom and high speed of Gigabit Ethernet wireless with the reliability and predictability found in licensed radio.

What are the benefits of 802.11ax?
802.11ax allows enterprises and service providers to support new and emerging applications on the same wireless LAN (WLAN) infrastructure, while delivering a higher grade of service to older applications. This scenario sets the stage for new business models and increased Wi-Fi adoption.
Is 802.11ax different from Wi-Fi 6?
No, they are the same thing. The Wi-Fi Alliance started a campaign to coin the term “Wi-Fi 6” when referring to the IEEE 802.11ax standard. It indicates that the standard is the sixth generation of Wi-Fi. The premise was that simplification of the marketing message could help Wi-Fi be better positioned relative to the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards used in cellular (such as 5G wireless technology).
When will the 802.11ax standard be ratified?
The IEEE-Standards Association is currently scheduled to ratify the final IEEE 802.11ax amendment in the middle of 2020. However, the Wi-Fi Alliance is expected to certify key features from the amendment in about August 2019, with additional features (including operation in the 6GHz band) certified over the next couple of years.

802.11ax benefits
802.11ax will let access points support more clients in dense environments and will provide a better experience for typical wireless LAN networks. It will also provide a more predictable performance for advanced applications such as 4K or 8K video, high-density high-definition collaboration apps, all-wireless offices, and the Internet of Things (IoT). 802.11ax will drive Wi-Fi toward the future as the growth of wireless continues.

802.11ax access points
There are some 802.11ax access points already on the market targeted for early adopters and customers who are eager to test the new standard. The access points that are released early will be pre-standard APs because the standard will not yet have been ratified. This means key features that are part of 802.11ax may not be supported on some of these initial, pre-standard access points. However, when available, some of these access points will be able to become certified through software updates and 802.11ax features will be supported. This approach is similar to the introduction of prior generations such 802.11ac and 802.11n.
