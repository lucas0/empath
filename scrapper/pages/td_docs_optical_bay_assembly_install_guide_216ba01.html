Safety Recommendations
The following guidelines will help to ensure your safety and protect the equipment. This list does not include every potentially hazardous situation.
•Never attempt to lift an object that might be too heavy for you to lift by yourself.
•Always disconnect the power source and unplug all power cables before installing or removing the bay assembly.
•Carefully examine your work area for possible hazards such as moist floors, ungrounded power extension cables, and missing power grounds.
•When using equipment such as a forklift or pallet jack to move the bay assembly to another location, use only moving equipment that is capable of preventing the bay assembly from tipping.
•Do not wear loose clothing, jewelry (including rings and chains), or other items that could get caught in the bay assembly.
•Do not work alone if potentially hazardous conditions exist.
Included Material
The five-component bay assembly ships with the following materials:
•Fuses
•Electrical tape
•Anti-oxidant compound
•Lacing twine
•Tubing
•Emery cloth
•Tags
•Fishe-paper
•Floor cutout template
•ESD wrist strap
•Unpacking and installation documentation
•Touch up paint
Recommended Material
Because most of the installation is complete when you receive the system, the bay assembly requires little installation material. The most significant tasks are removing the packaging from the bay assembly and removing the bay assembly from the shipping pallet. Because the actual installation of the bay assembly in each facility is done according to local site practice, your material needs may vary.
Cisco recommends that you have the following items on hand for installation:
•A forklift or pallet jack to move the packaged bay assembly to the unpacking/staging area
•A pair of scissors to cut the plastic banding on the shipping container
•Utility blankets or their equivalent to protect the bay assembly while on the forklift or pallet jack
•Phillips screw driver or cordless drill with Phillips bit
•3/4 inch socket or box-end wrench for the earthquake floor bolts
•Four optional kits listed in Table 3 that can be ordered separately
•Use this guide in conjunction with the latest release of Cisco ONS 15216 documentation.
Unpacking Instructions
The ONS 15216 five-component bay assembly ships in a corrugated container that covers the unit on its shipping pallet. After removing the corrugated container, you must remove the bolts that hold the rack to the pallet before moving the unit to the desired location. Figure 2 shows the five-component bay assembly on a shipping pallet.
Caution Cisco recommends that a minimum of three people move the bay assembly.
Step 1 Use a forklift or pallet jack to place the shipping container as close to the installation location as possible.
Step 2 Cut the plastic banding off of the cardboard shipping container.
Step 3 Remove the cap from the corrugated container.
Step 4 Pull the side panels away from the shipping pallet and set it aside.
Step 5 Remove the base plate from the bottom front of the rack:
a. Remove the two screws that fasten the kick plate to the rack.
b. Pull the base plate away.
Step 6 Remove the four bolts that hold the rack to the pallet (rack base bolts).
Step 7 Remove the vertical extenders if necessary.
Figure 2 ONS 15216 Five-Component Bay Assembly on Shipping Pallet
Warning Stability hazard. The rack stabilizing mechanism must be in place, or the rack must be bolted to the floor before you slide the unit out for servicing. Failure to stabilize the rack can cause the rack to tip over.
Installation Instructions
Prior to installing the bay assembly, you should prepare your raised floor plan.
Raised Floor Plan
Level Equipment
The raised floor is laser-leveled at the time of the floor installation, so no leveling blocks or shims should be necessary to level the frames. This is especially important in seismic zones 2B and higher, because leveling blocks will cause a rocking motion of the frames during an earthquake.
Cut and Drill Removable Floor Tile
Step 1 Mark the removable floor tile for the cable access to the rack using one of the following methods: the floor cutout template (700-14208-XX) included in the accessory kit that ships with the bay assembly, the diagrams in Figure 3, a floor plan drawing, or place the frame in the proper footprint and mark the tile from the base of the frame or cabinet.
Step 2 Mark the tile for the frame anchoring holes.
Step 3 Remove the tile.
Step 4 Cut cable access holes.
Step 5 Drill the anchoring holes through the tile in an area away from the equipment to ensure the equipment area is not contaminated with metal shavings or debris.
Note If the floor plan identifies a future frame on the same tile as the one you are adding a frame to, you must drill and cut the tile for the future frame at this time because you cannot remove the tile later.
Note It will be necessary to use alternate anchoring holes in the event the primary holes are obstructed by the stringers that support the removable tile.
Figure 3 Raised Floor Cutout for CORE and Local
Framework Anchoring
To anchor framework to a raised floor, you must know in what earthquake zone the equipment is being installed. Zones 0-2A have the frames bolted to the raised floor through a u-channel across the bottom of the floor tile and stringers. Zones 2B-4 have 1/2-inch threaded rods extending through the raised floor and connected to seismic anchors with coupling nuts. In all zones, standard hold-down parts are used on top of the floor with threaded rods of varying lengths. Anchors and hold-down material must be engineered for proper seismic zone.
Seismic Zones 0-2A
To fasten network and unequal flange duct framework to a raised floor:
Step 1 Place a 1 5/8 x 1 5/8 u-channel (with continuous slot down) under the stringers and use clips to cover the free ends of the u-channel where the threaded rod goes through to prevent it from spreading when compressed.
In the base of the frame, use the hold-down plate engineered for that frame, threaded rod, nut, washer, insulating bushing, and hold-down washer.
On the bottom of the u-channel, use the clip, washer, lockwasher, and nut.
Note The u-channel should not extend more than four inches past the edge of the stringers or it will block access under the floor.
Warning End caps must be used on the u-channel to prevent injury.
Step 2 Torque the nut to 30 ft-lbs.
Note Do not over tighten the nut; the tile will become deformed and will be uneven with surrounding tiles.
Seismic Zones 2B-4
In seismic zones 2B and higher, threaded rods are run down to seismic anchors with coupling nuts from the concrete floor. U-channels are not used in higher earthquake zones. Anchor the rack at all four corners in higher earthquake zones.
Note Do not over tighten threaded rods; floor tile will deform and make the floor uneven.
Install the ONS 15216 Five-Component Bay Assembly
The emphasis in the following installation instructions is to position the bay assembly in your facility after it has been removed from its shipping pallet. Perform actual installation and individual node provisioning according to local site practice.
Step 1 Use a utility blanket or its equivalent to protect the bay assembly while on the forklift or pallet jack.
Step 2 Position the forklift or pallet jack so that it faces the front (door side) of the bay assembly.
Step 3 With one person on each side of the bay assembly, position the forklift or pallet jack under the rack.
Step 4 If a safety strap is used to secure the bay assembly, fit the safety strap snugly around the bay assembly. Do not cinch the strap too tightly. Cinching the strap too tightly can result in component damage.
Step 5 Move the bay assembly to the installation site and unload it.
To avoid injury, make sure that a sufficient number of people are present.
Step 6 Install the bay assembly according to local site practice.
Step 7 After the rack is installed attach the extender bases and vertical extenders to both sides of the rack as needed.
Route Fiber Through the Base
Step 1 After installing the rack onto the raised floor slide the base plate out from the rack (if not already removed) (Figure 4).
Figure 4 Sliding the Base Plate Out from the Rack
Step 2 To route fiber, unscrew and remove the covers on the base plate and extender bases (Figure 5).
Figure 5 Base Plate and Extender Bases with Covers Removed
When the covers have been removed, you have access to the base of the rack and any holes previously cut into the raised floor tile, as shown in Figure 6.
Figure 6 Raised Floor Extender Base Fiber Routing Close-Up
You can use the base plate or extender base holes to route the fibers. Cisco recommends using the base plate holes for the bottom component or node and the extender base holes for the other components. All electrical cables will be routed in the back of the rack in the extender bases. Holes should already be cut out in the raised floor tile to compensate for any cables.
Step 3 Once all fiber cables have been placed in the front portion of the rack, replace the base plate by sliding it toward the back of the rack. Figure 7 shows the routed fiber with the base plate replaced.

GMT-TPA Fuse and Alarm Panel
The FAP included in the five-component bay assembly is a GMT-TPA combination that contains two analogous modules, one for each of it's two separate power buses, designated A and B. Each side has an LVD indicator, two TPA fuse holders with separate fuse alarm indicators, a power-on indicator, a GMT fuse holder and a GMT fuse alarm indicator (one alarm indicator for all five GMT fuses). Figure 11 shows the front view of the FAP and Figure 12 shows the rear view of the FAP.
Figure 11 GMT-TPA FAP (front view)
Figure 12 GMT-TPA FAP (rear view)
FAP Alarming
The Cisco ONS 15216 five-component bay assembly uses 4-pair, CAT 3-rated, twisted pair wire for FAP wiring. The alarming for the FAP must go to an existing 110-type, or 66-type block for the alarm circuits to work on the existing alarm circuitry created within the CO, CEV, or Hut. Figure 13 shows a close-up of the alarm pins and wiring. Figure 14 and Figure 15 show the 66-type and 110-type block tie downs.

Figure 15 110-Type Block Tie-Downs for Existing Alarm Circuitry
Ground and Power
The ground studs and power input and output terminals are mounted on the rear side of the FAP. The plastic protective covers install over the input and output power terminals. The covers prevent accidental contact with the terminals when power is present in the panel.
Warning Shut off the power from the power source or turn off the breakers before beginning work.
Warning This equipment is intended to be grounded. Ensure that the rack is connected to common office earth ground during normal use.
Warning Do not mix conductors of dissimilar metals in a terminal or splicing connector where physical contact occurs (such as copper and aluminum, or copper and copper-clad aluminum), unless the device is suited for the purpose and conditions of use.
Warning Connect the ONS 15216 only to a DC power source that complies with the safety extra-low voltage (SELV) requirements in IEC 60950-based safety standards.
Warning The ONS 15216 relies on the protective devices in the building installation to protect against short circuit, overcurrent, and grounding faults. Ensure that the protective devices are properly rated to protect the system, and that they comply with national and local codes.
Warning A readily accessible fuse must be incorporated in the fixed wiring.
Warning If you use redundant power leads to power the ONS 15216, disconnecting one lead will not remove power from the node.
Caution Always use the supplied ESD wristband when working with a powered ONS 15216. Plug the wristband cable into the ESD jack located on the lower-right outside edge of the shelf assembly.
Central Office Ground to Bay Wire Ground
Connect the CO ground to the bay wire ground according to local site practice.
Note The bay assembly ground must be attached to the common central office (CO) ground via an H TAP compression connector.
FAP Output and Input Power
Route and connect output and input power according to local site practice. Figure 16 through Figure 19 show output and input lugs and wiring and Table 1 and Table 2 list lug wiring positions.
Note CO power from the BDFB to the bay assembly must be a direct feed from a single breaker (one breaker for return, and one breaker for -48VDC) at the BDFB to the input connection of the bay assembly. The size or gauge of the power wire feed must be calculated by the distance from the BDFB to the FAP.
