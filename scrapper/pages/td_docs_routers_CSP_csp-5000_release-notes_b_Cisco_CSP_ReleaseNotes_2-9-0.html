This document describes the features and limitations for the Cisco Cloud Services Platforms 5000, Release 2.9.0.

Guest VNFs
Cisco CSP can host Cisco VNFs or third-party VNFs that are supported on KVM hypervisors. For more information about the support for VNFs, see the individual product release documentation.
Some of the Cisco VNFs available include the following:
Cisco Cloud Services Router (CSR) 1000V virtual router
Cisco IOS® XRv 9000 Router
Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)
Cisco Firepower™ NGFW Virtual
Cisco Prime® Virtual Network Analysis Module (vNAM)
Cisco Virtual Wide Area Application Services (vWAAS)
Cisco Web Security Virtual Appliance (WSAv)
Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE)
Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC)
Cisco Virtual Security Gateway (VSG) for Cisco Nexus® 1000V Series Switch deployments
Cisco Virtual Supervisor Module (VSM) for Cisco Nexus 1000V Series Switch deployments
Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM)
Non-Cisco Vendor Owned VNFs
You can run VNFs owned by various vendors on Cisco CSP 5000 Series Platforms that are running on the CSP-OS. Formal support for these VNFs requires a joint effort between Cisco and the VNF vendor.
Cisco offers VNF vendors a "for-fee" NFVIS 3rd-party certification program to test and certify their VNFs on Cisco’s virtual platforms. After the testing and certification is complete, the results are published on this page- Cisco Enterprise NFV Open Ecosystem and Qualified VNF Vendors
For more specific support details about VNF versions and test compatibility matrix with CSP-OS releases, see the VNF vendor release documentation on the vendor support site.
New and Enhanced Features
Cisco CSP Release 2.9.0 includes the following features and enhancements along with security and bug fixes:

Link State Monitoring for VNF: This feature allows you to monitor the link state of the VNF vNICs in addition to the IP.
VNF Data Store Migration: This feature allows you to migrate the storage location of VNFs between local, gluster, and NFS.
REST API for Uploading Images to all Cluster Nodes: This feature allows you to use the REST API to upload all CSP software images to the cluster members.
GUI Enhancements: This feature allows you to upgrade CSP (ISO and patch) and also generate tech-support using the GUI.
Support CPU and Memory Upgrade: This feature enables the CSP software to reread a CPU or memory hardware upgrade, and update the resource table during the CSP upgrade and reboot process.
