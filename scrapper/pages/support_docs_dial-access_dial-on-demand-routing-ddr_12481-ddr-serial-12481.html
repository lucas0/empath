Introduction
This sample configuration shows how you can use an ISDN BRI circuit to back up a leased line, WAN, or serial connection.
This document uses dialer profiles and the backup interface feature. The backup interface command puts the configured physical or logical interface in standby mode until such times as the primary interface goes down.
Prerequisites
Requirements
There are no specific requirements for this document.
Components Used
This configuration uses a BRI circuit to backup a serial link. Router ramses is doing the dial-out since the dialer string is configured on that router. In this configuration:
A Cisco 2500 router (ramses) is used, connected to a Cisco 2520 router (sphinx). Both routers are also equipped with BRI interfaces that are used for the backup link.
Both routers are running Cisco IOS Software Release 12.0.7T.
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Conventions
For more information on document conventions, refer to Cisco Technical Tips Conventions.
Configure
In this section, you are presented with the information to configure the features described in this document. These three steps complete this configuration:
Configure dial-on-demand routing (DDR) with Legacy DDR or dialer profiles. The sample configuration shown in this document uses dialer profiles.
Use the backup interface command to trigger the dialout call when the primary link fails.
Define interesting traffic.
Note: It is recommended that you configure the DDR connection (dialer 1 with BRI0) and verify that is working properly, before you configure the backup interface and backup delay commands. This allows you to effectively manage and troubleshoot dialer profiles, ISDN, PPP and authentication issues before you configure the backup.

Verify
This section provides information you can use to confirm your configuration is working properly.
Certain show commands are supported by the Output Interpreter Tool (registered customers only) , which allows you to view an analysis of show command output.
show isdn status???Displays the status of all ISDN interfaces or a specific ISDN interface.
show interface serial???Displays information about a serial interface.
show interface dialer???Displays information about a dialer interface.
debug dialer???Displays DDR information about the packets received on the dialer interface.
debug isdn q931???Shows call setup and tear down of the ISDN network connection (Layer 3) between the router and the ISDN switch.
debug ppp negotiation???Displays information on PPP traffic and exchanges while negotiating the PPP components including Link Control Protocol (LCP), Authentication, and NCP. A successful PPP negotiation will first open the LCP state, then Authenticate, and finally negotiate NCP.
debug ppp authentication???Displays the PPP authentication protocol messages, including Challenge Authentication Protocol (CHAP) packet exchanges and Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) exchanges. If you observe a failure, verify that the CHAP username and password are configured correctly.
Troubleshoot
This section provides information you can use to troubleshoot your configuration.
Troubleshooting Steps
Follow these instructions to troubleshoot your configuration:
Use the show isdn status command to ensure that the router is communicating properly with the ISDN switch. In the output, verify that:
Layer 1 Status is ACTIVE
Layer 2 Status State = MULTIPLE_FRAME_ESTABLISHED
This command also displays the number of active calls. Let's look at an example:
   ramses#show isdn status
   Global ISDN Switchtype = basic-net3
   ISDN BRI0 interface
   dsl 0, interface ISDN Switchtype = basic-net3
   Layer 1 Status:
   ACTIVE
   Layer 2 Status:
   TEI = 97, Ces = 1, SAPI = 0, State = MULTIPLE_FRAME_ESTABLISHED
   Layer 3 Status:
   0 Active Layer 3 Call(s)
   Activated dsl 0 CCBs = 0
   The Free Channel Mask: 0x80000003
   Total Allocated ISDN CCBs = 0

   ramses#show interface serial 0
   Serial0 is up, line protocol is up
   Hardware is HD64570
   Internet address is 3.3.3.1/24
   Backup interface Dialer1, failure delay 10 sec, secondary disable
   delay 30 sec

   ramses#show interface dialer 1
   Dialer1 is standby mode, line protocol is down 
 ! --- In standby mode.
   Hardware is Unknown
Since the backup interface is in standby mode, you do not see this information in the output of the show ip route command.
Let's look at the differences shown in the output when using an administrative distance (AD) and when not using one.
When Not Using an Administrative Distance
When not using an AD, you see the following output:
   sphinx#show interface dialer 1
   Dialer1 is up (spoofing), line protocol is up (spoofing)
   Hardware is Unknown
If you do not use an AD for the dialer on the router sphinx, you see the following output from the show ip route command:
   sphinx(config)#ip route 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.255 dialer1
   
 ! --- No AD used here.


   sphinx#show ip route 1.1.1.1
   Routing entry for 1.1.1.1/32
   Known via "static", distance 1, metric 0 (connected)
   Routing Descriptor Blocks:
   * directly connected, via Dialer1
   Route metric is 0, traffic share count is 1
   directly connected, via Serial0
   Route metric is 0, traffic share count is 1
The output displayed by the ping command looks similar to the following, in that it is missing one of the pings:
   sphinx#ping 1.1.1.1
   Type escape sequence to abort.
   Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 1.1.1.1, timeout is 2 seconds:
   .!.!.
When Using an Administrative Distance
When using an AD, you see the following output:
   sphinx(config)#ip route 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.255 dialer1 2
 
 ! --- The AD used here is two.


   sphinx#show ip route 1.1.1.1
   Routing entry for 1.1.1.1/32
   Known via "static", distance 1, metric 0 (connected)
   Routing Descriptor Blocks:
   * directly connected, via Serial0
   Route metric is 0, traffic share count is 1

   sphinx#ping 1.1.1.1
   Type escape sequence to abort.
   Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 1.1.1.1, timeout is 2 seconds:
   !!!!! 
Configure and verify that the DDR connection (between Dialer 1 and BRI0) is working properly before you configure the backup interface and backup delay commands. This allows you to verify that the dialer profile, ISDN, PPP, and authentication is functioning correctly before configuring the backup.
Once you have verified the DDR connection is working properly, you can proceed to the following backup troubleshooting steps outlined below:
Bring down the primary link.
Note: Do not use the shutdown command on the router with the backup interface command configured. This does not cause the Cisco IOS to dial the backup link. You can activate the backup by shutting down the primary interface on the router that does not have the backup interface command.
Note: In our scenario, the backup interface command is configured on ramses (the Cisco 2500 router). Therefore, performing a shutdown command on the primary interface of sphinx (the Cisco 2520 router) activates the backup link.
Note: You can physically bring down the primary connection by unplugging the cables, or using some equivalent method, in order to bring up the backup interface.
You should see a console message indicating that the backup interface (interface dialer 1) is up. This message only appears after the interval time, specified by the backup delay command, has expired. In this configuration, the backup activation delay is 10 seconds.
If you do not see this console message, check the backup delay timer.
   *Mar 1 03:54:00.451: %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface
   Serial0, changed state to down
   *Mar 1 03:54:11.467: %LINK-3-UPDOWN: Interface Dialer1, changed state to up
Use the show ip route command to view the routing table with the primary link down. You should observe a directly connected route to Dialer 1.
Ping the IP address of the remote router's loopback interface. If the link does not dial, verify that your interesting traffic definition permits ICMP traffic (pings).
Note: In our example, an AD of two is used for the route in the router sphinx (this can be any number other than one).
ip route 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.255 Dialer1 2
Note: The reason for this is that, if the primary link is up, half of the pings are lost. Since the both the dialer 1 and serial 0 interfaces are up, the route is installed for both interfaces. However, the dialer interface cannot send the packet since the BRI interface is not up.
