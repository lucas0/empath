Guest VNFs
Cisco CSP can host Cisco VNFs or third-party VNFs that are supported on KVM hypervisors. For more information about the support for VNFs, see the individual product release documentation.
Some of the Cisco VNFs available include the following:
Cisco Cloud Services Router (CSR) 1000V virtual router
Cisco IOS® XRv 9000 Router
Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)
Cisco Firepower™ NGFW Virtual
Cisco Prime® Virtual Network Analysis Module (vNAM)
Cisco Virtual Wide Area Application Services (vWAAS)
Cisco Web Security Virtual Appliance (WSAv)

Cisco Virtual Security Gateway (VSG) for Cisco Nexus® 1000V Series Switch deployments
Cisco Virtual Supervisor Module (VSM) for Cisco Nexus 1000V Series Switch deployments

Non-Cisco Vendor Owned VNFs
You can run VNFs owned by various vendors on Cisco CSP 5000 Series Platforms that are running on the CSP-OS. Formal support for these VNFs requires a joint effort between Cisco and the VNF vendor.
Cisco offers VNF vendors a "for-fee" NFVIS 3rd-party certification program to test and certify their VNFs on Cisco’s virtual platforms. After the testing and certification is complete, the results are published on this page- Cisco Enterprise NFV Open Ecosystem and Qualified VNF Vendors
For more specific support details about VNF versions and test compatibility matrix with CSP-OS releases, see the VNF vendor release documentation on the vendor support site.
