    Product overview
Cisco Webex® Contact Center Enterprise (Webex CCE) provides a comprehensive, customizable, highly secure solution to meet the complex needs of the world’s largest contact centers. See the Webex Contact Center Enterprise data sheet for full product details.
Webex Contact Center Enterprise Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is an add-on option for the Webex CCE solution. It is intended to assist partners and customers with the ability to migrate additional contact center systems to the cloud without adding the complexity of having adjunct systems remain on premises or be shifted to a different cloud.
Features and benefits
Customers that take advantage of the Webex CCE IaaS option will deploy their applications in the Webex CCE cloud. Cisco will provide:
1. Co-location facility space
Cisco will provide two tier-3 carrier co-location facilities at two data centers, each of which will provide space containing secure cabinets within a private caged area for the IaaS equipment. The secure cabinets and private caged areas may not be fully dedicated to the IaaS equipment provisioned for each customer. Cisco has the right to change the location of the data centers and will provide the customer with notification of any such changes. The co-location facility space will include:
Power
Cisco will ensure that each Cisco® data center is served by auxiliary backup generators capable of supplying backup power equal to 150 percent of the electricity needs of the Cisco data center. Such generators will be accompanied with a full Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) system interfacing with the utility and generator feeds.
Power will be provided to the servers maintained for the benefit of customer via a minimum of two (2) separate Power Distribution Units (PDUs).
Environmental controls
Cisco will ensure each Cisco data center is outfitted with a fully redundant HVAC system—maintaining temperature and humidity to industry data center standards. Each Cisco data center and all environmental systems therein will be monitored by staff 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year (24x7x365).
Fire detection and suppression
Cisco will ensure that each Cisco data center will be equipped with a fire detection and suppression system that meets industry data center standards. Such fire detection and suppression system(s) will be monitored by staff on a 24x7x365 basis.
Physical security and access
Cisco will ensure that each Cisco data center is and will continue to be provided with physical security and access protection that meets industry standards, such that access to each Cisco data center is limited to authorized personnel. Such physical security and access protection services will be provided on a 24x7x365 basis.
2. Logical security
Cisco maintains the environment provisioning process. To accomplish separation between clients Cisco will provision each client on its own VLAN. On the VLAN, the client will have access to the operating systems and applications built in the VLAN. Authentication will be managed by client’s own Active Directory.
3. Security responsibility
Following are diagrams that show where a customer’s and Cisco’s compliance responsibility areas are in order to obtain their respective certifications or attestations.
4. IaaS high availability and disaster recovery services
Customers can decide whether to run their IaaS applications in a geographically redundant manner or not. If a customer elects to run their IaaS applications in a single data center and connectivity to that data center goes down for any reason, the customer would not be able to access their IaaS applications until the data center comes back online.
For IaaS applications that run in a geographically redundant manner, Cisco will maintain the IaaS hardware such that every device is highly available within each of the Cisco data centers. Cisco will provide services on a continuously available basis by utilizing both data centers in production. Accordingly, at no time will both data centers be taken out of production at the same time.
Cisco agrees to maintain viable disaster recovery/business continuity plans for the IaaS services. Cisco will test, at least once every 12 months, plans to continue business and the provision of the IaaS services in the event of an interruption to the IaaS services or unavailability of any site from which IaaS services are being performed (the "disaster recovery/business continuity plans").
If an event interrupts Cisco's performance of any of the services, Cisco will promptly respond to such event in accordance with the procedures contained in the disaster recovery/business continuity plans in order to resume performance of such IaaS services as promptly as possible.
Customers that purchase the IaaS option will specify the compute resources, memory, and disk space required to meet the requirements of their applications and this infrastructure will be provided by Cisco. Customers will provide their own operating system and applications.

Getting started
Cisco reviews all candidate systems for functional and technical fit into the IaaS space. During this review, system architecture diagrams, data flow diagrams, ports and protocols, and bandwidth utilization must be made available.
It is most important that all interfaces that the Webex CCE IaaS interacts with are understood prior to electing to consume Webex CCE IaaS. Once those interfaces are understood, accommodations can be made for ensuring a supportable, maintainable, and reliable Webex CCE experience.
In order to provide any Support Services, the customer will provide the following information:
Device-related information:
●      Host names
●      IP addresses
