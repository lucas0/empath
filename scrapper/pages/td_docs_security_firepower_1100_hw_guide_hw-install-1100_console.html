Connect to the Console Port with Microsoft Windows
You must install a USB device driver the first time a Microsoft Windows-based PC is connected to the USB console port on the chassis, otherwise the connection fails.
To uninstall the driver, use the Add Remove Programs utility or the Setup-exe program.

Note
Disconnect the console terminal before uninstalling the driver.
Procedure
Step 1
Obtain the appropriate driver (Cisco_usbconsole_driver_X_X_zip, where X is a revision number) for your model from the Cisco Download Software site, USB Console Software category.
Note 
The download site redirects you to a router download section where the drivers are also applicable to Firepower products. The drivers are OS-specific and not tied to the vendor of the console cable manufacturer.
Step 2
Install the driver.
Step 3
Connect a 5-pin USB Mini B to the console port as shown in the following figure.

Step 4
Connect the end of the cable with the DB-9 connector (or USB Type A) to the terminal or PC. If your terminal or PC has a console port that does not accommodate a DB-9 connector, you must provide an appropriate adapter for that port.
The LED for the console port turns green and within a few moments the Found New Hardware Wizard appears.
Step 5
Follow the instructions to complete the driver installation.
Step 6
To communicate with the chassis, start a terminal emulator application. This software should be configured with the following parameters:
9600 baud
8 data bits
no parity
1 stop bit
no flow control
Connect to the Console Port with Mac OS X
Follow these steps to connect a Mac OS X system USB port to the console using the built-in OS X Terminal utility, or alternatively you can use a separate terminal emulator application.
Procedure
Step 1
Use the Finder to go to Applications > Utilities > Terminal.
Step 2
Connect the OS X USB port to the chassis.
Step 3
Enter the following commands to find the OS X USB port number:
Example:
macbook:user$ cd /dev
macbook:user$ ls -ltr /dev/*usb*
crw-rw-rw- 1 root wheel 9, 66 Apr 1 16:46 tty.usbmodem1a21
DT-macbook:dev user$
Step 4
Connect to the USB port with the following command followed by the chassis USB port speed:
Example:
macbook:user$ screen /dev/tty.usbmodem1a21 9600
Step 5
Enter Ctrl-a followed by d to disconnect the OS X USB console from the Terminal window.
Connect to the Console Port with Linux
Follow these steps to connect a Linux system USB port to the console using the built-in Linux Terminal utility.
Procedure
Step 1
Open the Linux Terminal window.
Step 2
Connect the Linux USB port to the chassis.
Step 3
Enter the following commands to find the Linux USB port number:
Example:
root@usb-suse# cd /dev
root@usb-suse /dev# ls -ltr *ACM*
crw-r--r-- 1 root root 188, 0 Jan 14 18:02 ttyACM0
root@usb-suse /dev#
Step 4
Connect to the USB port with the following command followed by the chassis USB port speed
Example:
root@usb-suse /dev# screen /dev/ttyACM0 9600
Step 5
To disconnect the Linux USB console from the Terminal window, enter Ctrl-a followed by : then quit.
