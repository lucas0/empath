Cisco Learning Credits
How to Accept Terms and Conditions
A Team Captain must accept the Terms and Conditions (T&C) on behalf of their company to activate their account and receive CLC awards. The company will be eligible for CLC awards in the Cisco fiscal quarter following their acceptance.
Follow these steps to accept the Terms and Conditions:
Log into Learning Credit Management Tool (LCMT) using your cisco.com CCOID credentials.
Note: If you have not already accepted the Loyalty Terms and Conditions, you will be automatically re-directed to the signature page.
From the top right of the page, click the T&C icon. The Program Terms page will display.
Click CLC T&C and Loyalty Program T&C to read the terms and conditions.
In the Actions column, click the checkbox to select the account(s).
Click Accept to agree to the terms and conditions for both CLCs and the Loyalty Program for the selected accounts.
Your Cisco Customer Loyalty Program account will become active. You will be eligible to receive awards in the next Cisco fiscal quarter, access your Customer Loyalty Program account, and view or approve transactions.
