Product Description
The ONS 15216-MD-ID-50 is a C-band 50 GHz/100 GHz module that operates inside the patch panel. The ONS 15216-MD-ID-50 module interfaces between the 15216-MD-40-ODD and 15216-MD-40-EVEN patch panels, and 80 channels of wavelengths. The advantages of installing the C-band 50 GHz/100 GHz module is as follows:
•Extends existing network capacity
•Provides low cost future proofing of network capacity
•Allows for non-traffic affecting capacity upgrade, when the patch panel is equipped with the ONS 15216-MD-ID-50 module at first installation.
Features
The ONS 15216-MD-ID-50 is a modular component that provides signal interleaving and de-interleaving in 50 GHz channel spacing DWDM systems. It is optically and electrically passive and requires no temperature control. It uses fused fiber coupler technologies and a birefringent crystal technology platform.
The operating features of the ONS 15216-MD-ID-50 module include:
•Low dispersion
•Low insertion loss
•High channel isolation
•Wide clear bandwidth
•Full C-band coverage
•Interleave and Deinterleave 80-channels
•Athermal design
Functional Description
The ONS 15216-MD-ID-50 module increases the network capacity by combining two optical data streams into a single, more densely spaced stream. This module can be used in mux mode to combine two 100 GHz optical signal streams into one 50 GHz stream, or in demux mode to separate the 50 GHz stream into two 100 GHz streams.
The ONS 15216-MD-ID-50 is a bidirectional module in which the mux and demux functions are implemented in two different sections to enable signals flowing in opposite directions to be managed separately. This functionality is illustrated in Figure 1.
Figure 1 Functional Description of the Interleaver and Deinterleaver Module
The interleaver in the mux section combines the even and odd channel signals at 100 GHz spacing (EVEN-RX and ODD-RX ports, respectively) into the 50 GHz channel spacing signal.
The deinterleaver in the demux section separates the 50 GHz channel spacing signal into even and odd channel signals of 100 GHz spacing (EVEN-TX and ODD-TX ports, respectively).
The interleaver and deinterleaver module is plugged inside the patch panel and is interconnected with another patch panel of a different grid.
Optical Interconnections
The optical interconnections between the odd patch panel, interleaver and deinterleaver module and the even patch panel is shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2 Patch Panel Interconnection with Interleaver and Deinterleaver Module
The port connections between the odd patch panel, interleaver and deinterleaver module, and the even patch panel are established as follows:
•COM-TX port of the odd patch panel and ODD-RX port of the interleaver and deinterleaver module.
•COM-RX port of the odd patch panel and ODD-TX port of the interleaver and deinterleaver module.
•COM-TX port of the even patch panel and EVEN-RX port of the interleaver and deinterleaver module.
•COM-RX port of the even patch panel and EVEN-TX port of the interleaver and deinterleaver module.

Fiber-Optic Connector Cleaning and Maintenance
Connector cleaning is required to maintain the performance of fiber-optic circuits. It is important that both the LC/UPC connector at the end of the fiber-optic cable and the mating bulkhead adapter on the front panel of the patch panel are clean before the connection is made.
Warning Invisible laser radiation may be emitted from disconnected fibers or connectors. Do not stare into beams or view directly with optical instruments. Statement 1051
The following warning applies to disposal of chemicals and other materials used to clean connectors and adapters:
Warning Ultimate disposal of this product should be handled according to all national laws and regulations. Statement 1040
Note Before installing the fiber-optic cable, always perform the cleaning procedure for cable connectors described in the following section. Whenever possible, inspect each connector before connecting it to the mating bulkhead adapter on the front panel.
Note The LC bulkhead adapters on the ONS 15216-ID-50 front panel are less likely to get dirty if they are capped when not in use. Because the procedure for a thorough cleaning of these adapters is complicated and involves opening the patch panel, Cisco recommends that you use a commercially available cleaning kit and closely follow the instructions included with the kit. Only a simple, routine cleaning procedure for these adapters that can be easily performed by the customer is described here.
Customer Supplied Cleaning Materials
The Type A fiber optic connector cleaners (for example, CLETOP reel) are recommended to clean the cable connectors, but are not supplied with the patch panel.
When cleaning a paired cable connector (bulkhead mating adapter), always clean the mating adapter first.
If properly maintained (only used with clean, defect-free fiber connectors and capped when not in use), the mating adapter would not require cleaning. However, if you suspect the adapter is dirty, clean it by using the CLETOP stick swab.
Note For multi-fiber cable assemblies, use specific cleaning tools or materials designed for the assembly type.
Clean the Bulkhead Mating Adapters
Step 1 Read the manufacturer (cleaning cartridge) instructions to insert the cartridge cleaning tip into the mating adapter.
Step 2 Slide the lever on the cartridge to swipe the mating surface.
Note Always keep unused adapter ports and fiber connectors capped with a clean dust cap.
Clean Fiber-Optic Cable Connectors
The tools required to clean fiber connectors are:
•Inspection microscope
•Type A Fiber Optic Connector Cleaner (CLETOP reel)
•Optical swab
•Optical receiver cleaning stick
Step 1 Using an inspection microscope, inspect each fiber connector for dirt, cracks, or scratches.
Step 2 Replace any damaged fiber connectors.
Note Replace all dust caps whenever the equipment is unused for 30 minutes or more.
Caution Do not reuse optical swabs. Keep unused swabs off of work surfaces.
Step 3 Clean the fiber connectors with CLETOP reel:
a. Remove the dust cap from the fiber connector.
b. Press the lever down to open the shutter door. Each time you press the lever, you expose a clean wiping surface.
c. Insert the connector into the CLETOP cleaning cassette slot, rotate one quarter turn, and gently swipe downwards.
d. Use an inspection microscope to inspect each fiber connector for dirt, cracks, or scratches. If the connector is not clean, repeat Steps a to b.
e. Insert the fiber connector into the applicable adapter or attach a dust cap to the fiber connector.
Note If you must replace a dust cap on a connector, first verify that the dust cap is clean. To clean the dust cap, wipe the outside of the cap using a dry, lint-free wipe and the inside of the dust cap using a CLETOP stick swab (14100400).
Install and Route Fiber-Optic Cables
Warning Invisible laser radiation may be emitted from disconnected fibers or connectors. Do not stare into beams or view directly with optical instruments. Statement 1051
Caution When connecting an optical fiber patch cord between the patch panel and the optical card ports in the ONS 15454, use the electrostatic discharge wristband supplied with the ONS 15454. Plug the wristband into the ESD jack on the lower right front side of the ONS 15454.
Note Always clean all fiber connectors thoroughly before making the connection with the mating adapter. Very small particles can permanently damage the end of the mating fiber inside the patch panel, which makes regular cleaning imperative. For cleaning instructions see "Fiber-Optic Connector Cleaning and Maintenance" section.
Note The interleaver and deinterleaver module features LC/UPC bulkhead adapters. Always use fiber-optic cables equipped with the corresponding (LC/UPC) connector type. Using any other type of connector results in damage to the connector and/or adapter.
Step 1 Place the LC/UPC cable connector in front of the corresponding bulkhead adapter on the front panel of the patch panel.
Step 2 Align the keyed ridge of the cable connector with the slot in the receiving adapter.
Step 3 Gently push the cable connector into the adapter until you hear a click, which indicates that the latching system is engaged.
Step 4 Route the fiber cables through the left or right fiber bend radius controller and secure them into place closing the cable retention clip. (See Figure 8.)
Uninstalling the Module
This procedure describes the steps for removing the interleaver and deinterleaver module from the patch panel.
Step 1 Open the front panel of the patch panel.
To open the front panel, follow the instructions in Step 1 of the "Install the Interleaver and Deinterleaver Module" section. (See Figure 3.)
Step 2 Extract the internal drawer of the patch panel.
To extract the internal drawer, follow the instructions in Step 2 of the "Install the Interleaver and Deinterleaver Module" section. (See Figure 4 and Figure 5.)
Step 3 Open the cable retention clip of the fiber bend radius controller on the appropriate side of the patch panel. (See Figure 8.)

1 Adjacent Channel Isolation is defined as the difference between the maximum IL in the 50 GHz transmitted channel Bandwidth (ITU ± 80 pm) and the minimum IL measured over the Operating Wavelength Bandwidth (± 80 pm, centered on each ITU wavelength of the channel) of both adjacent 100 GHz channels.
2 Adjacent Channel Isolation is defined as the difference between the maximum IL in the 50 GHz transmitted channel Bandwidth (ITU ± 80 pm) and the minimum IL measured over the Operating Wavelength Bandwidth of both adjacent 100 GHz channels.
3 The Insertion Loss values are measured as the maximum IL inside the Operating Wavelength Bandwidth.
4 Insertion Loss Uniformity is defined as the difference between the maximum insertion losses over any two operating wavelength bandwidths.
5 The difference between the maximum and minimum group delay in the Operating Wavelength Bandwidth of each channel evaluated at all SOP.
6 Chromatic Dispersion is defined as the maximum of derivative of the Group Delay versus the wavelength curve in the 50 GHz transmitted channel bandwidth (Operating Wavelength Bandwidth)
7 PDL (Polarization Dependent Loss) is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum IL in the 100 GHz transmitted channel Bandwidth (Operating Wavelength Bandwidth) evaluated at all SOP, measured at a given wavelength.
8 PMD (Polarization Mode Dispersion) is defined as the maximum of the DGD versus the wavelength curve in the 50 GHz transmitted channel bandwidth (Operating Wavelength Bandwidth).
