This document provides information about Crosswork Data Gateway 4.1, including features, compatibility information, known issues and limitations.

Attention
Crosswork Data Gateway 4.1 supports deployment with Crosswork on-premise applications only. To deploy Crosswork Data Gateway with Crosswork Cloud applications, you must use Crosswork Data Gateway 4.0.
Product Overview
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway is a model-driven scalable data collection platform that enables real-time data collection from multiprotocol capable devices, thereby reducing the need for multiple collection points for multiple applications requiring data from the network.
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway is not a standalone product and is expected to be used with Crosswork applications. There is no separate software license required for Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway. Use of Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway to forward data to third-party destinations is only supported when using the Crosswork Data Gateway with Crosswork on-premise applications and requires a separate license.
What's New
This section lists the features delivered in Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway 4.1.

Note
Starting with the Crosswork Data Gateway 4.1 release, Crosswork Data Gateway deployment is no longer supported for the Cisco CSP platform. We recommend that users with Crosswork Data Gateway deployments on Cisco CSP consider migrating the deployments to the supported data centers. For more information, see End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco Cloud Services Platform Operating System.

Compatibility Information
Crosswork Data Gateway 4.1 supports deployment with Crosswork on-premise applications only.
The following table shows software requirements for the supported virtualization platforms along with the physical and network resource requirements needed to support the Crosswork Data Gateway.

Note
The values shown in the table are the defaults which we recommended using. Deviations from these values should not be made unless you are working with Cisco to determine the unique requirements of your deployment.
Crosswork Data Gateway 4.1 VM Requirements for Crosswork on-premise applications
Crosswork Data Gateway supports the following profiles for deployment with Crosswork on-premise applications:
On-Premise Standard (default): To deploy Crosswork Data Gateway with all Crosswork on-premise applications except Crosswork Health Insights and Crosswork Service Health.
On-Premise Extended: To deploy Crosswork Data Gateway when Crosswork Health Insights and Crosswork Service Health are installed.

Attention
The On-Premise Standard with Extra Resources profile is available as a limited-availability feature and must not be used while deploying Crosswork Data Gateway in your data center. Please contact the Cisco Customer Experience team for assistance.
Table 2. Crosswork Data Gateway 4.1 VM Requirements for Crosswork on-premise applications
Requirement
Description
Data Center
VMware
VMware vSphere 6.7 or above.
VMware vCenter Server 7.0, ESXi 7.0 or later installed on hosts.
VMware vCenter Server 6.7 (Update 3g or later), ESXi 6.7 Update 1 installed on hosts.
Amazon EC2
Crosswork Data Gateway deployment and operations have been validated on the current publicly available Amazon platform.
For memory, vCPUs, and storage requirements for the data center, see Section: Cisco Crosswork Installation Requirements in the Cisco Crosswork Infrastructure 4.4 and Applications Installation Guide.
Interfaces
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 3
Crosswork Data Gateway can be deployed with either 1, 2, or 3 interfaces as per the combinations below:
Note 
If you use one interface on your Crosswork cluster, you must use only one interface on the Crosswork Data Gateway. If you use two interfaces on your Crosswork Cluster, then you can use two or three interfaces on the Crosswork Data Gateway as per your network requirements.

Management Traffic
Control/Data Traffic
Device Access Traffic
Management traffic: for accessing the Interactive Console and passing the Control/Data information between servers (for example, a Crosswork application to Crosswork Data Gateway).
Control/Data traffic: for data and configuration transfer between Crosswork Data Gateway and Crosswork applications and other external data destinations.
Device access traffic: for device access and data collection.
Note 
Due to security policies, traffic from subnets of a vNIC received on other vNICs is dropped. For example, in a 3 vNIC model setup, all device traffic (incoming and outgoing) must be routed through vNIC2. Crosswork Data Gateway drops device traffic received over vNIC0 and vNIC1.
IP Addresses
1 or 2 IPv4 or IPv6 addresses based on the number of interfaces you choose to use. Including one additional IP address to be used as the Virtual IP (VIP) address.
Note 
Crosswork does not support dual stack configurations. Therefore, ALL addresses for the environment must be either IPv4 or IPv6.
In a 3- NIC deployment, you will need to provide an IP address for Management interface (vNIC0) and Control/Data interface (vNIC1) only during installation. A virtual IP address for Device Access Traffic (vNIC2) is assigned when you create a Crosswork Data Gateway pool as explained in the Section: Create a Crosswork Data Gateway Pool in the Cisco Crosswork Infrastructure 4.4 and Applications Administration Guide.
NTP Servers
The IPv4 or IPv6 addresses or host names of the NTP servers you plan to use. If you want to enter multiple NTP servers, separate them with spaces. These should be the same NTP servers you use to synchronize devices, clients, and servers across your network. Verify that the NTP IP address or host name is reachable on the network or installation will fail.
Also, the ESXi hosts that will run the Crosswork application and Crosswork Data Gateway VM must have NTP configured, or the initial handshake may fail with "certificate not valid" errors.
DNS Servers
The IPv4 or IPv6 addresses of the DNS servers you plan to use. These should be the same DNS servers you use to resolve host names across your network. Confirm that the DNS servers are reachable on the network before attempting installation. The installation will fail if the servers cannot be reached.
DNS Search Domain
The search domain you want to use with the DNS servers, for example, cisco.com. You can have only one search domain.
(optional) Proxy Server
URL of an optional management network proxy server if your environment.
If your environment requires an HTTP or HTTPS proxy in order to access URLs on the public Internet, you must configure a proxy server in order for the Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway to successfully connect to Cisco Crosswork
(optional) Syslog Sever
The hostname or IPv4 or IPv6 address of an external syslog server.
(optional) Auditd Server
The hostname or IPv4 or IPv6 address of an external auditd server.
