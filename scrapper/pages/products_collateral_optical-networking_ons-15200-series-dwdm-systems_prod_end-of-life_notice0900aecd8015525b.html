The ONS 15216 EDFA3 is a 1-RU rack-mountable EDFA with TL1 and SNMP management and Cisco Transport Manager support. It has mid-amplifier access for placement of a dispersion-compensating module (DCM) for enhanced 10-Gbps and 2.5-Gbps network support. The Cisco ONS 15216 EDFA3 has a low-noise-figure gain block with true variable gain, which gives superior optical performance and allows longer system reach before the requirement for regeneration.
