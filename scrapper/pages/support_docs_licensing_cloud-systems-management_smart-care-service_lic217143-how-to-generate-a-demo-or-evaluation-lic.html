Introduction
The article describes a process of generating a non-Smart demo license since the Smart license normally includes the evaluation mode be default. If you need additional demo or evaluation license for Smart Account, you can reach out to the Accounts team or Point of Sales. Every new Identity Services Engine (ISE) installation has 90-day free evaluation (trial) licenses for up to 100 endpoints for all ISE services. Trial licenses may be extended by adding another 90-day evaluation license. 
Note: If you need to extend your evaluation license for more than 90 days or more than 100 endpoints, then open a case in Support Case Manager (SCM) and provide the unique device identifier (UDI) and justification.
Caution: Additional licenses cannot be generated without the unique device identifiers (UDIs) for your ISE Administration node(s). Failure to include the primary and secondary ISE policy administration node (PAN) results in delays in getting your licenses.

Before you start, ensure that you have the following data at your disposal:
