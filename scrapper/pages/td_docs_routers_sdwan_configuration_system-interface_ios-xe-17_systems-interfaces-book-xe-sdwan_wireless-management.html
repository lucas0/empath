Prerequisites for Wireless Management on Cisco ISR 1000 Series Routers
Add the management interface of the Wireless LAN (WLAN) module to a specific VLAN in order to access servers such as DHCP and RADIUS.
Configure a DHCP server to assign the IP address for the access point.
Configure a switch virtual interface (SVI) on the Cisco ISR 1000 Services Router for virtual WLAN controller management.
Restrictions for Wireless Management on Cisco ISR 1000 Series Routers
You can configure only one access point on the LAN side of the router that is configured with Cisco Mobility Express. However, you can connect other external access points to the router that are not configured with Cisco Mobility Express.
Ensure that there are no other accessible wireless controllers on the LAN side.

Troubleshooting Wireless Configuration on Cisco ISR 1000 Series Routers
Access Point Cannot Connect to Cisco Mobility Express or EWC
Access Point Cannot Connect to Cisco Mobility Express or EWC
Problem
An access point is not able to connect to the Cisco Mobility Express or EWC.
Possible Causes
This problem is most likely to occur when there is no DCHP server in the management VLAN (the native VLAN of interface Wlan-GigabitEthernet).
Solution
Add the management interface of the WLAN module to a specific VLAN in order to access servers like DHCP and RADIUS. See Prerequisites for Wireless Management on Cisco ISR 1000 Series Routers
A DHCP server is required in the native VLAN of the WiFi module to assign IP address for the access point. Without IP address, the access point will not able to connect to Cisco Mobility Express or EWC.
