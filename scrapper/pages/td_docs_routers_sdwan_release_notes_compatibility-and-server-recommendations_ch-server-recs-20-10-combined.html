To achieve scale beyond the numbers mentioned in the tables above, deploy multiple overlays.

Note
The number of days the data can be stored in Cisco vManage, depends on per-day processing volume of the device nodes. To store the data for a longer time or to accommodate the increase in per-day processing volume, use the following formulas to calculate the required Cisco vManage disk size:
Formula to calculate the Cisco vManage disk size required for single node deployment: (Data per day × number of days) + 500 GB buffer . For example, if the data per day is 100 Gigabytes and the number of days the data must be stored is 10, then the required Cisco vManage disk size is 1.5 Terabytes.
Formula to calculate the Cisco vManage disk size required for cluster deployment: (Data per day × number of days × 3) + 500 GB buffer . For example, if the data per day is 100 Gigabytes, the number of days the data must be stored is 10, then the required Cisco vManage disk size is 3.5 Terabytes.

Note
Maximum tested disk size for On-prem is 10 TB per instance.

Note
Starting from Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, you can achieve the above mentioned storage size numbers by modifying the aggregated SAIE size. The aggregated SAIE size is unidimensional and varies when the deployment includes edge devices that run on a mix of releases (Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.6.x and earlier releases). The aggregated SAIE also varies when on-demand troubleshooting is enabled for the devices.
Ensure that both the SAIE and aggregated SAIE index sizes are configured to enable on-demand troubleshooting.
To modify the aggregated SAIE value,
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Administration > Settings.
Click Edit next to Statistics Database Configuration.
Modify the Aggregated SAIE size to the desired value based on your SAIE traffic, the default disk size allocation is 5 GB.

Note
When SAIE is enabled, you must set the Statistics Collection timer to 30 minutes or higher.
To set the Statistics Collection timer,
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Administration > Settings.
Click Edit next to Statistics Configuration.
Modify the Collection Interval minutes to the desired value based on your SAIE traffic, the default collection interval is 30 minutes.
Click Save.

Note
The tested and recommended limit of supported Cisco vBond Orchestrator instances in a single Cisco SD-WAN overlay are eight, similarly the maximum number of tested vSmart instances is twelve.
The required number of vCPUs and RAM for Cisco vBond Orchestrators and Cisco vSmart Controllers for Cisco Cloud Hosted overlays are determined by the Cisco Cloud Ops and provisioned accordingly.
The number of Cisco vSmart and Cisco vBond instances recommended in the table above assumes a deployment with Cisco SD-WAN controllers in two locations (i.e. data centers) designed for redundancy – with half the controllers in one data center and half the controllers in another data center. In other words, the table above already considers the 1:1 redundancy in the number of Cisco vSmart and Cisco vBond instances recommended to be deployed across the two data centers – without considering any Cisco vSmart controller group/affinity configuration.
If you are deploying Cisco vSmart and Cisco vBond instances with a different set of assumptions, for example, across three data centers, or if you are using Cisco vSmart controller groups/affinity within your deployment, refer to the Points to Consider chapter for additional guidance.

Note
A pair of Cisco vSmart Controllers supports 24 tenants and 1000 devices across all the tenants. For example, 24 tenants require 2 vSmart Controllers, 50 tenants require 6 vSmart Controllers, and 150 tenants require 14 vSmart Controllers.
The SAIE numbers are for the entire multi-tenant (cluster) deployment and there is no per tenant SAIE limitation.
If SAIE is enabled, we recommend that the aggregated SAIE data (across all Cisco vManage nodes and all tenants in the multitenant system) does not exceed 350 GB per day. If the SAIE data exceeds 350 GB per day, increase the Hard Disk capacity of each Cisco vManage node up to 10 TB.
A pair of Cisco vSmart Controllers supports 24 tenants and 1000 devices across all tenants.
A tenant can add a maximum of 1000 devices.
The tested and recommended limit of supported Cisco vBond Orchestrator instances in a single Cisco SD-WAN overlay is eight.
