Why is security resilience important?
Uncertainty has become the new normal. Because change is coming faster than ever, businesses are making massive investments across the enterprise to strengthen resilience. From financial resilience to operations resilience and organizational resilience to supply chain resilience, these initiatives are designed to help businesses operate as they adapt to change. Because security cuts through every aspect of these initiatives, the investments will fall short if businesses do not also invest in security resilience.
What is driving the need for security resilience?
Security resilience must deal with a new, interconnected world. Businesses are operating as integrated ecosystems where boundaries between corporations, customers, suppliers, and partners all blur. Additionally, connections between people, devices, and data are ever-expanding with billions of touchpoints. Meanwhile, businesses are adjusting to constantly shifting work patterns, as hybrid work is here to stay.
What questions should I be asking about security resilience?
A focus on resilience has supercharged security concerns and raised tough questions for today's executives, including:
Which threats matter most to us right now?
Do we have the visibility to detect these threats?
Where are we most exposed to risk?
If (or when) we do get breached, how fast can we recover? 
How are we making measurable progress and getting stronger every day?
The most important thing to remember is that when everything is open and connected, security resilience requires more than past approaches to security offered.
Businesses must adopt a new security strategy. It is time to move away from stand-alone security—which is focused on siloed threat prevention and treating all alerts and threats equally—and toward security resilience that focuses on detection, response, and recovery.
