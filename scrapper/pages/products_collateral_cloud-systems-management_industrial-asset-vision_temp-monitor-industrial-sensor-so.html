    Monitoring food temperature: A critical requirement for food safety
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has shifted its focus from responding to foodborne illnesses to preventing them. Toward that end, the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) has been enacted. One of the crucial compliance requirements in Title 21 is to control the temperatures of food being processed to an acceptable range. There is also a need to record such temperature information for audits and to identify Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP).
Food products are perishable, and ineffective temperature control, especially for cold chain environments, can lead to loss of product. Bacteria and other pathogens grow at certain temperature ranges and keeping food temperatures out of that range is crucial. Food waste on account of spoilage is costly.
Other concerns are food quality and taste repeatability. In several food types, fluctuations in temperature can lead to changes in the taste and quality of the final product, which will impact revenues.
Temperature control is required in many different environments — for example, in external freezers, mobile freezer trailers, storage vats and processors, fluid suspensions, open outdoor areas, etc.
Benefits
Improve food safety and quality by:
●      Monitoring outside and indoor ambient temperature and humidity, including cold and refrigerated spaces
●      Monitoring machine and fluid temperature
●      Tracing temperature changes due to doors being left open
●      Logging temperature data for HACCP analysis
●      Providing temperature data to other systems
Drive operational equipment efficiency with:
●      Easy one-click and “no wiring” installation of sensors
●      Decrease equipment downtime
Key requirements
When organizations attempt to deploy a modern Internet of Things (IoT) temperature monitoring solution, they need to address numerous constraints. A temperature monitoring system has four primary requirements:
●      Extensive coverage: Manufacturers often don’t have a single solution that works for the entire plant and any logistics areas next to the plant. The range of a solution and its suitability for different environments is key. The need for temperature sensors to send readings through different building barriers adds to the coverage challenge. Existing solutions often fail to meet current needs, as buildout of plants happens over time, and changes to the plant layout can leave gaps in the temperature coverage.
●      Simplicity and flexibility: Temperature measurement points need to be changed or added, and in some cases new environments need to be addressed to ensure robust HACCP compliance. Operations managers need the flexibility to add new measurement points quickly and easily, without involving their IT teams and plant electrical maintenance teams.
●      Low maintenance: Maintenance activities such as changing sensor batteries should be simple and as infrequent as possible. The longer the battery life, the better. Temperature sensors need to be recalibrated often to maintain compliance. So swapping out, reinstalling sensors, and adding new sensors should be seamless.
●      Standard integration: Temperature data that is not available to other applications has limited use. Data needs to be retained and shared across different systems to enable effective control.

Food processing plant deployment
Let’s look at how we can deploy Cisco Industrial Asset Vision for temperature monitoring in a food processing plant. Addressing key requirements and building a secure industrial temperature monitoring system is easily done with Industrial Asset Vision.
Figure 3 presents an example of a plant that makes apple pies.
The process covers:
●      Initial receiving of materials and storing them in temperature-controlled spaces or freezer environments
●      Washing and grading the material, blanching and filling it into dough shells, and then baking the pies in an oven
●      Cooling and packaging
●      Storing the products in a finished goods inventory under optimal temperature conditions

The process has numerous stages and can cover a large footprint from receiving to finished goods inventory.
Industrial Asset Vision sensors
●      Temperature, humidity sensors – outdoor IP67, indoor
●      Machine and fluid temperature sensors
●      Refrigerated space sensors
●      Ingress and egress sensors
●      Water leak sensor
●      Vibration sensor
●      Industrial sensor bridge
Temperature monitoring
Temperature sensors can be deployed at any point in the process, indoors or outdoors, measuring ambient temperature and humidity or fluid or machine temperature. In the process illustrated above, sensors are shown at storage locations, refrigerated locations, wash stations, oven cooling belts, and many other areas.
Door monitoring
Refrigerated spaces can suffer severe temperature fluctuations if an access door has been left ajar. This can be addressed by easily mounting an ingress/egress sensor on any access points of a refrigerated space and generating an alarm if a door is left open. Access counts can also be analyzed to drive efficiency improvements.
Vibration monitoring
Impending machine failure happens. Extend the life of your equipment by detecting changes in your machine’s movement or vibration, before failure occurs. The vibration sensor enables preventative maintenance and enhances worker safety by measuring acceleration, velocity, displacement, and other statistical derivations. When attached to water pumps, motors, or even industrial compressors in this facility, the sensor may detect any misalignment or misbalance that may impact product quality or compromise the safety of workers.
Industrial Sensor Bridge
For complete visibility, data from existing third-party sensors can be collected using the new Industrial Sensor Bridge, and monitored in the IoT Operations Dashboard. This enables workers to have the ability to view data, including anything from tank levels in manufacturing facilities to the number of pallets in their warehouses, and to combine this with the environmental and facility data collected from other industrial sensors. This sensor allows for almost anything imaginable to be measured including air quality, pressure, metering and more.
Complete campus coverage
With the Cisco Wireless Gateway for LoRaWAN (IXM gateway), the entire plant campus can be covered with just a few gateways. For redundancy, additional gateways can be deployed. Once the gateways are deployed, sensors can be installed anywhere in the plant, in the warehouse, or on the campus.
Signal access and range
The IXM gateway operates in the unlicensed Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) frequencies, specifically around the 800- to 900-MHz bands. Radio waves at these frequencies have excellent structure penetration capabilities.
This brings two distinct advantages:
●      Sensors can be deployed in indoor rooms and outdoor locations without significant signal attenuation.
●      The signals can be picked up at long distances, providing extensive coverage with fewer gateways, thus reducing the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of the solution.
Solution introduction and operation
Industrial Asset Vision supports IT and Operations Team (OT) requirements. IT users can easily install the IXM gateways, provide connectivity, and onboard OT users. Following gateway installation, adding and moving sensors is a very simple OT-driven process. This enables the plant operations staff to perform their temperature monitoring activities without IT support.
Adding and moving sensors
Industrial Asset Vision provides a mobile app that automates all the process steps of bringing a sensor online. An operator only needs to identify the area where the sensor is installed, give the sensor a name, and perform the installation with the equipment provided. A sensor can be brought online or swapped within a couple of minutes. Sensors may also be integrated with existing third-party sensors using the sensor bridge, just as easily.
Sensor calibration is very simple. The Industrial Asset Vision dashboard supports a one-click sensor swap.
Sensors include batteries that have an expected lifetime of up to 5 years. Low battery alerts are presented on the dashboard for easy identification. Battery swap does not need any special tools or training.
Monitoring and operations dashboard
Industrial Asset Vision has a built-in cloud-based operations dashboard to provide holistic and actionable insights into assets and facilities. Drill-down menus for assets, sensors, alerts, and networks help both OT and IT staff quickly see the status and health of devices, as well as to resolve issues through a comprehensive troubleshooting capability. Users can also set alerts or generate reports to receive notifications so that they can better service their facilities and equipment.
Data integrations
Industrial Asset Vision provides out-of-the-box functionality to publish data to a customer’s cloud provider or internal business systems. Cisco Industrial Asset Vision is a module in IoT Operations Dashboard, which enables operations teams to manage the industrial edge easily, securely and at scale. Additionally, a rich API interface can be used to retrieve asset and telemetry data. Data can be integrated with business analytics platforms for logging and cataloging along with other batch/process state and telemetry data.
Industrial Asset Vision supports collecting data for HACCP activity and long-term process improvements. The temperature-logging capability can provide data for building traceability reports.
