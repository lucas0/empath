Objective
The FindIT Network Probe generates notifications when events occur in the network. It may be in the form of an email or a pop-up at the bottom-right corner of the FindIT Probe home window. Notifications are color-coded for ease of use.
Green indicates a Minor event.
Orange indicates a Major event.
Red indicates a Critical event.
The Notification Center is represented by a Bell icon at the top-right corner of the FindIT Network Probe window. It may have a number over it, which represents the total number of unacknowledged notifications. The color of the number indicates the nature of the event as enumerated above. All notifications are logged for future review. Notifications can also be customized to show only the logs of your preference.
This article aims to show you how to manage the notifications on the FindIT Network Probe. It also assumes that you have already configured the email settings at the Administration > Email Settings area of the FindIT Network Probe.
