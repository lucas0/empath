IP Foundation for Broadcast Engineers (CCIPFM) v2.0
What you’ll learn in this course
The IP Foundation for Broadcast Engineers (CCIPFM) v2.0 course introduces you to Internet Protocol (IP) networking and the Cisco® IP Fabric for Media (IPFM) solution. You will learn how to migrate from Serial Digital Interface (SDI)-based deployments to an IP-based infrastructure, as well as the basic principles of IP technologies including: Ethernet functions and standards, Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) stack, and Cisco IPFM deployment. Through a combination of lessons and hands-on labs, you will explore the Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) Media Controller, including deploying and troubleshooting the DCNM Media Controller to manage and automate flows through the fabric and configure basic IP functionality.
