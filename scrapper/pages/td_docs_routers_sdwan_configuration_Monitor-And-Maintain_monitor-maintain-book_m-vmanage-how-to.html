Syslog Messages
Permanent Alarms and Alarm Fields
Syslog Messages
The tables below list the syslog messages generated by Cisco vEdge devices and Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. The messages are grouped based on the software module that generates them. The software modules are typically processes (daemons) that run on the device.
All syslog messages are generated on all the devices unless otherwise indicated.
Each syslog message has a corresponding number. The tables list all syslog messages and their number even if the messages are defined in the header files but are not currently used in the operating software. For these messages, the Message Format, Description, and Action fields are empty.
In these tables, the Action field indicates the recommended action you should take in response to the syslog message:
A—Automatically open a ticket in your organization's support team.
AE—Automatically open a support ticket and escalate the ticket
E—Send email to the appropriate team within your organization.
If you see a syslog message that is not listed in one of the tables below, please send the message, along with the device and software version, to Cisco support.
