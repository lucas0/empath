Hybrid work is here to stay

Transform your workplace
Put security first
Hybrid work comes with its own security risks. 
Hybrid teams and remote experts rely on personal computers, routers, and mobile devices that can be difficult to manage and secure. Look for security solutions that:
Provide flexible, cloud-delivered security. 
Protect data by verifying the identity of users, devices, and applications.
Detect and block cyberattacks from email.
Optimize your hybrid operations
How do you ensure that your hybrid teams can communicate effectively, stay connected to suppliers, monitor operations, and support remote experts, all from home?
Make it easy for your workers to meet, collaborate, and share with a virtual workspace that captures all the information needed to continue operations. Look for a solution that:
Offers secure exchange of messages and files across devices.
Makes it easy to search for conversations and documents.
Allows you to privately message one person or create a group chat in seconds.
Simplify, simplify, simplify
Over half of manufacturers cite team collaboration solutions, device management, and security as areas of investment needed to enable a hybrid workforce.
If you don’t have a large IT team, you may be worried that getting your hybrid teams connected will be complicated. But it doesn’t have to be. To reduce IT complexity, look for solutions that:
Integrate meetings, calling, and security. 
Are cloud-based and easy for employees to deploy without onsite IT.
Are simple to manage.
