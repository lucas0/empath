General Node Settings
The following table describes the fields on the General Settings window of a Cisco ISE node. In this window, you can assign a persona to a node and configure the services to be run on it. The navigation path for this window is: Administration > System > Deployment > Deployment Node > Edit > General Settings.
Table 1. General Node Settings
Field Name Usage Guidelines
Hostname Displays the hostname of the Cisco ISE node.
FQDN Displays the fully qualified domain name of the Cisco ISE node. For example, ise1.cisco.com.
IP Address Displays the IP address of the Cisco ISE node.
Node Type Displays the node type.
Personas
Administration
Check this check box if you want a Cisco ISE node to assume the Administration persona. You can enable the Administration persona only on nodes that are licensed to provide the administrative services.
Role: Displays the role that the Administration persona has assumed in the deployment. Could take on any one of the following values: Standalone, Primary, Secondary
Make Primary: Click this button to make this node your primary Cisco ISE node. You can have only one primary Cisco ISE node in a deployment. The other options on this page will become active only after you make this node primary. You can have only two Administration nodes in a deployment. If the node has a Standalone role, a Make Primary button appears next to it.If the node has a Secondary role, a Promote to Primary button appears next to it.If the node has a Primary role and there are no other nodes registered with it, a Make Standalone button appears next to it. You can click this button to make your primary node a standalone node.
Monitoring
Check this check box if you want a Cisco ISE node to assume the Monitoring persona and function as your log collector. There must be at least one Monitoring node in a distributed deployment. At the time of configuring your Primary PAN, you must enable the Monitoring persona. After you register a secondary Monitoring node in your deployment, you can edit the Primary PAN and disable the Monitoring persona, if required. To configure a Cisco ISE node on a VMware platform as your log collector, use the following guidelines to determine the minimum amount of disk space that you need: 180 KB per endpoint in your network, per day 2.5 MB per Cisco ISE node in your network, per day.
You can calculate the maximum disk space that you need based on how many months of data you want to have in your Monitoring node. If there is only one Monitoring node in your deployment, it assumes the standalone role. If you have two Monitoring nodes in your deployment, Cisco ISE displays the name of the other monitoring node for you to configure the Primary-Secondary roles. To configure these roles, choose one of the following:
Primary: For the current node to be the primary Monitoring node.
Secondary: For the current node to be the secondary Monitoring node.
None: If you do not want the Monitoring nodes to assume the primary-secondary roles.
If you configure one of your Monitoring nodes as primary or secondary, the other Monitoring node automatically becomes the secondary or primary node, respectively. Both the primary and secondary Monitoring nodes receive Administration and Policy Service logs. If you change the role for one Monitoring node to None, the role of the other Monitoring node also becomes None, thereby cancelling the high availability pair after you designate a node as a Monitoring node, you will find this node listed as a syslog target in the Remote Logging Targets window: Administration > System > Logging > Remote Logging Targets.
Policy Service Check this check box to enable any one or all of the following services:
Enable Session Services: Check this check box to enable network access, posture, guest, and client provisioning services. Choose the group to which this Policy Service node belongs from the Include Node in Node Group drop-down list. Note that CA and EST services can only run on a Policy Service node that has session services enabled on it.
For Include Node in Node Group, choose None if you do not want this Policy Service node to be part of any group.
All the nodes within the same node group should be configured on the network access device (NAD) as RADIUS clients and authorized for CoA, because any one of them can issue a CoA request for the sessions that are established through any node in the node group. If you are not using a load balancer, the nodes in a node group should be the same as, or a subset of the RADIUS servers and clients configured on the NAD. These nodes would also be configured as RADIUS servers.
While a single NAD can be configured with many ISE nodes as RADIUS servers and dynamic-authorization clients, it is not necessary for all the nodes to be in the same node group.
The members of a node group should be connected to each other using high-speed LAN connection such as Gigabit Ethernet. The node group members need not be L2 adjacent, but L2 adjacency is highly recommended to ensure sufficient bandwidth and reachability. See the Create Policy Service Node Group section in See Create a Policy Service Node Group for more details.
Enable Profiling Service: Check this check box to enable the Profiler service. If you enable the Profiling service, you must click the Profiling Configuration tab and enter the details as required. When you enable or disable any of the services that run on the Policy Service node or make any changes to this node, you will be restarting the application server processes on which these services run. You must expect a delay while these services restart. You can determine when the application server has restarted on a node by using the show application status ise command from the CLI.
Enable SXP Service: Check this check box to enable SXP service on the node. You must also specify the interface to be used for SXP service.
Enable Device Admin Service: Check this check box to create TACACS policy sets, policy results, and so on to control and audit the configuration of network devices.
pxGrid Check this check box to enable pxGrid persona. Cisco pxGrid is used to share the context-sensitive information from Cisco ISE session directory to other policy network systems such as Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA). The pxGrid framework can also be used to exchange policy and configuration data between nodes like sharing tags and policy objects between ISE and third party vendors, and for non-ISE related information exchanges such as threat information.

Certificate-Signing Request Settings
Cisco ISE allows you to generate CSRs for all the nodes in your deployment from the Admin portal in a single request. Also, you can choose to generate the CSR for a single node or multiple both nodes in the deployment. If you choose to generate a CSR for a single node, ISE automatically substitutes the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the particular node in the CN= field of the certificate subject. If you choose to include an entry in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field of the certificate, you must enter the FQDN of the ISE node in addition to other SAN attributes. If you choose to generate CSRs for all the nodes in your deployment, check the Allow Wildcard Certificates check box and enter the wildcard FQDN notation in the SAN field (DNS name), for example, *.amer.example.com. If you plan to use the certificate for EAP Authentication, do not enter the wildcard value in the CN= field.
With the use of wildcard certificates, you no longer have to generate a unique certificate for each Cisco ISE node. Also, you no longer have to populate the SAN field with multiple FQDN values to prevent certificate warnings. Using an asterisk (*) in the SAN field allows you to share a single certificate across multiple both nodes in a deployment and helps prevent certificate name mismatch warnings. However, use of wildcard certificates is considered less secure than assigning a unique server certificate for each Cisco ISE node.

Field Usage Guidelines
Certificate(s) will be used for
Choose the service for which you are going to use the certificate:
Cisco ISE Identity Certificates
Multi-Use: Used for multiple services (Admin, EAP-TLS Authentication, pxGrid, and Portal). Multi-use certificates use both client and server key usages. The certificate template on the signing CA is often called a Computer or Machine certificate template. This template has the following properties:
Key Usage: Digital Signature (Signing)
Extended Key Usage: TLS Web Server Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1) and TLS Web Client Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2)
Admin: Used for server authentication (to secure communication with the Admin portal and between ISE nodes in a deployment). The certificate template on the signing CA is often called a Web Server certificate template. This template has the following properties:
Key Usage: Digital Signature (Signing)
Extended Key Usage: TLS Web Server Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1)
EAP Authentication: Used for server authentication. The certificate template on the signing CA is often called a Computer or Machine certificate template. This template has the following properties:
Key Usage: Digital Signature (Signing)
Extended Key Usage: TLS Web Server Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1)
Note 
Digital signature key usage is required for EAP-TLS client certificates.
Portal: Used for server authentication (to secure communication with all ISE web portals). The certificate template on the signing CA is often called a Computer or Machine certificate template. This template has the following properties:
Key Usage: Digital Signature (Signing)
Extended Key Usage: TLS Web Server Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1)
pxGrid: Used for both client and server authentication (to secure communication between the pxGrid client and server). The certificate template on the signing CA is often called a Computer or Machine certificate template. This template has the following properties:
Key Usage: Digital Signature (Signing)
Extended Key Usage: TLS Web Server Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1) and TLS Web Client Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2)
Note 
We recommend that you do not use a certificate that contains the value of 2.5.29.37.0 for the Any Purpose object identifier in the Extended Key Usage attribute. If you use a certificate that contains the value of 2.5.29.37.0 for the Any Purpose object identifier in the Extended Key Usage attribute, the certificate is considered invalid and the following error message is displayed:
source=local ; type=fatal ; message="unsupported certificate"
Cisco ISE Certificate Authority Certificates
ISE Root CA: (Applicable only for the internal CA service ) Used for regenerating the entire internal CA certificate chain including the root CA on the Primary PAN and subordinate CAs on the PSNs.
ISE Intermediate CA: (Applicable only for the internal CA service when ISE acts as an intermediate CA of an external PKI) Used to generate an intermediate CA certificate on the Primary PAN and subordinate CA certificates on the PSNs. The certificate template on the signing CA is often called a Subordinate Certificate Authority. This template has the following properties:
Basic Constraints: Critical, Is a Certificate Authority
Key Usage: Certificate Signing, Digital Signature
Extended Key Usage: OCSP Signing (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.9)
Renew ISE OCSP Responder Certificates: (Applicable only for the internal CA service) Used to renew the ISE OCSP responder certificate for the entire deployment (and is not a certificate signing request). For security reasons, we recommend that you renew the ISE OCSP responder certificates every six months.
Allow Wildcard Certificates
Check this check box to use a wildcard character (*) in the CN and/or the DNS name in the SAN field of the certificate. If you check this check box, all the nodes in the deployment are selected automatically. You must use the asterisk (*) wildcard character in the left-most label position. If you use wildcard certificates, we recommend that you partition your domain space for greater security. For example, instead of *.example.com, you can partition it as *.amer.example.com. If you do not partition your domain, it can lead to security issues.
Generate CSRs for these Nodes
Check the check boxes next to the nodes for which you want to generate the certificate. To generate a CSR for select nodes in the deployment, you must uncheck the Allow Wildcard Certificates option.
Common Name (CN)
By default, the common name is the FQDN of the ISE node for which you are generating the CSR. $FQDN$ denotes the FQDN of the ISE node. When you generate CSRs for multiple nodes in the deployment, the Common Name field in the CSRs is replaced with the FQDN of the respective ISE nodes.
Organizational Unit (OU)
Organizational Unit name. For example, Engineering.
Organization (O)
Organization name. For example, Cisco.
City (L)
(Do not abbreviate) City name. For example, San Jose.
State (ST)
(Do not abbreviate) State name. For example, California.
Country (C)
Country name. You must enter the two-letter ISO country code. For example, US.
Subject Alternative Name (SAN)
An IP address, DNS name, Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), or Directory Name that is associated with the certificate.
DNS Name: If you choose the DNS name, enter the fully qualified domain name of the ISE node. If you have enabled the Allow Wildcard Certificates option, specify the wildcard notation (an asterisk and a period before the domain name). For example, *.amer.example.com.
IP Address: IP address of the ISE node to be associated with the certificate.
Uniform Resource Identifier: A URI that you want to associate with the certificate.
Directory Name: A string representation of distinguished name(s) (DNs) defined per RFC 2253. Use a comma (,) to separate the DNs. For “dnQualifier” RDN, escape the comma and use backslash-comma “\,” as separator. For example, CN=AAA,dnQualifier=O=Example\,DC=COM,C=IL
Key Length
Choose 2048 or greater if you plan to get a public CA-signed certificate or deploy Cisco ISE as a FIPS-compliant policy management system.
Digest to Sign With
Choose one of the following hashing algorithm: SHA-1 or SHA-256.
Certificate Policies
Enter the certificate policy OID or list of OIDs that the certificate should conform to. Use comma or space to separate the OIDs.

Usage
Trust for authentication within ISE
Check the check box if you want this certificate to verify server certificates (from other ISE nodes or LDAP servers).
Trust for client authentication and Syslog
(Applicable only if you check the Trust for authentication within ISE check box) Check the check box if you want this certificate to be used to:
Authenticate endpoints that connect to ISE using the EAP protocol
Trust a Syslog server
Trust for authentication of Cisco Services
Check this check box if you want this certificate to be used to trust external Cisco services such as the feed service.
Certificate Status Validation
ISE supports two ways of checking the revocation status of a client or server certificate that is issued by a particular CA. The first is to validate the certificate using the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP), which makes a request to an OCSP service maintained by the CA. The second is to validate the certificate against a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) which is downloaded from the CA into ISE. Both of these methods can be enabled, in which case OCSP is used first, and only if a status determination cannot be made then the CRL is used.
Validate Against OCSP Service
Check the check box to validate the certificate against OCSP services. You must first create an OCSP Service to be able to check this box.
Reject the request if OCSP returns UNKNOWN status
Check the check box to reject the request if certificate status is not determined by OCSP. If you check this check box, an unknown status value returned by the OCSP service will cause ISE to reject the client or server certificate currently being evaluated.
Reject the request if OCSP Responder is unreachable
Check the check box for ISE to reject the request if the OCSP Responder is not reachable.
Download CRL
Check the check box for the Cisco ISE to download a CRL.
CRL Distribution URL
Enter the URL to download the CRL from a CA. This field will be automatically populated if it is specified in the certificate authority certificate. The URL must begin with “http”, “https”, or “ldap.”
Retrieve CRL
The CRL can be downloaded automatically or periodically. Configure the time interval between downloads.
If download failed, wait
Configure the time interval to wait before Cisco ISE tries to download the CRL again.
Bypass CRL Verification if CRL is not Received
Check this check box, for the client requests to be accepted before the CRL is received. If you uncheck this check box, all client requests that use certificates signed by the selected CA will be rejected until Cisco ISE receives the CRL file.
Ignore that CRL is not yet valid or expired
Check this check box if you want Cisco ISE to ignore the start date and expiration date and continue to use the not yet active or expired CRL and permit or reject the EAP-TLS authentications based on the contents of the CRL.
Uncheck this check box if you want Cisco ISE to check the CRL file for the start date in the Effective Date field and the expiration date in the Next Update field. If the CRL is not yet active or has expired, all authentications that use certificates signed by this CA are rejected.

It is verified that the number that is received in the response is the same as the number that is included in the request. This option ensures that old communications cannot be reused in replay attacks.
Validate Response Signature
The OCSP responder signs the response with one of the following certificates:
The CA certificate
A certificate different from the CA certificate
In order for Cisco ISE to validate the response signature, the OCSP responder needs to send the response along with the certificate, otherwise the response verification fails, and the status of the certificate cannot be relied on. According to the RFC, OCSP can sign the response using different certificates. This is true as long as OCSP sends the certificate that signed the response for Cisco ISE to validate it. If OCSP signs the response with a different certificate that is not configured in Cisco ISE, the response verification will fail.
Use OCSP URLs specified in Authority Information Access (AIA)
Click the radio button to use the OCSP URLs specified in the Authority Information Access extension.
Response Cache
Cache Entry Time To Live n Minutes
Enter the time in minutes after which the cache entry expires. Each response from the OCSP server holds a nextUpdate value. This value shows when the status of the certificate will be updated next on the server. When the OCSP response is cached, the two values (one from the configuration and another from response) are compared, and the response is cached for the period of time that is the lowest value of these two. If the nextUpdate value is 0, the response is not cached at all. Cisco ISE will cache OCSP responses for the configured time. The cache is not replicated or persistent, so when Cisco ISE restarts, the cache is cleared. The OCSP cache is used in order to maintain the OCSP responses and for the following reasons:
To reduce network traffic and load from the OCSP servers on an already-known certificate
To increase the performance of Cisco ISE by caching already-known certificate statuses
Clear Cache
Click Clear Cache to clear entries of all the certificate authorities that are connected to the OCSP service.
In a deployment, Clear Cache interacts with all the nodes and performs the operation. This mechanism updates every node in the deployment.

RADIUS Settings
The following table describes the fields on the RADIUS Settings page. The navigation path for this page is:Administration > System > Settings > Protocols > RADIUS.
When you enable anomalous client suppression and an endpoint authentication fails twice within the configured detection interval, Cisco ISE marks the supplicant as misconfigured and suppresses additional failed authentications with the same failure reason. You can find more details about the suppression by clicking the Misconfigured Supplicant Counter link on the Live Authentications page. A successful authentication from a suppressed endpoint clears the suppression, and results in a decrease in the Misconfigured Supplicant Counter value on the Live Authentications page. Also, if there is no authentication activity from the suppressed endpoint for a period of six hours, the suppression is cleared automatically.
Cisco ISE allows you to enable strong suppression by enabling the Reject Requests After Detection option. If you check the Reject Requests After Detection check box, and an endpoint authentication fails five times with the same failure reason, Cisco ISE activates strong suppression. All subsequent authentications, whether successful or not, are suppressed, and authentication does not occur. This “strong” suppression is cleared after the configured Request Rejection Interval elapses or after six hours of authentication inactivity from the endpoint.

Note
If you configure suppression of RADIUS failures, you may still receive the error "5440 Endpoint Abandoned EAP Session and started a new one" after you configure Radius log suppression. For more information, see the following ISE Community post:

Support for Session Aware Networking (SAnet)
Cisco ISE provides limited support for Session Aware Networking (SAnet). SAnet is a session management framework that runs on many Cisco switches. SAnet manages access sessions, including visibility, authentication, and authorization. SAnet uses a service template, which contains RADIUS authorization attributes. Cisco ISE includes a service template inside an authorization profile. Cisco ISE identifies service templates in an authorization profile using a flag that identifies the profile as “Service Template” compatible.
Cisco ISE authorization profiles contain RADIUS authorization attributes that are transformed into a list of attributes. SAnet service templates also contain of RADIUS authorization attributes, but those attributes are not transformed into a list.
For SAnet devices, Cisco ISE sends the name of the service template. The device downloads the content of the service template, unless it already has that content in a cache or statically defined configuration. Cisco ISE sends a CoA notification to the device when a service template changes RADIUS attributes.

Portal Name: Enter a unique portal name to access this portal. Do not use this portal name for any other Sponsor, Guest, or nonguest portals, such as Blacklist, Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), Client Provisioning, Mobile Device Management (MDM), or My Devices portals.
This name appears in the authorization profile portal selection for redirection choices. It is applied to the list of portals for easy identification among other portals.
Description—Optional.
Portal test URL—A system-generated URL displays as a link after you click Save. Use it to test the portal.
Click the link to open a new browser tab that displays the URL for this portal. Policy Services Node (PSN) with Policy Services must be turned on. If Policy Services are disabled, the PSN only displays the Admin portal.

Note
The test portal does not support RADIUS sessions, so you won't see the entire portal flow for all portals. BYOD and Client Provisioning are examples of portals that depend on RADIUS sessions. For example, a redirect to an external URL will not work. If you have more than one PSN, ISE chooses the first active PSN.
Language File—Each portal type supports 15 languages by default, which are available as individual properties files bundled together in a single zipped language file. Export or import the zipped language file to use with the portal. The zipped language file contains all the individual language files that you can use to display text for the portal.
The language file contains the mapping to the particular browser locale setting (for example, for French: fr, fr-fr, fr-ca) along with all of the string settings for the entire portal in that language. A single language file contains all the supported languages, so that it can easily be used for translation and localization purposes.
If you change the browser locale setting for one language, the change is applied to all the other end-user web portals. For example, if you change the French.properties browser locale from fr,fr-fr,fr-ca to fr,fr-fr in the Hotspot Guest portal, the changes also apply to the My Devices portal.
An alert icon displays when you customize any of the text on the Portal Page Customizations tab. The alert message reminds you that any changes made to one language while customizing the portal must also be added to all the supported languages properties files. You can manually dismiss the alert icon using the drop-down list option; or it is automatically dismissed after you import the updated zipped language file.

Use these settings to specify values or define behavior that applies to the overall portal; not just to specific portal pages that display to the user (guests, sponsors, or employees as applicable).
HTTPS port—Enter a port value between 8000 to 8999; the default value is 8443 for all the default portals, except the Blacklist Portal, which is 8444. If you upgraded with port values outside this range, they are honored until you modify this page. If you modify this page, update the port setting to comply with this restriction.
If you assign Ports used by a non-guest (such as My Devices) portal to a guest portal, an error message displays.
For posture assessments and remediation only, the Client Provisioning portal also uses Ports 8905 and 8909. Otherwise, it uses the same Ports assigned to the Guest portal.
Portals assigned to the same HTTPS port can use the same Gigabit Ethernet interface or another interface. If they use the same port and interface combination, they must use the same certificate group tag. For example:
Valid combinations include, using the Sponsor portal as an example:
Sponsor portal: Port 8443, Interface 0, Certificate tag A and My Devices portal: Port 8443, Interface 0, Certificate group A.
Sponsor portal: Port 8443, Interface 0, Certificate group A and My Devices portal: Port 8445, Interface 0, Certificate group B.
Sponsor portal: Port 8444, Interface 1, Certificate group A and Blacklist portal: Port 8444, Interface 0, Certificate group B.
Invalid combinations include:
Sponsor portal: Port 8443, Interface 0, Certificate group A and My Devices portal: 8443, Interface 0, Certificate group B.
Sponsor portal: Port 8444, Interface 0, Certificate tag A and Blacklist portal: Port 8444, Interface 0, Certificate group A.

Note
We recommend that you use interface 0 for Guest for best performance. You can either configure only interface 0 in the Portal Settings, or you can use the CLI command ip host to map a hostname or FQDN to the IP address of interface 0.
Allowed interfaces — Select the PSN interfaces which a PAN can use to run a portal. When a request to open a portal is made on the PAN, the PAN looks for an available allowed Port on the PSN. You must configure the Ethernet interfaces using IP addresses on different subnets.
These interfaces must be available on all the PSNs, including VM-based ones, that have Policy Services turned on. This is a requirement because any of these PSNs can be used for the redirect at the start of the guest session.

The interfaces you enable here must be available on all your PSNs, including VM-based ones when Policy Services turned on. This is required because any of these PSNs can be used for a redirect at the start of the guest session.
The portal certificate Subject Name / Alternate Subject Name must resolve to the interface IP.
Configure ip host x.x.x.x yyy.domain.com in ISE CLI to map secondary interface IP to FQDN, which is used to match Certificate Subject Name / Alternate Subject Name.
Certificate group tag—Pick a certificate group tag that specifies the certificate to use for the portal’s HTTPS traffic.
Display Language
Use browser locale—Use the language specified in the client browser's locale setting as the display language of the portal. If browser locale's language is not supported by ISE, then the Fallback Language is used as the language portal.
Fallback language—Choose the language to use when language cannot be obtained from the browser locale, or if the browser locale language is not supported by ISE.
Always use—Choose the display language to use for the portal. This setting overrides the User browser locale option.

BYOD Settings for BYOD Portals
The navigation path for these settings is Administration > Device Portal Management > BYOD Portals > Create, Edit or Duplicate > Portal Behavior and Flow Settings > BYOD Settings.
Use these settings to enable Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) functionality for employees who want to use their personal devices to access your corporate network.
Field Usage Guidelines
Include an AUP (on page/as link)
Display your company’s network-usage terms and conditions, either as text on the page currently being displayed for the user or as a link that opens a new tab or window with AUP text.
Require acceptance
Require users to accept an AUP before their account is fully enabled. The Login button is not enabled unless the user accepts the AUP. If users do not accept the AUP, they will not obtain network access.
Require scrolling to end of AUP
This option displays only if Include an AUP on page is enabled.
Ensure that the user has read the AUP completely. The Accept button activates only after the user has scrolled to the end of the AUP.
Display Device ID field during registration
Display the device ID to the user during the registration process, even though the device ID is pre-configured and cannot be changed while using the BYOD portal.
Originating URL
After successfully authenticating to the network, redirect the user’s browser to the original website that the user is trying to access, if available. If not available, the Authentication Success page displays. Make sure that the redirect URL is allowed to work on port 8443 of the PSN by the access-control list on the NAD and by authorization profiles configured in ISE for that NAD.
For Windows, MAC and Android devices, control is given to the Self-Provisioning Wizard app, which does provisioning. Therefore, these devices are not redirected to the originating URL. However, iOS (dot1X) and unsupported devices (that are allowed network access) are redirected to this URL.
Success page
Display a page indicating that the device registration was successful.
URL
After successfully authenticating to the network, redirect the user's browser to the specified URL, such as your company’s website.

Note
If you redirect a Guest to an external URL after authentication, there may be a delay while the URL address is resolved and the session is redirected.

For example, you can entersponsorportal.yourcompany.com,sponsor, so that when the user enters either of those into a browser, the sponsor portal displays. Separate names with commas, but do not include spaces between entries.
If you change the default FQDN, then also do the following:
Update your DNS so that the FQDN of the new URL resolves to a valid Policy Services Node (PSN) IP address. Optionally, this address could point to a load balancer virtual IP address that serves a pool of PSNs.
To avoid certificate warning messages due to name mismatches, include the FQDN of the customized URL, or a wildcard, in the subject alternative name (SAN) attribute of the local server certificate of the Cisco ISE PSN.
Idle timeout—Enter the time in minutes that you want Cisco ISE to wait before it logs out the user if there is no activity in the portal. The valid range is from 1 to 30 minutes.
Login Page Settings
Maximum failed login attempts before rate limiting: Specify the number of failed login attempts from a single browser session before Cisco ISE starts to throttle that account. This does not cause an account lockout. The throttled rate is configured in Time between login attempts when rate limiting.

Reinstate
For all devices.
This action reinstates a block listed, lost or stolen device and resets it status to its last known value. This action resets the status of a stolen device to Not Registered, since it has to undergo additional provisioning before it can connect to the network.
If you want to prevent employees reinstating devices that you have block listed, do not enable this option in the My Devices portal.
Delete
For all devices.
Enable employees to delete a registered device from the My Devices portal or to delete unused and add new devices, once the maximum number of registered devices is reached. This action removes the device from the list of devices displayed in the My Devices portal, but the device remains in the Cisco ISE database and continues to be listed in the Endpoints list.
To define the maximum number of personal devices that employees can register using either the BYOD or My Devices portals, choose Administration > Device Portal Management > Settings > Employee Registered Devices.
To permanently delete the device from the Cisco ISE database, choose Administration > Identity Management > Identities > Endpoints.
Stolen
For all devices.
Enable employees to indicate that their device is stolen. This action updates the device status in the My Devices portal to Stolen, adds the device to the Blacklist endpoint identity group, and removes its certificate.
Device lock
For MDM enrolled devices only.
Enable employees to immediately lock their device remotely from the My Devices portal, in the event it is lost or stolen. This action prevents unauthorized use of the device.
However, the PIN cannot be set in the My Devices portal and should have already been configured by the employee on their mobile device in advance.
Unenroll
For MDM enrolled devices only.
Enable employees to choose this option if they no longer need to use their device at work. This action removes only those applications and settings installed by your company, while retaining other apps and data on the employee's mobile device.
Full wipe
For MDM enrolled devices only.
Enable employees to choose this option if they have lost their device or are replacing it with a new one. This action resets the employee's mobile device to its default factory settings, removing installed apps and data.
