Problem Description
Chrome will deprecate direct access to private network endpoints, as part of the Private Network Access (PNA) specification, which begins from Chrome version 111. This is also applicable for Chromium-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge.
Background
With Chrome version 111, Chrome will start to send a Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) pre-flight request ahead of any private network request for a sub resource, as specified by the PNA specification which asks for explicit permission from the target server.
This pre-flight request will carry a new header, Access-Control-Request-Private-Network: true, and the response must carry a header that corresponds to it, Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true.
The aim is to protect users from Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks that target routers and other devices on private networks.
Problem Symptom
When a web application tries to access a resource from a server that is in a "more" private network space (as defined in the Chrome Reference URL), the HTTP method to retrieve the resource will error out, and the corresponding page/UI component/widget and/or resource data will not load. The UI (depending on the web application) will likely display an error message which indicates the access failure.
For more details, refer to Chrome's Reference - Private Network Access: introducing preflights.
Note: At the time of publishing this article, these changes from the Chrome browser are planned from version 111, however ongoing changes can occur. Administrators are recommended to refer to the Chrome Rollout Plan for latest updates to this feature.
Workaround/Solution
It is recommended to upgrade to fixed versions as mentioned in this section. In cases where an upgrade is not chosen, but administrative control over Chrome users is available, PNA checks can be disabled through a workaround that uses Chrome Enterprise policies.
Refer to these Chrome developer blogs related to this topic for more information on how this can be achieved.
In order to disable PNA checks, see:
InsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowed
InsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowedForUrls (enterprise policies)

Chrome sends Private Network Access preflights for subresources.
Chrome: Version 111 - Rollout Plan
Edge: Version 111 - Site compatibility-impacting changes coming to Microsoft Edge
Chromium: Version 115 - Private Network Access preflight requests for subresources
