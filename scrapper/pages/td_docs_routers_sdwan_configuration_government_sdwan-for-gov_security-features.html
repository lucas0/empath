Encrypt Communications
IPsec Pairwise Keys
Encrypt Communications
The U.S. federal government requires that all data at rest and in transit be encrypted.
To satisfy this requirement, Cisco uses the following forms of encryption:
Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 encryption.
FIPS Object Module - meets the FIPS 140-2 requirements, performs the FIPS-approved cryptographic functions, and is designed for use in conjunction with Cisco SSL distributions. FIPS mode is enabled by default in Cisco SD-WAN for government.
For more information, see Cisco FIPS Object Module.
Cisco SSL is a Cisco-enhanced version of OpenSSL, which enables products to achieve FIPS compliance.
For more information, see Cryptographic Module Validation Program CMVP.

Note
All the virtual machines within the Cisco SD-WAN for government boundary use the 7.x version of the Cisco SSL library, which runs in FIPS mode, thereby ensuring that all the data at rest and in transit are encrypted.

Description
Secure Communication Using Pairwise IPsec Keys
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Release 16.12.1b
This feature allows you to create and install private pairwise IPsec session keys for secure communication between an IPsec device and its peers.
The IPsec pairwise keys feature implements controller-based key exchange protocol between a device and controller.
Controller-based key exchange protocol is used to create a Gateway-to-Gateway VPN (RFC7018) in either a full-mesh topology or dynamic full-mesh topology.
The network devices set up a protected control-plane connection to the controller. The controller distributes policies to network devices. The network devices, in turn, communicate with each other through a secure data plane.
A pair of IPsec session keys (one encryption key and one decryption key) are configured for each pair of local and remote transport locations (TLOC).
Pairwise Keys
IPsec Security Association Rekey
Configure IPsec Pairwise Keys Using Cisco vManage
Pairwise Keys
Key exchange method combined with authentication policies facilitate pairwise key creation between two network devices. You use a controller to distribute keying material and policies between network devices. The devices generate private pairwise keys with each other.
IPsec devices share public keys from the Diffie-Hellman (DH) algorithm with the controllers. The controllers relay the DH public keys to authorized peers of the IPsec device as defined by the centralized policy.
Network devices create and install private pairwise IPsec session keys to secure communication with their peers.
IPsec Security Association Rekey
Every rekeying IPsec device generates a new Diffie-Hellman (DH) pair and new IPsec security association pairs for each peer with which it is communicating. The new security association pairs are generated as a combination of the new DH private key and the DH public key of each peer. The IPsec device distributes the new DH public value to the controller, which forwards it to its authorized peers. Each peer continues to transmit to the existing security association, and subsequently, to new security associations.
During a simultaneous rekey, up to four pairs of IPsec Security Associations (SAs) can be temporarily created. These four pairs converge on a single rekey of a device.
An IPsec device can initiate a rekey due to reasons such as the local time or a volume-based policy, or the counter result of a cipher counter mode initialization vector nearing completion.
When you configure a rekey on a local inbound security association, it triggers a peer outbound and inbound security association rekey. The local outbound security association rekey is initiated after the IPsec device receives the first packet with the new Security Parameter Index (SPI) from a peer.

Note
A pairwise-key device can form IPsec sessions with both pairwise and nonpairwise devices.
The rekeying process requires higher control plane CPU usage, resulting in lower session scaling.
Configure IPsec Pairwise Keys Using Cisco vManage
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Templates.
Click Feature Templates and then click Add Template.

Note
In Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1 and earlier releases, Feature Templates is called Feature.
From the Device Model drop-down menu, choose the type of device for which you are creating the template.
From Basic Information, click Cisco Security feature template.
From Basic Configuration, click On or Off from the IPsec pairwise-keying field.
Alternatively, enter the pairwise key specific to the device in the Enter Key field.
Click Save.

Verify IPsec Pairwise Keys on a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Device
Configure Pairwise Keys and Enable Rekeying on the CLI
A pair of IPsec session keys is configured for each pair of local and remote transport locations.
The keys use AES-GCM-256 (AES_256_CBC for multicast) cipher to perform encryption. By default, a key is valid for 3600 seconds.
Configure Pairwise Keys
Use the following command to configure pairwise keys:
Device(config)# security ipsec pairwise-keying

Note
You must reboot the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device for the private-key configuration to take effect.
Configure Rekeying for IPsec Pairwise Keys
Use the following command to configure rekeying for pairwise keys:
Device(config)# security ipsec pwk-sym-rekey
Verify IPsec Pairwise Keys on a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Device
Use the following command to verify the outbound connections for pairwise keys:
