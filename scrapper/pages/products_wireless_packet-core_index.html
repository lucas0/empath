Features and benefits
Any cloud – anywhere
Our 5G core and 4G core solutions are 100 percent virtualized and cloud native by design. Distributed Control/User Plane Separation (CUPS) is designed to deploy required functions where they’re needed most – data center, edge, cloud, and more.
Performance (VPP)
Achieve faster, more reliable performance with Vector Packet Processing (VPP) for mobile. This increases performance to over 400 Gbps without third-party add-ons. Cisco improved open source VPP to support packet core, creating open-source VPP for mobile.
Faster time to market – mitigate risk
Intelligent service mesh, common execution environment, release automation framework, and granular tracing can speed time to market for new services and features by up to 90 percent.
Reduced costs
Common execution environment and advanced automation allows you to introduce new code and services without the potential for a negative network impact. This reduces time and resources to test and release.
