Overview
Easy-to-Use Security Reference Architecture
SAFE can help you simplify your security strategy and deployment. This Cisco security reference architecture features easy-to-use visual icons that help you design a secure infrastructure for the edge, branch, data center, campus, cloud, and WAN. The framework encompasses operational domains such as management, security intelligence, compliance, segmentation, threat defense, and secure services.
SAFE solutions have been deployed, tested, and validated at Cisco and provide guidance, best practices, and configuration steps.
Why complicate your security network design? Keep it simple with SAFE.
The SAFE Key
Click to Enlarge
The SAFE Key organizes security by using two core concepts: Places in the Network (PINs) and Secure Domains.
PINs reference examples of locations that are found in networks and the infrastructure needed to create them:
Data center
Branch
Campus
WAN
Internet edge
Cloud
Secure Domains are operational areas used to protect these locations. They are security concepts that traverse an entire network:
Management
Security intelligence
Compliance
Segmentation
Threat defense
Secure services
