Features and Capabilities
The Cisco Nexus 9396TX Switch has 48 10GBase-T ports that can operate at 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, and 10 Gbps speeds and 12 Quad Small Form Pluggable Plus (QSFP+) uplinks. All the ports are line rate, delivering 1.92 Tbps of throughput in a 2-rack-unit (2RU) form factor. The switch can be deployed as an access switch in traditional three-tier designs or as a leaf node in spine-leaf architectures.
