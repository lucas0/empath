Configuring the Umbrella DNS Connector for Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center
This document describes how to set up the Umbrella DNS Connector in the Secure Firewall management center.
Benefits of the Umbrella Connector
Cisco Umbrella DNS Connection in management center helps to redirect DNS queries to Cisco Umbrella. This allows Cisco Umbrella to validate requests, whether to be allowed or blocked based on the domain names and applies DNS based security policy on the request. If you use Cisco Umbrella, you can configure the Cisco Umbrella Connection to redirect DNS queries to Cisco Umbrella.
The Umbrella Connector is part of the system’s DNS inspection. If your existing DNS inspection policy map decides to block or drop a request based on your DNS inspection settings, the request is not forwarded to Cisco Umbrella. Thus, you have two lines of protection: your local DNS inspection policy and your Cisco Umbrella cloud-based policy.
When redirecting DNS lookup requests to Cisco Umbrella, the Umbrella Connector adds an EDNS (Extension mechanisms for DNS) record. An EDNS record includes the device identifier information, organization ID, and client IP address. Your cloud-based policy can use those criteria to control access in addition to the reputation of the FQDN. You can also elect to encrypt the DNS request using DNSCrypt to ensure the privacy of usernames and internal IP addresses.

Troubleshooting Deployment Issues
Legacy Network Device Token Not Configured
Export-Controlled Features Not Enabled
Legacy Network Device Token Not Configured
Error: Umbrella global cannot be configured as legacy network device token is empty.
Possible Cause Umbrella connection details were not added to the Integration tab. Use Configure the Umbrella Connection to configure the details within the Integration tab.
Possible Cause The management center does not have a connection to the internet. Without internet connectivity, management center is unable to connect to the Umbrella cloud.
Possible Cause Umbrella connection details were added, but the information is not correct. Use Configure the Umbrella Connection to input the proper information and test the connection to ensure that Umbrella is connected.
Export-Controlled Features Not Enabled
You can enable (register) or disable (release) optional licenses. You must enable a license to use the features controlled by the license.
If you no longer want to use the features covered by an optional term license, you can disable the license. Disabling the license releases it in your Cisco Smart Software Manager account, so that you can apply it to another device.
You can also enable evaluation versions of these licenses when running in evaluation mode. In evaluation mode, the licenses are not registered with Cisco Smart Software Manager until you register the device. However, you cannot enable the RA VPN or Carrier license in evaluation mode.
Before you begin
Before disabling a license, ensure that you are not using it. Rewrite or delete any policies that require the license.
For units operating in a high availability configuration, you enable or disable licenses on the active unit only. The change is reflected on the standby unit the next time you deploy the configuration, when the standby unit requests (or frees) the necessary licenses. When enabling licenses, you must ensure that your Cisco Smart Software Manager account has sufficient licenses available, or you could have one unit compliant while the other unit is non-compliant.
Procedure
Step 1
Click the name of the device in the menu, then click View Configuration in the Smart License summary.
Step 2
Click the Enable/Disable control for each optional license as desired.
Enable—Registers the license with your Cisco Smart Software Manager account and enables the controlled features. You can now configure and deploy policies controlled by the license.
Disable—Unregisters the license with your Cisco Smart Software Manager account and disables the controlled features. You cannot configure the features in new policies, nor can you deploy policies that use the feature.
Step 3
If you enabled the RA VPN license, select the type of license you have available in your account.
You can use any of the following licenses: Plus, Apex, or VPN Only. You can select Plus and Apex if you have both licenses and you want to use them both.
