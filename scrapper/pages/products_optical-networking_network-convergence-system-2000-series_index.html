Features and benefits
Next-generation amplification
The Network Convergence System 2000 introduces hybrid Raman-EDFA amplifiers known as erbium doped Raman amplifiers (EDRA). EDRAs are compact, easy to deploy, and support an ultra-low noise figure critical for long-distance, high bit-rate transmission. 
Multi-layer network intelligence
The systemâ€™s Wavelength Switched Optical Network (WSON) control plane architecture enhances Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) capabilities with awareness of wavelength properties and optical impairments. 
Simplified platform integration and interoperability
The 2000 Series easily integrates with the Network Convergence System 4000 and 6000 Series at the network element, network management, and control plane levels. The 2000 Series offers full support for ONS 15454 MSTP line cards and more.
