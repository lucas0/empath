Welcome to the world of network simulation
Cisco Modeling Labs is an on-premises network simulation tool that runs on workstations and servers. With Cisco Modeling Labs, you can quickly and easily simulate Cisco and non-Cisco networks, using real Cisco images. This gives you highly reliable models for designing, testing, and troubleshooting. Compared to building out real-world labs, Cisco Modeling Labs returns results faster, more easily, and for a fraction of the cost.
