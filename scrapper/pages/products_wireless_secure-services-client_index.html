Implement Secure Unified-Network Access
The Cisco Secure Services Client (SSC) is a software supplicant that helps you deploy a single authentication framework to access both wired and wireless networks. It provides 802.1X (Layer 2) user and device authentication and manages user and device identity and the network-access protocols required for secure access. The software, a component of the Cisco Unified Wireless Network, simplifies network management and enhances the user experience by:
Fully integrating with the Cisco Unified Wireless Network access points and wireless LAN controllers
Letting you distribute user profiles to the entire organization through a single Extensible Markup Language (XML) file
Featuring a client interface that improves troubleshooting and lets users connect easily to office, home, and public networks
Automating VPN initiation in non-802.1X environments
Enhance Your Network Security
The Cisco Secure Services Client helps improve network security by:
Protecting network endpoint devices, enforcing security policies, and controlling network access
Supporting leading security standards and Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)
Providing an end-to-end authentication service when combined with the Cisco Secure Access Control Server
