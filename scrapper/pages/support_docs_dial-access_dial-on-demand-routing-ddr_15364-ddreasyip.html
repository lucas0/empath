Introduction
This document explains the use of the Cisco IOSÂ® Software Easy IP feature which is useful in cases where an entire site connects to the Internet via an Internet Service Provider (ISP) that assigns only one IP address for the entire remote site. The Easy IP Router dials Network Access Server (NAS) at the service provider and negotiates its own WAN IP address. The router then uses Network Address Translation (NAT) through this negotiated address with port address translation (PAT) to provide outside access for the inside clients. Another optional function of the Easy IP router is to act as a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server to the LAN inside clients. The Cisco small office, home office (SOHO) router is commonly used in this configuration type.

Background Information
Components of Easy IP
Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)/IP Control Protocol (IPCP): This is defined in RFC 1332 . IPCP provides the ability to dynamically configure an IP addresses over PPP. A Cisco IOS Easy IP router uses PPP/IPCP to dynamically negotiate its own registered WAN interface IP address from a central access server or DHCP server.
NAT: Operates on a router that connects two or more networks together. In Easy IP, at least one of these networks (designated as "inside" or "LAN") is addressed with private addresses that must be converted into a registered address before packets can be forwarded to the other registered network (designated as "outside" or "WAN"). Within the context of Easy IP, port address translation (PAT) is used to translate all internal private addresses to a single outside registered IP address.
DHCP to the LAN clients: This is an optional function of the Cisco Easy IP router which can be used to assign IP addresses to the inside LAN clients. Other methods of assigning IP addresses to the clients such as static assignments or the use of a DHCP PC server could also be used.
How Easy IP works Step-by Step
If the Easy IP router is configured as a DHCP server, the LAN inside clients receive a private IP address from it upon power up. If it is not configured as such, the clients must have an IP address assigned to them in some other way.
When a LAN inside client generates "interesting" traffic (as defined by access control lists) for dialup, the Easy IP router dials and requests a single registered IP address from the central site's access server via PPP/IPCP. Once this connection is made, other LAN inside clients are able to use this circuit as explained in step 4.
The Central Site Access Server replies with a dynamic global address from a local IP address pool which is assigned to the WAN interface of the Easy IP router.
The Easy IP router uses PAT to automatically create a translation that associates the registered IP address of the WAN interface with the private IP address of the LAN inside client and a connection to the Central Site Access Server is made.
For a more detailed understanding of Easy IP, refer to White Paper - Cisco IOS Easy IP.

  EasyIP#
We need to check whether the inside private network hosts are able to connect to Central Site Access Server or not and the NAT feature is functioning properly or not. This can be accomplished by using the extended ping utility. On the EasyIP router, ping the ethernet interface of the Central Site Access Server and specify the source of the ping as the LAN (private) address of the EasyIP router. This ensures that the packet is processed by PAT and that clients on the LAN can communicate with the central site network.

The above output shows the success rate is 100 percent which means that the NAT feature is working fine and the SOHO hosts is able to communicate with Central Site Access Server. We can get more detailed information about the NAT translations from the following show commands output.
