Information About Custom Applications
Cisco Network-Based Application Recognition (NBAR) is a Cisco technology that performs the SD-WAN Application Intelligence Engine (SAIE) flow on network traffic to identify network applications according to their traffic characteristics.

Note
In Cisco vManage Release 20.7.x and earlier releases, the SAIE flow is called the deep packet inspection (DPI) flow.
The specific traffic characteristics of a network application are called an application signatures. Cisco packages the signature for an application, together with other information, as a protocol. Cisco packages a large set of protocols, covering numerous commonly occurring network applications, as a Protocol Pack. Cisco updates and distributes Protocol Packs regularly. They provide a database of network application signatures for NBAR to use to identify network application traffic.
The term network applications is defined broadly, and may include all of the following, and more:
Social media websites
Voice over IP (VoIP) applications
Streaming audio and video, such as Cisco Webex
Cloud applications, such as for cloud storage
SaaS applications
Custom network applications specific to an organization
Identifying applications is useful for monitoring network traffic, configuring application-aware traffic policy, and more.
To summarize network application signatures, protocols, and Protocol Packs, and how NBAR uses them:
The traffic of a network application has unique characteristics that can be used to identify the traffic as belonging to that specific application. These characteristics are called application signatures.
Cisco packages the signature for a specific network application as a protocol.
Cisco packages a large set of protocols, covering commonly occurring internet applications, as Protocol Packs.
Cisco NBAR performs the SAIE flow on traffic to gather the information required to identify the sources of the traffic, and uses protocols, such as those provided in Protocol Packs, to match that information to specific network applications. The result is that NBAR identifies the network applications producing traffic in the network.
Cisco Software-Defined Application Visibility and Control (SD-AVC) uses Cisco NBAR application identification to provide information about application usage within a network.
Custom Applications
In addition to the standard protocols provided in a Protocol Pack, you can define protocols, called custom applications, to identify internet traffic, often for uncommon network applications that are of specific interest to their organization. Custom applications augment the protocols provided in a Protocol Pack.
You can use custom applications in the same way as any other protocol when configuring:
Cisco SD-WAN policies
Application Quality of Experience (AppQoE) policies, such as application-aware routing, TCP acceleration, and Quality of Service (QoS)

Note
The following terms are used in the documentation of related technologies, and are equivalent: custom applications, custom protocols, user-defined applications
Custom Applications in Cisco SD-WAN
Cisco Software-Defined AVC (SD-AVC) is a component of Cisco Application Visibility and Control (AVC). It functions as a centralized network service, operating with specific participating devices in a network. One function of Cisco SD-AVC, which is included as a component of Cisco SD-WAN, is to create and manage custom applications. Cisco SD-WAN uses this Cisco SD-AVC functionality, through SD-AVC REST APIs, to enable you to define custom applications within Cisco SD-WAN.
As a Cisco SD-WAN user, you can use Cisco vManage to define custom applications. Cisco SD-AVC then pushes the custom applications to devices in the network. The devices in the network use the custom applications and other application protocols to analyze traffic traversing the devices.
The process of defining a custom protocol includes choosing criteria to identify network traffic as coming from a specific network application. The criteria can include characteristics of hosts originating the traffic, such as server names, IP addresses, and so on.
Priority of Protocols and Custom Applications
It is possible to define custom applications that match some of the same traffic as a protocol included in the Protocol Pack operating with Cisco NBAR. When matching traffic, custom applications have priority over Protocol Pack protocols. Deploying SD-AVC within an existing network does not require any changes to the network topology.
Restrictions for Custom Applications
Restrictions for Custom Applications
Maximum number of custom applications: 1100
Maximum number of L3/L4 rules: 20000
Maximum number of server names: 50000
For server names, maximum instances of wildcard followed by a period (.): 50000
Example: *.cisco.com matches www.cisco.com, developer.cisco.com
For server names, maximum instances of prefix wildcard as part of server name: 256
Example: *ample.com matches www.example.com
Mapping the same domain to two different custom applications is not supported.
Activation of custom applications:
When using Cisco vManage Release 20.5.1 releases earlier than 20.5.1: For devices using releases earlier than Cisco IOS XE 17.5.1, the activation of custom applications is as follows:
A custom application created in Cisco vManage is not activated for visibility functionality (monitoring traffic) or control functionality (traffic policy) until a policy that makes use of the custom application is applied.
When using Cisco vManage Release 20.5.1 or later: For devices using Cisco vManage Release 20.5.1 or later, the activation of custom applications is as follows:
A custom application created in Cisco vManage is activated immediately for application visibility functionality only (monitoring traffic), such as for protocol-discovery counters and Flexible NetFlow (FNF). When activated for visibility functionality only, custom applications do not affect traffic policy.
When the custom application is used by a policy, it becomes activated for control functionality (traffic policy) also.
Configure Custom Applications Using Cisco vManage
Prerequisites
Install Cisco SD-AVC as a component of Cisco SD-WAN. For information on how to enable SD-AVC on Cisco vManage, see Information on how to enable SD-AVC for Cisco SD-WAN devices.
Perform the following steps to configure custom applications:
In Cisco vManage, select Configuration > Policies.
Select Centralized Policy.
Click Custom Options and select Centralized Policy > Lists.
Click Custom Applications, and then click New Custom Application.
To define the application, provide an application name and enter match criteria. The match criteria can include one or more of the attributes provided: server names, IP addresses, and so on. You do not need to enter match criteria for all fields.
The match logic follows these rules:
Between all L3/L4 attributes, there is a logical AND. Traffic must match all conditions.
Between L3/L4 and Server Names, there is a logical OR. Traffic must match either the server name or the L3/L4 attributes.
Field
Description
Application Name
(mandatory)
Enter a name for the custom application.
Maximum length: 32 characters
Server Names
One or more server names, separated by commas.
You can include an asterisk wildcard match character (*) only at the beginning of the server name.
Examples:
*cisco.com, *.cisco.com (match www.cisco.com, developer.cisco.com, â€¦)
L3/L4 Attributes
IP Address
Enter one or more IPv4 addresses, separated by commas.
Example:
10.0.1.1, 10.0.1.2
Note
  The subnet prefix range is 24 to 32.
Ports
Enter one or more ports or port ranges, separated by commas.
Example:
30, 45-47
L4 Protocol
Select one of the following:
TCP, UDP, TCP-UDP
Click Add. The new custom application appears in the table of custom applications.

Note
To check the progress of creating the new custom application, click Tasks (clipboard icon). A panel opens, showing active and completed processes.

Verify Custom Applications
Verify Custom Applications in Cisco vManage
After you define a custom application, it appears in the Custom Application List, which shows all available protocols and custom applications. The Custom Application List is available here:
Configuration > Policies > Centralized Policy > Add Policy > Custom Applications.
Verify Protocols and Custom Applications on a Device
Use the show ip nbar protocol-id command to display all protocols and custom applications that are loaded on the router. It is helpful to filter the results. For example, to display all protocols and custom applications with "custom" in the name, use this:
vm5#show ip nbar protocol-id | include custom
custom_amazon                    3899          PPDK LOCAL
custom_facebook                  3284          PPDK LOCAL
See show ip nbar protocol-id.
