About the Cisco Vulnerability Database
The Cisco vulnerability database (VDB) is a database of known vulnerabilities to which hosts may be susceptible, as well as fingerprints for operating systems, clients, and applications. The system uses the VDB to help determine whether a particular host increases your risk of compromise.
Cisco issues periodic updates to the VDB. The time it takes to update the VDB and its associated mappings on the Firepower Management Center depends on the number of hosts in your network map. As a rule of thumb, divide the number of hosts by 1000 to determine the approximate number of minutes to perform the update.
You can find VDB updates on the VDB Software Downloads page on Cisco.com.
About the Cisco Firepower Application Detector Reference
The Cisco Firepower Application Detector Reference contains the release notes and information about the application detectors supported in the VDB release. For each application listed in the reference, you can find the following information:
