Cloud OnRamp for SaaS, Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Devices
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r
Cloud OnRamp for SaaS is available for Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices, with a configuration workflow that is entirely different from the workflow that applies to Cisco vEdge devices.
This feature is released as a fully functional beta in Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r. The provisioning workflow is subject to change in future releases.
Many organizations rely on software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications for business-critical functions. These cloud-based services include Office365, Salesforce, Box, and many others. As cloud-based services, these SaaS applications must communicate with their own remote servers, which are available through internet connections.
At remote sites, SaaS applications may these pose special challenges:
Performance: If remote sites, such as branch offices, route SaaS traffic through a centralized location, such as a data center, performance degrades, with latency that affects the user experience.
Inability to optimize routing: Network administrators may not have any visibility into the performance of these SaaS applications, or any ability to change the routing of the SaaS traffic to more efficient paths.
Cloud OnRamp for SaaS (formerly called CloudExpress service) addresses these challenges. It enables you to select specific SaaS applications and interfaces, and to let SD-WAN determine the best performing path for each SaaS application, using the specified interfaces. For example, you can enable:
routing through a direct internet access (DIA) connection at a branch site, if available
routing through a gateway location, such as a regional data center
SD-WAN monitors each available path for each SaaS application continually, so if a problem occurs in one path, it can adjust dynamically and move SaaS traffic to a better path.
For more information, see SD-WAN: Cloud OnRamp for SaaS Deployment Guide.

Overview: How to Configure Cloud OnRamp for SaaS
In contrast to using Cloud OnRamp for SaaS with vEdge devices, configuring the feature for Cisco XE SD-WAN devices includes two steps:
determining the best paths (configured by feature template)
using the best paths (configured by policy)
Here is a high level overview of the tasks.
Task
Component
Summary
1
Determine the best paths for SaaS applications
Feature template
Create a feature template to configure Cloud OnRamp for SaaS to probe paths for specific SaaS application servers, determine the best path for each, and create a table based on these paths.
SD-WAN probes periodically and updates the table with the most up-to-date information about the best path.
If the topology includes gateway and branch sites, separate feature templates are required for branch sites and gateway sites.
See Create a Probes Feature Template.
Note
  The probes feature template is not supported for releases later than Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r.
2
Use the best paths for SaaS applications
Policy
Create a policy to direct specific SaaS applications to use the best paths, as determined by the previous step.
Note
  In the policy, specify only SaaS applications that are included in the feature template. If the policy specifies a SaaS application that is not included in the feature template, the traffic for that application uses the default path, as if Cloud OnRamp for SaaS is not enabled.
See “Create a Policy for Cloud OnRamp for SaaS”.
Common Scenarios for Using Cloud OnRamp for SaaS
For an organization using SD-WAN, a branch site typically routes SaaS application traffic by default over SD-WAN overlay links to a data center. From the data center, the SaaS traffic reaches the SaaS server.
For example, in a large organization with a central data center and branch sites, employees might use Office 365 at a branch site. By default, the Office 365 traffic at a branch site would be routed over SD-WAN overlay links to a centralized data center, and from there to the Office 365 cloud server.
Scenario 1: If the branch site has a direct internet access (DIA) connection, you may choose to improve performance by routing the SaaS traffic through that direct route, bypassing the data center.
Scenario 2: If the branch site connects to a gateway site that has DIA links, you may choose to enable SaaS traffic to use the DIA of the gateway site.
Scenario 3: Hybrid method.
Scenario 1: Cloud Access through Direct Internet Access Links
Scenario 2: Cloud Access through a Gateway Site
Scenario 3: Hybrid Approach
Scenario 1: Cloud Access through Direct Internet Access Links
In this scenario, a branch site has one or more direct internet access (DIA) links, as shown in the illustration below.
Using Cloud OnRamp for SaaS, SD-WAN can select the best connection for each SaaS application through the DIA links or through the SD-WAN overlay links. Note that the best connection may differ for different SaaS applications. For example, Office365 traffic may be faster through one link, and Dropbox traffic may be faster through a different link.
Configuration Workflow
Create Probes feature template(s) only for branch sites, and configure a policy to use Cloud OnRamp for SaaS.
Task
Details
Branch sites
1
Create a Probes feature template for branch sites.
In the Probes feature template, set parameters as follows:
SaaS Mode: SaaS Branch
TLOCS : Select either All DIA TLOC or TLOC List and select the TLOC colors in the drop-down menu.
All DIA TLOC: Select this option if DIA is enabled for all TLOCs at a branch.
TLOC List: If DIA is enabled only on a subset of TLOCs at a site, you can select this option and then select colors corresponding to the TLOCs that have DIA enabled.
SaaS applications: Specify applications for Cloud OnRamp for SaaS.
See Create a Probes Feature Template.
2
Use the feature template in a device template for branch sites.
In the Additional Templates section of the device template, in the Probes field, select the feature template created in the previous step.
3
Apply the device template to branch sites.
Policy
4
Create a policy.
In the App Route Policy, under match conditions, select the Cloud SaaS application, and specify the same applications that you specified while creating the feature template. Select the action to be Cloud SLA.
See “Create a Policy for Cloud OnRamp for SaaS”.
5
Activate the policy
Apply the policy to those branch sites to which the feature template created earlier was applied.
Scenario 2: Cloud Access through a Gateway Site
In this scenario, a branch site has one or more direct connections to a gateway site, and the gateway site has links to the internet.
Using Cloud OnRamp for SaaS, SD-WAN can select the best connection for each SaaS application through the gateway site. If the branch site connects to more than one gateway site, SD-WAN ensures that SaaS traffic uses the best path for each SaaS application, even through different gateway sites.
Configuration Workflow
Create Probes feature template(s) for branch sites and for gateway sites, and configure a policy to use Cloud OnRamp for SaaS.
Task
Details
Branch sites
1
Create a Probes feature template for branch sites.
In the Probes feature template, set parameters as follows:
SaaS Mode: SaaS Branch
TLOCS: All DIA TLOC
SaaS applications: Do NOT specify any applications.
Note
  Note this difference in this workflow, compared with scenario 1 (Cloud Access through Direct Internet Access Links). In this workflow, specify applications in the gateway site configuration (see below).
See Create a Probes Feature Template.
2
Use the feature template in a device template for branch sites.
In the Additional Templates section of the device template, in the Probes field, select the feature template created in the previous step.
