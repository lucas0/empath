Open Defects in Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Release 1.3
Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Reporter
This section lists the open defects for the Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Reporter Release 1.3.0-386.
CSCui47244—Incorrect value on the Current and Peak Concurrent Video Viewers live chart
Symptom    The value of the Current Concurrent Video Viewers inaccurately shows zero when it should be a non-zero value.
Workaround   There is no workaround.
CSCuj43581—Viewing time min can be off by a few percent between some reports
Symptom    If clients report data within the first or last few minutes of an event, that data can end up being shown in some reports and not in others. Slight discrepancies may exist between the various reports that would not otherwise be seen. "Viewing time min" can be off by a few percent between some reports (Category, ApPerf, Sessions).
Workaround   Ensure no client data will be reported in first or last ten minutes of the event.
CSCuj86630—RSSI value is sometimes too low in ApPerf report
Symptom    There is an issue with RSSI in the ApPerf report. The RSSI value is too high (and too low in absolute value, it is a number too close to zero) when clients made with the Cisco StadiumVision Mobile SDK Release 1.2 are reporting.
Workaround   Update clients using Cisco StadiumVision Mobile SDK Release 1.3.
CSCui60652—Duplicate lines in sessions.csv report when schedule is changed during event
Symptom    Lines are duplicated in the sessions.csv report.
Workaround   Change the event schedule before or after an event instead of during an event.
CSCul09032—Some displayed times on the Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Reporter UI are wrong after DST ends
Symptom    The displayed times on Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Reporter Release 1.3 UI are an hour late after Daylight Savings Time (DST) ends (November 3) and will remain so until DST begins again. The incorrect times are:
1. The popup when hovering mouse cursor over the date in the "Select an Event" drop down menu.
2. The start and end times on the x-axis of "Concurrent SVM Clients" and "Concurrent Wifi Clients"
3. Date in lower right of the live charts.
Unaffected times:
1. The time of the beginning and end of the event in the subtitle of event charts.
2. The times in report.
3. The times in the schedule.
4. The time when events actually begin and end.
Workaround   There is no workaround.
CSCul81531—Usernames for PI is saved in lower case when configured through TUI
Symptom    While saving the PI configuration using the TUI, the Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Reporter saves the username in all lowercase regardless of the actual case that the username is entered in. Since PI username is case sensitive this will result in the PI user not being able to access the PI API.
Workaround   To workaround this issue, use only PI usernames that are in lowercase. Alternatively, if you have SNETAC account access, edit the /var/svm/etc/piinfo.properties file and change the username to match the exact case of the username in PI.
Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Streamer
This section lists the open defects for the Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Reporter Release 1.3.0-241.
CSCui33314—Sometimes there are two instances of the Streamer running
Symptom    Sometimes two instances of the Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Streamer software can be running.
Workaround   To stop both streamer instances, execute the following command:
sudo /sbin/service streamer stop
CSCuj20869—Corrupted sudoers file after upgrading to Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Streamer Release 1.3
Symptom    When upgrading a Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Streamer installation in the following order the sudoers files can get corrupted:
1.1 --> 1.2 --> 1.3
Workaround   The issue can be resolved by doing the following:
Step 1 Boot into single user mode.
Step 2 Edit the /etc/sudoers file.
Step 3 Reboot the server.
CSCum10599—Owner/App developer field displays empty field after a streamer fresh install
Symptom    When a streamer fresh install is done the field Content Owner/App Developer, in Defaults
page, displays empty.
Workaround   To workaround this issue, use the following procedure:
Step 1 If sessions have already been created, go ahead and delete them all.
Step 2 Navigate to the Defaults Page.
Step 3 Select Content Owner/App Developer from the drop down menu.
Step 4 Click Apply. The page will redirect to the home page.
Step 5 Click Save Configuration button on the home page.
CSCuj98495—After a full ISO image installation the streamer needs to be restarted
Symptom    After a FULL ISO image installation the expectation is the streamer will be running. However that is not the case and the streamer has to be restarted.
Workaround   Restart the Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Streamer Streamer after a FULL ISO image installation.
CSCui58778—Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Streamer should give a proper message when URL is wrong
Symptom    A data channel is created with an invalid URL. The Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Streamer reports an error, but does not reveal the problem.

Workaround   Try to scroll down the channel list and select a video. It is cumbersome but can be done.
CSCuj31847—When playing video, pressing the home button and then restarting the application brings user to channel list instead of playing the previous video stream
Symptom    When the customer application is playing a video and the home button is pressed, the app takes the user back to the channel list rather than continue to play the video.
Workaround   When it goes to the channel simply select the video that was being watched.
CSCul03167—SDK reports upload success when the reporter URL is invalid
Symptom    When an invalid reporter URL is specified in Streamer/UI the client side reports success of uploading the stats. This is an error.
Workaround   Make sure the reporter URL is valid.
CSCui96734—iOS Customer App reports that Cisco StadiumVision Mobile is down even though another session is running
Symptom    When there are multiple sessions running and there are packet losses for one of the sessions the app reports that Cisco StadiumVision Mobile is down even though there are other sessions running.
Workaround   Ignore the message.
CSCul17815—The installing icon remains on the screen for devices running Apple iOS 7
Symptom    When the customer app is installed on a device running Apple iOS 7, the "Installing." icon does not go away and is stuck. The app functions normally.

CSCuj86252—Android Customer App: changing package name causes the video decoder to not play video
Symptom    Android: Changing the package name from com.cisco.sv to e.g. se.cisco.sv in the customer app code causes video to not play. The log file reveals that the video decoder is not able to load C libraries. It seems that the video decoder does not honor a new package name other than com.cisco.sv.
Step 1 Bring up Customer App code in Eclipse.
Step 2 Change com.cisco.sv to se.cisco.sv in AndroidManifest.xml.
Step 3 Replace "import com.cisco.sv.R" with "import se.cisco.sv.R" in the java source file.
Step 4 Build and Run the app on a device.
Step 5 Select a video channel.
Step 6 An empty screen comes up and is spinning.
Step 7 Look at the log file for errors.
Workaround   Always use a package name that starts with the 'com.", excluding the double quotes. For example, if the desired package name is se.foo.svm then use com.se.foo.svm instead.
