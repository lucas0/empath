How does online testing work?
Your online registration process does not change except that you may now select to test at home or an office as a testing option.
You may continue to use the following forms of payment: valid exam vouchers, valid promotional codes, and credit cards.
The online testing software employs live proctors, augmented with artificial intelligence that uses techniques such as facial recognition and eye movement tracking, to help proctors perform their duties and quickly flag potential security violations.
How to Start your exam
To start your exam, you must sign-in to your Pearson VUE profile, view your upcoming appointment at the top of your profile and choose “Begin Exam” 30 mins prior to your exam appointment.
