Lawful Intercept 2.0
Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1
This feature introduces Lawful Intercept Version 2.0. In the Lawful Intercept 2.0 feature, key information is provided to a law enforcement agency (LEA) by the controllers (Cisco vManage and Cisco vSmart) so that they can decrypt the Cisco SD-WAN IPsec traffic captured by the Managed Service Provider (MSP). This helps the LEA decrypt the encrypted network traffic information. For information on Lawful Intercept 1.0, see the chapter Lawful Intercept in the Cisco SD-WAN Policies Configuration Guide.

Information About Lawful Intercept 2.0
Cisco SD-WAN’s Lawful Intercept feature allows an LEA to get a copy of network traffic for analysis or evidence. This is also referred as traffic mirroring. See the chapter Lawful Intercept in the Cisco SD-WAN Policies Configuration Guide.
From Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1, Cisco SD-WAN implements a new architecture for Lawful Intercept , as shown in the following figure.
Figure 1. Lawful Intercept 2.0 Architecture
The following are the characteristics of the new architecture:
Traffic mirroring is outside the scope of Cisco SD-WAN. The LEA works with the corresponding service provider to capture network traffic for mirroring.

Note
In the illustration above, the service provider is an underlay connection and the IPsec tunnel is an overlay connection.
Because the captured network traffic is encrypted, Cisco vManage and Cisco vSmart Controller provide key information to the LEA.
The LEA retrieves the keys from Cisco vManage to decrypt Cisco SD-WAN IPsec traffic. The LEA ensures that they retrieve key information is retrieved during each rekey period. The rekey period is provided by the service provider. For more information about retrieving keys, see Retrieve an Intercept. For information on rekey period, see Configure Data Plane Security Parameters.
A Lawful Intercept administrator is solely responsible for configuring intercepts and creating Lawful Intercept API users who perform Lawful Intercepts. A Cisco vManage administrator can create an account for the Lawful Intercept administrator; the administrator must be a member of the li-admin group. For more information about creating an account for a Lawful Intercept administrator, see Create Lawful Intercept Administrator.
Prerequisites for Cisco SD-WAN Lawful Intercept 2.0
A Cisco vSmart Controller must be set to vManage mode.
For more information about decrypting the IPsec traffic in Cisco SD-WAN, contact Cisco Support or Cisco Sales team.
Benefits of Cisco SD-WAN Lawful Intercept 2.0
It is not necessary to configure edge devices for Lawful Intercepts.

Note
To configure an intercept, an administrator must select the edge devices that have to be included in the intercept. This is necessary becuase the key information that is retrieved from Cisco vManage also includes the keys for the selected devices.
The service provider captures the data traffic for interception. Traffic is not intercepted from the edge devices.
Configure Lawful Intercept 2.0 Workflow

Note
The Lawful Intercept feature can be configured only through Cisco vManage, and not through the CLI.
To configure Lawful Intercept in Cisco vManage, perform the following steps:
Create Lawful Intercept Administrator
Create Lawful Intercept API User
Create an Intercept
Create a Lawful Intercept Administrator
Using the Admin account in Cisco vManage, create an account for the Lawful Intercept administrator.
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Administration > Lawful Intercept.
Click Add User to create a Lawful Intercept administrator user account.
In the Full Name field, enter a full name for the Lawful Intercept administrator.
In the User Name field, enter a user name for the Lawful Intercept administrator. The user name must be prefixed with li-.
In the Password field, enter a password for the Lawful Intercept administrator.
Confirm the password in the Confirm Password field.
From the User Group drop-down list, choose li-admin, and then click Add.
The newly created Lawful Intercept administrator user account is displayed in the Users window.
Create a Lawful Intercept API User
The Lawful Intercept API User account is for those users of LEA who log in and retrieve key information using Cisco vManage's REST API. These are the users who perform a lawful intercept of the Cisco SD-WAN IPsec traffic.
The LEA use https://{vmanage_ip}/dataservice/li/intercept/retrieve/<intercept_id> to retrieve the key information.
To create a Lawful Intercept API user, perform the following steps:
Log in to Cisco vManage as a Lawful Intercept administrator.

Note
When a Lawful Intercept administrator logs in to Cisco vManage, only the Monitor and Administration options are available in the Cisco vManage menu.
From Cisco vManage menu, choose Administration > Lawful Intercept.
Click Add User to create an Lawful Intercept API user account.
In the Full Name field, enter a full name for the Lawful Intercept API user.
In the User Name field, enter a user name for the Lawful Intercept API user. The user name must be prefixed with li-.
In the Password field, enter a password for the Lawful Intercept API user.
Confirm the password in the Confirm Password field.
From the User Group drop-down list, choose li-api, and click Add.
The newly created Lawful Intercept API user account is displayed in the Users window. The LEA can log in to Cisco vManage using the Lawful Intercept API user account to retrieve key information.
Create an Intercept
Minimum supported release: Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1and Cisco SD-WAN Controllers Release 20.9.1
Configure an intercept to collect intercept data. To configure an intercept, do the following:
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Administration > Lawful Intercept.
Click the Intercepts tab, and then click Add Intercepts.
In the Intercept ID field, enter a number. Enter a minimum of two digits and a maximum of 25 digits.
In the Description field, enter a description for the intercept.
By default the Enable toggle button is enabled. However, the intercept remains in an inactive state after it is created.
Click Next.
In a single tenant mode, the Add Edge Devices window displays all the edge devices in the Cisco SD-WAN network.
Click one or more edge device names to add to the intercept and click Next.
Cisco vManage provides the keys for the edge devices selected here.

Note
Specify an intercept warrant for all the edge devices that are added to the intercept.
When an edge device is added for interception, all its peer devices, which are connected in the same network, are also available for Lawful Interception.
The Add LI API users pages displays all the LI-API users created by the Lawful Intercept administrator.
Click one or more user names to add to the intercept. The users selected here can retrieve key information that is required for interception from Cisco vManage. For information on how keys are retrieved for an intercept, see Retrieve an Intercept.
Click Summary
The summary of the intercept is displayed.
Click Submit. The Intercepts page displays the configured intercept.
Click Sync to vSmart to synchronize the configured intercept configuration in Cisco vManage with Cisco vSmart Controller.
A progress page displays the status of the synchronization and activation. After successful synchronization, the Activate State field displays a green check mark.

Note
The Activate State field displays a green check mark status only if Cisco vSmart Controller is set to vManage mode.
If there are any additional Lawful Intercept tasks, a red dot is displayed on the task list icon in the Cisco vManage toolbar. Click the tasks list icon to view a list of all the active and completed Lawful Intercept tasks. You can view up to 500 latest Lawful Intercept tasks.
If an intercept is modified, the Sync to vSmart button is enabled. Click Sync to vSmart to synchronize the intercept configuration in Cisco vManage with Cisco vSmart Controller.

Note
The Sync to vSmart button is enabled only when a new intercept is created, or when an intercept is edited or deleted.
To retrieve key information that is required for interception, click …, and then click Get IRI. The IRI is retrieved from Cisco vSmart Controller and displayed in Cisco vManage.
Retrieve an Intercept
An LEA is responsible to periodically retrieve key information becuase this information is required to decrypt the traffic captured by the MSP.
An LEA can retrieve key information by using Cisco SD-WAN vManage REST APIs.
An LEA logs in to Cisco vManage as a Lawful Intercept API user.
After a Lawful Intercept API user is authenticated, the LEA sends a request using the Cisco vManage REST APIs specifying the intercept ID that it wants to get the key information for.
When a request from the LEA is received by Cisco vManage, Cisco vManage forwards the request to the Cisco vSmart Controller on which intercepts are configured.
Cisco vSmart Controller then retrieves the key information for the specified intercept ID and returns the key information to Cisco vManage in JSON format.
