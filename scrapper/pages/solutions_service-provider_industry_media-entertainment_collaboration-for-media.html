Collaborate to increase speed to market
The media and entertainment industry is developing content at a much quicker pace than usual. The challenge is to review content on site, even if you're shooting in remote locations. The key is to bring content in HD, through the power of the cloud, in real time and in true form. Directors and producers can now collaborate with remote teams all over the world, to review, mark-up and edit content right there on set.
