About Fabric Manager Client
Cisco Fabric Manager is a Java and SNMP-based network fabric and device management tool with a GUI that displays real-time views of your network fabric, including Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches, Cisco MDS 9000 Family and third-party switches, hosts, and storage devices.
In addition to complete configuration and status monitoring capabilities for Cisco MDS 9000 Family switches and Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches, Fabric Manager Client provides Fibre Channel troubleshooting tools. You can use these health and configuration analysis tools on the MDS 9000 Family switch or Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch to perform Fibre Channel ping and traceroute.
Fabric Manager Release 4.1(1b) and later provides multilevel security system by adding a server admin role that allows access to limited features . The configuration capabilities of a server admin is limited to FlexAttach and relevant data.
Note You must use the same release of Fabric Manager Client and Fabric Manager Server.
Fabric Manager Advanced Mode
Advanced mode is enabled by default and provides the full suite of Fabric Manager features, including security, IVR, iSCSI, and FICON. To simplify the user interface, from the list box in the upper right corner of the Fabric Manager Client, select Simple. In simple mode, you can access basic MDS 9000 features such as VSANs, zoning, and configuring interfaces. Advanced mode option is not available for server admin role.
Launching Fabric Manager Client in Cisco SAN-OS Release 3.2(1) and Later
Note As of Cisco SAN-OS 3.x and NX-OS Release 4.x, the Fabric Manager Client login procedure has changed. If you are running a version of Cisco SAN-OS that is earlier than Cisco SAN-OS 3.2(1), follow the login instructions in the "Setting the Seed Switch in Cisco SAN-OS Releases 3.1(1) to 3.2(1)" section on page A-1 or the "Setting the Seed Switch in Releases Prior to Cisco SAN-OS Release 3.1(1)" section on page A-3.
Note Network administrators must initially launch Fabric Manager Client using Fabric Manager Web Server, as described in the following procedure. Once an administrator has installed the Fabric Manager Client icon on your desktop, you can double-click the icon to launch the Fabric Manager Client.
To launch Fabric Manager Client, follow these steps:
Step 1 Open your browser and enter the IP address where you installed Fabric Manager Server, or enter localhost if you installed Fabric Manager Server on your local workstation.
You see the Fabric Manager Web Server Login dialog box shown in Figure 5-1.
Figure 5-1 Fabric Manager Web Client Login Dialog Box
Step 2 Enter your user name and password and click Login.
You see the Fabric Manager Web Client Summary page.
Step 3 Click the Download link in the upper right corner of the page.
You see the Download page for Fabric Manager and Device Manager (see Figure 5-2).
Figure 5-2 Download Page for Fabric Manager and Device Manager
Step 4 Click the link for Fabric Manager.
If you are launching Fabric Manager Client for the first time, you see a message asking whether you want to create shortcuts for Fabric Manager (see Figure 5-3).
Figure 5-3 Fabric Manager Create Shortcut(s) Message
Step 5 Click Yes to create shortcuts for Fabric Manager.
Note This message only appears the first time you launch Fabric Manager Client. If you select No, your selection will be remembered and you will not be prompted to make a selection again. In this case, you will need to launch Fabric Manager Client using the Fabric Manager Web Client.
Step 6 When the software is installed and icons are created on your desktop, double-click the Fabric Manager icon to launch Fabric Manager.
You see the Fabric Manager Login dialog box shown in Figure 5-4.
Figure 5-4 Fabric Manager Login Dialog Box
Step 7 Enter the Fabric Manager Server user name and password.
Step 8 Check the Use SNMP Proxy check box if you want Fabric Manager Client to communicate with Fabric Manager Server through a TCP-based proxy server.
Step 9 Click Login. Once you successfully log in to Fabric Manager Server, you can set the seed switch and open the fabrics that you are entitled to access.
Note When you launch Fabric Manager Client for the first time or when there are no available fabrics, you see the Discover New Fabric dialog box.
You see the Discover New Fabric dialog box shown in Figure 5-5.
Figure 5-5 Discover New Fabric Dialog Box
Note Only network administrators can discover new fabrics.
Step 10 Click the Ethernet (CDP) radio button to discover using Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP).
Step 11 Starting from NX-OS Release 4.2(0), Fabric Manager uses Cisco Discovery Protocol to discover Ethernet switches such as Nexus 5000, Nexus 7000, Catalyst 4000, and Catalyst 6000 switches. You need to use a CDP seed switch for a CDP discovery.
Set the fabric seed switch to the Cisco MDS 9000 Family switch or Cisco Nexus 5000 Series that you want Fabric Manager to use.
Step 12 Choose the Auth-Privacy option according to the privacy protocol you have configured on your switch:
a. If you have not configured the switch with a privacy protocol, then choose Auth-Privacy option MD5 (no privacy).
b. If you have configured the switch with your privacy protocol, choose your Auth-Privacy choice.
Note You may use SNMP v2 credentials for CDP discovery as the most of the Catalyst switches do not use MD5-DES for configuration.
Note If you want a clean fabric discovery, remove the fabric and rediscover it. If you want a clean LAN discovery, unmanage LAN, remove the CDP seed switch and then rediscover it.
Step 13 Enter the user name and password for the switch.
Step 14 (Optionsl) To limit the discovery, specify the VSAN range.
Scoping limits the resources discovered by Fabric Manager client. You can either include a range of VSANs to be discovered or exclude a range of VSANs from being discovered.
a. To limit the discovery to a range of VSANs, click Included VSAN List radio button. Specify the range of VSANs.
b. To exclude a range of VSANs from being discovered, click Excluded VSAN List radio button. Specify the range of VSANs to be excluded.
Step 15 Click Discover.
You see the Control Panel dialog box shown in Figure 5-6 and Figure 5-7.
Figure 5-6
Control Panel Dialog Box: Open Tab
You see the included and excluded VSANs list under the Fabric tab.
Figure 5-7
Control Panel Dialog Box: Fabrics Tab
Note You see a message in the dialog box when the server and client are running on the same workstation and there are unlicensed fabrics in the database. You also see a message when there are unmanaged fabrics (the state of the licenses is unknown).
Note In the open tab, you see all the discovered fabrics displayed in the control panel. You need to click on the Open button to see all the discovered Ethernet switches.
Step 16 Check the check box(es) next to the fabric(s) you want to open in the Select column, or click Discover to add a new fabric.
Note Only network administrators can continuously manage or unmanage fabrics. For more information, see the "Selecting a Fabric to Manage Continuously" section on page 3-7.
Step 17 Click Open to open the selected fabric(s).
Note  · If you have an incomplete view of your fabric, rediscover the fabric with a user that has no
   VSAN restriction.
 · If the fabric includes a Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch, then the Layer 2 node appears under
   the Switches > Interfaces > Ethernet tree, the VFC (FCoE) node appears under the
   Switches > Interfaces tree, and the FCoE node appears under the Switches tree in the
   Physical Attributes pane.
 · For Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches in the fabric, the tooltip for the switch shows the bind
    information of a virtual Fibre Channel interface to its corresponding Ethernet interface, such
    as vfc2(eth1/4).
To launch Fabric Manager Client from within a running instance of Fabric Manager, follow these steps:
Step 1 Choose File > Open or click the Open Switch Fabric icon on the Fabric Manager toolbar.
You see the Control Panel dialog box (see Figure 5-6).
Step 2 Check the check box(es) next to the fabric(s) you want to open in the Select column and click Open.
Note Changes made using Fabric Manager are applied to the running configuration of the switches that you are managing. If you have made changes to the configuration or performed an operation (such as activating zones), Fabric Manager prompts you to save your changes before you exit.
Launching Fabric Manager Client Using Launch Pad
Starting from Cisco NX-OS Release 4.2(0), you can use Fabric Manager launch pad to connect to any server by specifying the IP address of the server. With launch pad, you can connect to any Fabric Manager Server version 3.3(0) and later. Launch pad establishes connection with the server using HTTP protocol.
To launch Fabric Manager Client using launch pad, follow these steps:
Step 1 Open your browser and enter the IP address where you installed Fabric Manager Server, or enter localhost if you installed Fabric Manager Server on your local workstation.

Fabric Manager Client Quick Tour: Server Admin Perspective
Fabric Manager Release 4.1(1b) and later provides a multilevel security system by adding a server admin role that allows access only to limited features. The configuration capabilities of a server admin role is limited to FlexAttach and relevant data. The server admin can pre-configure SAN for new servers, move a server to another port on the same NPV device or another NPV device and replace a failed server onto the same port without involving the SAN administrator. The server role admin will not be able to manage Fabric Manager users or connected clients.
Fabric Manager Release 4.2(0) and later provides a much improved user interface by including movable and dockable panes to let users arrange the Physical Attributes pane, Logical Domains pane, Fabric pane and Information pane according to requirements, making it easier to manage the workflow. The dockable panes are also called as dockable frames. A dockable frame can be standalone (floating), minimized or maximized. The logical, physical, information and the fabric panes can be can be collapsed and expanded as needed. These panes can also be docked at either the right side left side or to the bottom of the workspace.

Any device, cloud, or loop with a box around it means that there are hidden links attached.

If a switch or director is grayed out, Fabric Manager can no longer communicate with it.
The bottom of the Fabric pane has the following tabs:
•Fabric—When displaying multiple fabrics, each fabric has its own tab. You can switch between fabrics by clicking on their respective tabs.
•Log—Displays messages that describe Fabric Manager operations, such as fabric discovery.
•Events—Displays information about the SNMP traps received by the management station. This includes combination events as detected by discovery and important traps such as license, SNMP, and FICON.
When viewing large fabrics in the Fabric pane, it is helpful to do the following tasks:
•Turn off end device labels.
•Collapse loops.
•Collapse expanded multiple links (collapsed multiple links are shown as very thick single lines).
•Dim or hide portions of your fabric by VSAN.
Note When a VSAN, zone, or zone member is selected in the VSAN tree, the map highlighting changes to identify the selected objects. To remove this highlighting, click the Clear Highlight button on the Fabric pane toolbar or choose Clear Highlight from the pop-up menu.
Context Menus
When you right-click an icon in the Fabric pane, you see a pop-up menu with options that vary depending on the type of icon selected. The various options available for different objects include the following:
•Open an instance of Device Manager for the selected switch.
•Open a CLI session for the selected switch.
•Copy the display name of the selected object.
•Execute a ping or traceroute command for the device.
•Show or hide end devices.
•View attributes.
•Quiesce and disable members for PortChannels.
•Set the trunking mode for an ISL.
•Create or add to a PortChannel for selected ISLs.
The Fabric pane has its own toolbar with options for saving, printing, and changing the appearance of the map. When you right-click the map, a pop-up menu appears that provides options (duplicated on the toolbar) for changing the appearance of the map.
Note You can launch web-based or non-web-based applications from the Fabric pane. To do this, you assign an IP address to the storage port or enclosure. Then right-click to bring up the pop-up menu, and select Device Manager.
Saving the Map
You can save the map in the Fabric Pane as an image, or as an editable Visio diagram. You can save the map with or without labels on the links. The created Visio diagram is editable and saved in two layers:
•The default layer includes all switches and links in the fabric.
•The end devices layer includes the end devices and can be turned off to remove end devices from the Visio diagram.
To save the map as a Visio diagram, select Files > Export > Visio and choose Map or Map with link labels. The saved Visio diagram retains the viewing options that you selected from the Fabric pane. For example, if you collapse multiple links in the map and export the links as a Visio diagram, the Visio diagram shows those multiple links as one solid link.
The Show Tech Support option from the Tools menu also supports saving the map as a Visio diagram.
Purging Down Elements
The Fabric pane allows you to refresh the map at any time by clicking the Refresh Map icon. The Refresh Map icon redraws the map but does not purge elements that are down. To purge down elements you can:
•Click Server > Purge Down Elements. This purges all down elements in the fabric.
•Right-click the Fabric pane and select Purge Down Elements.
•Right-click a down element and select Purge. This action purges only this element from the fabric.
Note If you select an element that is not down and purge it, that element will reappear on the next fabric discovery cycle.
Multiple Fabric Display
Fabric Manager can display multiple fabrics in the same pane as shown in Figure 5-13.
Figure 5-13 Fabric Manager's Multiple Fabric Display Window

The information for both fabrics is displayed; you do not need to select a seed switch. To see details of a fabric, select the tab for that fabric at the bottom of the Fabric pane, or double-click the Cloud icon for the fabric in the SAN tab.
Note Enclosure names should be unique. If the same enclosure name is used for each port, Fabric Manager shows a host/target enclosure connected to both fabrics. To fix this problem, you can either disable auto-creation or create unique enclosure names.
Filtering by Groups
You can filter the Fabric pane display by creating groups of switches or end ports. To create a group in Fabric Manager, follow these steps:
Step 1 Right-click a switch or end port in the Fabric pane map and select Group > Create.
You see the Edit User Defined Group dialog box as shown in Figure 5-14.
Figure 5-14 Edit User Defined Group Dialog Box
Step 2 Enter a group name in the Name field.
Step 3 Use the arrows to move additional switches or end ports from the Available column to the Selected column.
Step 4 Click OK to save the group.
To add a switch or end port to an existing group in Fabric Manager, follow these steps:
Step 1 Right-click a switch or end device and select Group > Add To > YourGroupName.
You see the Edit User Defined Group dialog box as shown in see Figure 5-14.
Step 2 Use the arrows to move additional switches or end ports from the Available column to the Selected column.
Step 3 Click OK to save the updated group.
To filter the display by a group you have created, follow these steps:
Step 1 Expand the Groups folder in the Logical Domains pane.
You see the list of groups that you have created as shown in Figure 5-15.
Figure 5-15 Group Highlighted in Fabric Pane Map
Step 2 Click the name of the group that you want to filter.
In the Fabric pane, the switches or end devices in your group are shown normally; all other switches and end devices are shown in gray.
Step 3 Click the Groups folder in the Logical Domains pane to return the display to normal.
Note User-defined groups tables are filtered based on switches in the group except for switches where CFS-controlled features are enabled when all CFS member switches are displayed to avoid misconfigurations.
Status Bar
The status bar at the bottom of the Fabric Manager window shows the last entry displayed by the discovery process, and the possible error message on the right side. The status bar displays a message stating that something has changed in the fabric and a new discovery is needed. The status bar shows both short-term, transient messages (such as the number of rows displayed in the table) and long-term discovery issues.
Setting Fabric Manager Preferences
To set your preferences for the behavior of the Fabric Manager, choose File > Preferences from the Fabric Manager menu bar. You see the Preferences dialog box with the following tabs for setting different components of the application:
•General
•SNMP
•Map
The default General preferences for Fabric Manager are as follows:
•Show Device Name by—Displays the switches in the Fabric pane by IP address, DNS name, or logical name. The default setting for this value is Logical Name.
•Show WorldWideName (WWN) Vendor—Displays the world wide name vendor name in any table or listing displayed by Fabric Manager. Check the Prepend Name check box to display the name in front of the IP address of the switch. Check the Replacing Vendor Bytes check box to display the name instead of the IP address. The default is the Prepend Name option.
•Show End Device Using—Displays end devices in the Fabric pane using alias or pWWN alias. The default setting for this value is Alias.
•Show Shortened iSCSI Names—Displays the default setting for this value is OFF.
•Show Timestamps as Date/Time—Displays timestamps in the date/time format. If this preference is not checked, timestamps are displayed as elapsed time. The default setting is enabled (checked).
•Telnet Path—Displays the path for the telnet.exe file on your system. The default is telnet.exe, but you need to browse for the correct location.
Note If you browse for a path or enter a path and you have a space in the pathname (for example, c:\program files\telnet.exe), then the path will not work. To get the path to work, you must manually place quotes around it (for example, "c:\program files\telnet.exe").
•Use Secure Shell instead of Telnet—Specifies whether to use SSH or Telnet when using the CLI to communicate with the switch. If enabled, you must specify the path to your SSH application. The default setting is disabled.
•Confirm Deletion—Displays a confirmation pop-up window when you delete part of your configuration using Fabric Manager. The default setting is enabled (checked).
•Export Tables with Format—Specifies the type of file that is created when you export a table using Device Manager. The options are tab-delimited or XML. The default setting is Tab-Delimited.
•Show CFS Warnings—Shows warning messages if CFS is not enabled on all switches for a selected feature.
The default SNMP preferences for Fabric Manager are as follows:

(This feature is useful for large fabrics that cannot be displayed entirely within the Fabric pane.) Bring up the overview window by clicking the Show/Hide Overview Window button. It overlays the fabric window and remains there until you click the Show/Hide Overview Window button again. If you enable this preference, you can detach the overview window and move it to one side while you access the Fabric pane. The default setting for this value is disabled (unchecked).
Network Fabric Discovery
Cisco Fabric Manager collects information about the fabric topology through SNMP queries to the switches that are connected to Fabric Manager. The switch replies after having discovered all devices connected to the fabric by using the information from its FSPF technology database and the Name Server database and collected using the Fabric Configuration Server's request/response mechanisms that are defined by the FC-GS-3/4 standard. When you start Fabric Manager, you enter the IP address (or host name) of a seed switch for discovery.
After you start Fabric Manager and the discovery completes, Fabric Manager presents you with a view of your network fabric, including all discovered switches, hosts, and storage devices.
Network LAN Discovery
Starting from NX-OS Release 4.2(0), you can discover Nexus and Catalyst Ethernet switches using Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP). DataCenter 3(DC3) switches are displayed under Datacenter and LAN nodes. Fabric Manager displays basic information about DC3 switches and its ISLs.
Viewing Ethernet Switches
To view information about Ethernet switches, follow these steps:
Step 1 Click the LAN node under Datacenter node.
Step 2 Click Switches tab in the Information pane.
You can see the switch information as shown in Figure 5-16.
Figure 5-16 Ethernet Switch Information
Note Datacenter is the parent node of SAN and LAN nodes. The SAN node remains in the tree as the parent for all the fabrics.
Removing a LAN
To remove a discovered LAN from the server, follow these steps:
Step 1 Choose Server > Admin.
You can see the switch information as shown in Figure 5-17.
Figure 5-17
Control Panel
Step 2 Click to select the switch IP of the LAN you want to remove.
Step 3 Click Remove.
Modifying the Device Grouping
Because not all devices are capable of responding to FC-GS-3 requests, different ports of a single server or storage subsystem may be displayed as individual end devices on the Fabric Manager map.
To group end devices in a single enclosure to have them represented by a single icon on the map, Fabric Manager, follow these steps:
Step 1 Expand End Devices and then select Storage or Hosts in the Physical Attributes pane.
You see the end devices displayed in the Information pane.
Step 2 Click one of the devices in the Fabric pane, or click the Enclosures tab of the Information pane, and then click the device name (in the Name field) that you want to include in the enclosure.
Step 3 Enter a name to identify the new enclosure in the Fabric pane map.
Step 4 Click once on the device name in the Name field. To select more than one name, press the Shift key and click each of the other names.
Step 5 Press Ctrl-C to copy the selected name(s).
Step 6 Press Ctrl-V to paste the device name into the Name field.
Note To remove devices from an enclosure, triple click the device name and press Delete. To remove an enclosure, repeat this step for each device in the enclosure.
Using Alias Names as Enclosures
To create an enclosure that uses the alias name as the name of the enclosure using Fabric Manager, follow these steps:
Step 1 Expand End Devices and select Hosts or Storage from the Physical Attributes pane.
You see the list of devices in the Information pane. The NxPorts tab is the default.
Step 2 Right-click the enclosure names that you want to convert to alias names and select Alias > Enclosure as shown in Figure 5-18.
Figure 5-18 Alias Enclosure
The Ailas > Enclosures window appears as shown in Figure 5-19. It contains a list of expressions. You can also add expressions to the list and modify expressions in the current list.
Figure 5-19
List of Expressions
Step 3 Click the Apply Changes icon to save the changes and then click Close.
Note Fabric Manager uses the regular expressions to convert multiple alias names into one enclosure. The alias names should be in the same expression pattern rule. You can create enclosure names from selected aliases using the regular expresssions list.
Using Alias Names as Descriptions
To create descriptions that uses alias names as the name of the description using Fabric Manager, follow these steps:
Step 1 Select End Devices and from the Physical Attributes pane.
Step 2 Click the General tab.
You see the list of devices in the Information pane.
Step 3 Select the device names that you want to populate the description with alias names and then click Alias > Enclosure button as shown in Figure 5-20.
You see the alias names are copied to corresponding rows in the description column.
Figure 5-20 Data Population: Alias to Description
Note Fabric Manager does not parse or format the alias name while copying.
Controlling Administrator Access with Users and Roles
Cisco MDS 9000 Family switches support role-based management access whether using the CLI or Cisco Fabric Manager. This lets you assign specific management privileges to particular roles and then assign one or more users to each role.
The default-role contains the access permissions needed by a user to access the GUI (Fabric Manager and Device Manager). These access permissions are automatically granted to all users in order for them to use the GUI.
Cisco Fabric Manager uses SNMPv3 to establish role-based management access. After completing the setup routine, a single role, user name, and password are established. The role assigned to this user allows the highest level of privileges, which includes creating users and roles. Use the Cisco Fabric Manager to create roles and users and to assign passwords as required for secure management access in your network.
Using Fabric Manager Wizards
Fabric Manager Client provides the following wizards to facilitate common configuration tasks:
•VSAN—Creates VSANs on multiple switches in the fabric and sets VSAN attributes including interop mode, load balancing, and FICON.
•Zone Edit Tool—Creates zone sets, zones, and aliases. Adds members to zones and edits the zone database.
•IVR Zone—Creates IVR zone sets, zones, and aliases. Enables IVR NAT and auto-topology. Adds members to IVR zones, and edits the IVR zone database.
•FCoE—Creates virtual Fibre Channel (FC) interfaces and VLAN to VSAN mappings, and binds virtual FC interfaces to Ethernet interfaces or PortChannels.
•PortChannel—Creates PortChannels from selected ISLs either manually or automatically. Sets PortChannel attributes such as channel ID and trunking mode.
•FCIP—Creates FCIP links between Gigabit Ethernet ports. Enables Fibre Channel write acceleration and IP compression.
•DPVM—Establishes dynamic port VSAN membership, enables autolearning, and activates the DPVM database.
•Port Security—Prevents unauthorized access to Cisco MDS switches and reports these intrusions to the administrator.
•iSCSI—Creates zones for iSCSI initiators and adds a VSAN to a target-allowed VSAN list.
•NPV—Reduces the number of Fibre Channel domain IDs in SANs.
•QoS—Sets QoS attributes for zones in the selected VSAN.
•IP ACL—Creates ordered IP access control lists and distributes to selected switches in the fabric.
•License Install—Facilitates download and installation of licenses in selected switches in the fabric.
•Software Install—Verifies image compatibility and installs software images on selected switches in the fabric.
Fabric Manager Troubleshooting Tools
Fabric Manager has several troubleshooting tools available from the toolbar or Tools menu
•Zone Merge Analysis—The zone merge analysis tool (available from the Zone menu) enables you to determine if zones will merge successfully when two Cisco MDS switches are interconnected. If the interconnected switch ports allow VSANs with identical names or contain zones with identical names, then Fabric Manager verifies that the zones contain identical members. The merge analysis tool can be run before attempting a merge or after fabrics are interconnected to determine zone merge failure causes.
•End-to-End Connectivity—Fabric Manager's end-to-end connectivity analysis tool uses FC Ping to verify interconnections between Cisco MDS switches and end-device (HBAs and storage devices) in a particular VSAN. In addition to basic connectivity, Fabric Manager can optionally verify the following:
–Paths are redundant.
–Zones contain at least two members.
End devices are connected to a manageable switch (have a currently active in-band or out-of-band management path.)
•Switch Health Analysis—You can run an in-depth switch health analysis with Fabric Manager. It verifies the status of all critical Cisco MDS switches, modules, ports, and Fibre Channel services. Over 40 conditions are checked. This tool provides a very fast, simple, and thorough way to assess Cisco MDS switch health.
•Fabric Configuration Analysis—Fabric Manager includes a fabric configuration analysis tool. It compares the configurations of all Cisco MDS switches in a fabric to a reference switch or a policy file. You can define what functions to check and what type of checks to perform. The analysis can look for mismatched values, and missing or extra values. If all configuration checking is performed for all functions, over 200 checks are performed for each Cisco MDS switch.
After the analysis is run, the results are displayed with details about the issues that were discovered. You can automatically resolve configuration differences by selecting them and clicking the Resolve button. Fabric Manager automatically changes the configuration to match the reference switch or policy file.
Integrating Fabric Manager and Data Center Network Management Software
Fabric Manager and Data Center Network Management (DCNM) software are the two major components in the Cisco next-generation data center environment. Fabric Manager configures Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches and Cisco MDS 9000 Series switches. DCNM software configures Cisco Nexus 5000 and Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switches. The Scope of the Fabric Manager software is confined to SAN while the scope of the DCNM software is limited to the LAN network.
In a typical data center environment, the mixture of SAN and LAN topology are becoming increasingly common. Since the two management software are not designed to work across their topology limits, users are not able to navigate to Fabric Manager from DCNM software and vice versa.
Integrating Fabric Manager and DCNM provides a single platform to manage the networks in data center 3.0 and it provides seamless user experience under specific configuration. Starting from Cisco MDS NX-OS Release 4.2, the directory structure has changed to accommodate the integration of Fabric Manager with Cisco Nexus 5000 Series products.
Launching a Switch from the Topology Map
To launch a switch in DCNM from Fabric Manager, follow these steps:
Step 1 In the Fabric Manager fabric pane, right-click the Nexus switch in the LAN map that you want to open with DCNM.
You see the pop-up menu as shown in Figure 5-21.
Figure 5-21
