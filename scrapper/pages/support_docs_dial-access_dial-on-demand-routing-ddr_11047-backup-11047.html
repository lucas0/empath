Introduction
This document provides a sample configuration for ISDN backup, and provides basic troublehooting information for this type of configuration.
For information on the most common implementations of ISDN backup, and comparisons between these, refer to the following document: Evaluating Backup Interfaces, Floating Static Routes, and Dialer Watch for DDR Backup.
Prerequisites
Requirements
There are no specific prerequisites for this document.
Components Used
The information in this document is based on the software and hardware versions below.
Two Cisco 2500 routers (Frame Relay data terminal equipment [DTEs] ) running Cisco IOSÂ® Software Releases 12.2(3) and 12.2(5).
One Cisco 4500 router acting as a Frame Relay switch.
The information presented in this document was created from devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If you are working in a live network, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command before using it.
Conventions
For more information on document conventions, see the Cisco Technical Tips Conventions.
Configure
In this section, you are presented with the information to configure the features described in this document.
Note: To find additional information on the commands used in this document, use the Command Lookup Tool (registered customers only) .

Verify
This section provides information you can use to confirm your configuration is working properly.
Use the following commands to verify your configuration:
Certain show commands are supported by the Output Interpreter tool, which allows you to view an analysis of show command output.
show interfaces serial- Displays information about the multicast data-link connection identifier (DLCI), the DLCIs used on the interface, and the DLCI used for the Local Management Interface (LMI).
show interface dialer- Displays information about the dialer interface.
show ip route- Displays IP routing table entries.

Troubleshoot
This section provides information you can use to troubleshoot your configuration.
The Frame Relay configurations with point-to-point subinterfaces and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) as a routing protocol used here are specific to this setup. However, the troubleshooting steps shown are more general and can be used with different configurations such as Frame Relay point-to-multipoint or a primary link with High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) or Point to Point Protocol (PPP) encapsulation, regardless of the routing protocol used.
To verify the backup functionality, one of the interfaces on the Cisco 4500 router that is acting as a Frame Relay switch has been placed in shutdown state in order to simulate problem within the Frame Relay network. Consequently, this leads to the PVC inactive state being conducted to the DTE router via the Frame Relay network, and a Frame Relay subinterface down event. This activates the backup interface.
Troubleshooting Commands
Note: Before issuing debug commands, please see Important Information on Debug Commands.
debug isdn q931
debug backup- Debugs backup events.
debug dialer- Displays debugging information about the packets or events on a dialer interface.
debug ppp negotiation - Causes the debug ppp command to display PPP packets transmitted during PPP startup, where PPP options are negotiated.
debug ppp authentication - Causes the debug ppp command to display authentication protocol messages, including Challenge Authentication Protocol (CHAP) packet exchanges and Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) exchanges.
debug ip ospf events - Displays information on OSPF-related events, such as adjacencies, flooding information, designated router selection, and shortest path first (SPF) calculation
debug frame-relay events - Displays debugging information about Frame Relay ARP replies on networks that support a multicast channel and use dynamic addressing.
