Document history
    Optical transport networks are evolving, and a new generation of open line systems are needed to address overall network trends. As coherent technology drives spectral efficiency closer to Shannon Capacity limits, L-Band spectrum usage is key to improving fiber capacity. Operators expect to move from C-Band to C + L-Band solutions without any service impact. 400G digital coherent optics are disrupting network architecture with long-haul reach in the footprint of a QSFP-DD pluggable. Optical networks will need to account for both digital coherent optics and high-performance transponders moving forward. Enhanced visibility of the fiber network along with operational simplification through end-to-end automation of the lifecycle of the network are also top of mind for operators. The Network Convergence System 1010 is Cisco’s next-generation open line system platform that aims to deliver on these goals and much more.
Product overview – NCS 1010
Cisco NCS 1010 is a 3 RU 300-mm-deep pizza box–style platform that offers one integrated line card slot. NCS 1010 runs carrier-class IOS XR software that enables complete automation of the network life cycle.
NCS 1010 provides the following key benefits:
●     Support for any coherent source – DCOs and performance transponders – NCS 1010 provides an ingress EDFA to support openZR+ digital coherent optics that operate at -10dBm. With a coupler based add-drop structure, high-performance transponders at 72, 95, 140, and beyond GBaud/s rates with any power spectral density can be supported.
●     Scale – NCS 1010 offers hitless migration from C-Band only to C+L-Band designs. Embedded channelized ASE loading provides consistency in performance from day-1 to full capacity growth. A 33-port twin-WSS architecture allows the ROADM terminals to scale express capacity or add-drop capacity.
●     Simplicity - Integrated modules in the NCS 1010 shelf minimize fiber patching and field errors. NCS 1010 is designed to operate as one ROADM degree on a shelf. The inherent degree separation provides higher availability. Embedded software on the NCS 1010 turns up ROADM to ROADM line segments automatically to a state where ASE loading runs across the full spectrum. Built-in dynamic gain equalization in in-line amplifier provides better equalization and performance in C + L-Band designs along with better control of Raman Gain ripple.
●     Complete lifecycle automation – IOS XR operating system software on NCS 1010 provides a rich suite of automation features that include zero-touch provisioning, open config YANG model support with NETCONF and gNMI, streaming telemetry, and gNOI support. Automated end-to-end turn-up of a NCS 1010 network is made possible with embedded control loops on the device. Automated connection verification checks for abnormal patch loss and validates fiber connectivity at ROADM locations. Operators are provided with enhanced visibility of their fiber network through a combination of probes based on OTDR, OSC, OCM, and coherent technology. Machine learning and neural network processing of this data allows for improving event detection.
Solution overview
Cisco’s C+L-Band Open Line System solution consists of the NCS 1010 shelf with an integrated line card for a ROADM degree or an in-line amplifier coupled with fixed filters or passive breakout panels for colorless add-drop or express interconnects.
The 3RU NCS 1010 shelf hosts active components such as ROADMs and amplifiers. The ROADM line card breaks out MPO interfaces into LC connectors using breakouts in rack-mounted panels for colorless add-drop or express interconnects. The operator can choose to combine colorless add-drop with fixed 75-, 100-, or 150-GHz add-drop using 1RU Athermal Arrayed Wave Guide filters.
NCS 1010 line cards come in the following flavors:
●     Optical Line Terminal C-Band
●     Optical Line Terminal C-Band with Raman amplifier
●     Optical Line Terminal L-Band
●     In-line Amplifier C-Band
●     In-line Amplifier C-Band with 1x Raman amplifier
●     In-line Amplifier C-Band with 2x Raman amplifiers
●     In-line Amplifier L-Band

NCS 1010 management and automation
The Cisco NCS 1010 provides comprehensive management capabilities to support Operations, Administration, Maintenance, and Provisioning (OAM&P) through IOS XR CLI, SNMP, syslog, and XML. In addition, iPXE for automated software download and zero-touch provisioning (ZTP) for automated configuration download are available for simplified installation. For machine-to-machine configuration and management of NCS 1004, NETCONF, RESTCONF, and gRPC transport protocols with JSON, XML, and GPB encoding are provided. OpenConfig protocols for management GNMI and operations GNOI are also supported. The NCS 1010 provides a set of native YANG models as well as the ability to map into any industry standard or customer-defined YANG data models. For monitoring, NCS 1004 provides a streaming telemetry feature that relies on a push mechanism to disseminate user-selected PM and status information at user-specified frequencies at granular 10-second intervals. This improves monitoring speed and scale compared to traditional pull-based mechanisms such as SNMP. The telemetry infrastructure also allows for events such as alarms and port state changes to be notified.
NCS 1010 takes a hybrid approach where critical/basic control loops run in the embedded OS software (IOS XR) on each network element and enhanced control loops run on a centralized server in the form of Cisco Optical Network Controller (CONC). The control loops that run on the NCS 1010 include channel and optical XC management, node adjacency discovery with OSPF, OTDR traces and event reporting, span loss verification, Dynamic ASE loading, Raman Tuning, E2E Link performance tuner and simulator, automatic power control, and connection discovery. Enhanced control functions provided on the centralized controller include connection verification, network topology discovery and reporting, optical path computation, and machine learning OTDR events with localization over GIS maps. CONC offers a TAPI-based north-bound API for integration into the operator’s in-house tools.
Figure 7.               
Two-node network topology visualization in CONC
Evolved Programmable Network Manager offers an element management solution for NCS 1010 performance and fault monitoring along with inventory, software, and database management.
Operators can use Cisco Optical Network Planner (CONP) to model NCS 1010 networks and generate rack layouts, bill of materials, fiber connectivity layouts, YANG configuration file, and optical performance results. Alien OCHNC circuits can be simulated for any Cisco or non-Cisco transponder over a NCS 1010 Open Line System. REST-based north-bound API is supported for operator integration. An Optical Path Computation Engine algorithm is common across CONP and CONC and ensures consistency in network modeling and design between planning and deployment phases.
