Introduction
The Cisco bug tracking system maintains a comprehensive list of defects and vulnerabilities in Cisco products and software. Bug Search is a web-based tool that acts as a gateway to the bug tracking system and provides you with detailed defect information about your products and software.
Each bug has a unique identifier (ID). Cisco bug IDs use a pattern of CSCxxNNNNN, where x is any letter (a-z) and N is any number (0-9). These bug IDs are referenced in Software Release Notes, Security Advisories, Field Notices and other Cisco support documents. Technical Assistance Center (TAC) engineers or other Cisco staff can also provide you with bug IDs.

Access Bug Search
Anyone who has a valid Cisco.com account can access Bug Search online, but only customers and partners can utilize its advanced features. Registered users can view up to 200 bugs per month without a service contract using a Bug ID. Customers and partners who have a valid service contract can leverage advance features like Product, keyword, and release-based searches.
Note: If you do not have a profile on Cisco.com, you can obtain a login and create a user profile at the Cisco.com Registration page. After you register a Cisco.com account, you must associate a Service Contract to your Cisco.com login profile.

Product Based Search
When to Use
You have a product that runs specific software and want to research the bugs related to that device.
h4>How to Use
Choose based on Series/Model or Product ID from the 'Product' drop-down list. You can select from the list of autosuggest options for the Series/Model based search. Alternatively, you can also choose to navigate the tree and perform a selection using the "Select from List" option.
Choose a Release (as shown here) in order to further refine your search.
Note: Bugs at Cisco are not always tracked at the Cisco product model level. In these instances, all bugs at the series level impact all the models in the series.
Release Version Search
In order to further refine your search, you can also choose a Release based on whether a bug is affecting/fixed-in a specific release. The release search has autosuggest options and also allows free-form searching (that is, you can type your own version number there).
Standalone release search is also supported. This means a search can be performed with only the release name and without a keyword or product selection (as shown here).
Note: By default, your search results include bugs with all severity levels and statuses, and bugs that were modified any time in the bug life cycle. After you perform a search, you can filter your search results in order to display those with a particular Status, Severity, etc.

Sort and Filter Search Results
After you perform a search, the search results are listed below your search criteria. A preview of the bug information is shown and you can mouse over bugs to see more content about a specific bug.
You can click on any one bug title to open the Bug Details page for that bug. Before you choose the bug or bugs you want to view, there are multiple options available to browse and filter your search results table.

Search Results
The initial set of 25 search results is shown in the bottom pane. Drag the scroll bar and the next set of 25 results will automatically get loaded. Pagination of search results is not supported currently. This functionality will be available in a future release. Note - because pagination is not supported, sometimes table refresh rates can be slower if the scroll bar is adjusted too quickly.

Apply and Remove Filters
Bug Search offers powerful filtering options. You can filter your search results based on Bug Severity, Bug Status, Bug Rating, Bug Modified Date, and number of support cases.
Applying Filters
Choose an appropriate value from the drop-down list by choosing either one Filter or multiple filters from the available categories.
After each selection, the results page will automatically load under the filters pane. If you select multiple filters, it behaves like an AND condition.
For example, this filter selection would load all bugs that contain the keyword "router crash" which are fixed and have a severity of 1.
Removing Filters
To remove a particular filter, simply click the appropriate filter and choose the empty box from the drop-down list as shown:
Export Results to Excel
You can export all the bug details from your search to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet so you can view them later at your convenience. Presently, up to 10,000 bugs can be exported at a time to an Excel spreadsheet.
View Bug Details
When you click a linked bug ID in your search results list, you are taken to the Bug Details page for that bug. The Bug Details page contains information in detail about the bug.

Details Section
The details section contains information related to the bug status, severity, product, fixed/affected releases of the bug, option to download software for the fixed release, and the number of support cases associated with the bug.
You can also view the current community discussions on that bug or have an option to initiate a new discussion.
Severity
Bug Severity is usually defined from the development managers' point of view and gives the product teams ways to focus on bug fixes for their next releases. Severity is also impacted by customer priority and other details not displayed within Bug Search. This table defines bug severity levels.
Bug Severity Level Description
1 Catastrophic
Reasonably common circumstances cause the entire system to fail, or a major subsystem to stop working, or other devices on the network to be disrupted. There is no workaround.
Example: Router crashes when you enter the isdn bind-l3
iua-backhaul dpnss command.
2 Severe
Important functions are unusable, and there is no workaround, but the other functions and the rest of the network operates normally.
Example: IP helper addresses are ignored.
3 Moderate
Things fail under unusual circumstances, or minor features do not work at all, or things fail but there is a low-impact workaround. This is the highest level for documentation bugs.
Example: LAT does not work unless you have an IP address on the interface.
4 Minor
Things fail under very unusual circumstances, but operation essentially recovers without intervention. Users do not need to install any workarounds, and performance impact is tolerable.
Example: The first segment for each TCP connection is always
retransmitted.
5 Cosmetic
The defect causes no real detrimental effect on system functionality.
Example: The word "connection" is incorrectly spelled "conection" in a display.
6 Enhancement This represents a request for new functionality or for an improvement to a feature that is currently offered.

Status
Important Note: Status can change frequently throughout the lifecycle of a bug. For example, if the status is Fixed, the bug is most likely fixed in a new release of the software, as represented in the Known fixed Releases.
Status Description
Open The bug has not been fixed.
Fixed The bug has been fixed.
Other The bug is a duplicate of another bug.
Terminated A decision was made not to fix the bug.

Bug Description Content Quality Ratings
In order to assist in improving the bug description of individual bugs, Bug Search has a provision for quality ratings. Each bug will be associated with content quality information which will be an average of all rating information provided by customers. Cisco recommends that our customers provide ratings for all the bugs viewed based on bug description (for example, symptom, condition, and workaround). Bug Quality ratings are tracked at five different levels:
One star rating: Poor (1)
Two star rating: Moderate (2)
Three star rating: Medium (3)
Four star rating: Good (4)
Five star rating: Excellent (5)
Content quality information is available in the search results table and also in the Bug Details page below the description of the bug. On the bug details page, along with overall average quality information, the number of users who submitted the feedback is made available next to the rating within parenthesis. For example, in the case below, two users have rated the bug based on bug description details. You can select the star rating and provide any optional comments before you submit ratings information.
