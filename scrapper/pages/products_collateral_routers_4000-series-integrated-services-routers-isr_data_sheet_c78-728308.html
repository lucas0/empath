    These flexible interface cards support multiple integrated data and voice applications, facilitating the migration from data-only as well as circuit-switched voice services to a packet voice solution.
Introduction
The Cisco® Fourth-Generation 1-, 2-, 4-, and 8-Port T1/E1 Multiflex Trunk Voice and WAN Network Interface Modules (NIMs) support data and voice applications on the Cisco 4000 Integrated Services Routers and the Catalyst 8300 and 8200 Edge Series platforms (Figure 1). These cards combine WAN-Interface-Card (WIC), Voice-Interface-Card (VIC), ISDN Primary Rate Interface (PRI), dial-access integration, and channelized-data (CE1T1) functions to provide superior flexibility, versatility, and investment protection through their many uses. Customers who choose to integrate data and voice in multiple steps preserve their investment in a T1/E1 WAN interface.
Note:      These NIMs are not supported with Cisco 2900 and 3900 Integrated Services Routers.

Use Channelized E1/T1 for voice or data use cases in which access to individual or groups of timeslots/DS0 is required. Use Unchannelized E1/T1 in use cases when access to individual timeslots is not required, typically when used for packetized data. An Unchannelized circuit use the aggregated bandwidth from all included timeslots/DS0 as a single, concatenated, link. 2048kbps for E1 and 1544kbps for T1. Unchannelized circuits are also referred to as “Clear-channel” or “Concatenated”.
You can insert the Cisco T1/E1 NIMs into the NIM slot on the supported Cisco 4000 Integrated Services Routers (ISRs) and Catalyst 8300 and 8200 Edge Series platforms. In addition to the features listed in Table 1, these modules support both T1 and E1, providing additional flexibility for supporting T1, fractional T1, E1, and fractional E1 for both voice and WAN applications simultaneously. All modules include the drop-and-insert multiplexing capability, which eliminates costly external third-party Channel Service Units/Data Service Units (CSUs/DSUs) and drop-and-insert multiplexers.
The fourth-generation Cisco T1/E1 NIMs add improvements over the Cisco Second- and Third-Generation T1/E1 Multiflex Trunk Voice and WAN Interface Cards (MFT VWIC2s and VWIC3s, respectively). The fourth-generation T1/E1 modules enable each port to be clocked from an independent clock source for data applications. Voice applications can now be clocked independently from data applications, with all ports for voice applications clocked from a single source.
The T1/E1 modules contain an onboard Cisco Packet Voice Digital Signal Processor Module 4 (PVDM4) slot, which requires a fourth-generation PVDM4 module. A PVDM4 on the T1/E1 module is necessary for the voice features. The PVDM4 also provides for echo cancellation of up to 128-ms echo-tail length for demanding network conditions. Refer to Table 2 for all configuration options offered with the modules.
These fourth-generation modules also provide increased port density per chassis compared to the Cisco Integrated Services Routers Generation 2 (ISR G2) platform.
Key features
●      Basic T1/E1 data: The MFT versions act as WICs, supporting T1, fractional T1, E1, and fractional E1. To simplify remote management, these modules integrate a fully managed DSU/CSU for T1 deployments and a fully managed DSU for E1 deployments.
●      E1/G.703 data: In addition to the basic T1/E1 data support, the CE1T1 versions also support structured G.703 with G.704 framing and unstructured E1 (G.703) applications.
●      T1/E1 packet voice: All the modules support packet voice applications by providing T1, fractional T1, E1, and fractional E1 connections to Private Branch Exchanges (PBXs) and central offices, thereby enabling new services and reducing voice and fax toll charges. An additional onboard PVDM4 is required. Also, each NIM has its own PVDM4, so each module can be connected to a different service provider with no single clock domain restriction.
●      Mixed data and packet voice: All the modules can simultaneously support both data and voice, reducing the complexity and number of network components and facilitating a graceful migration to bandwidth-efficient packet voice.
●      Mixed data and packet voice with drop and insert: You can deploy all the modules as T1/E1 drop-and-insert multiplexers with integrated DSUs/CSUs, reducing the complexity of the network and the cost of the central-office ports by efficiently combining Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM) voice (PBX), IP voice, and data on the same trunks.
Applications
Packet Voice Solutions: PBX and Central-Office Connectivity
The modules supply PBX and Public-Switched-Telephone-Network (PSTN) connectivity for the Cisco 4000 with the onboard NIM slots. The ISRs support H.323, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP), and Skinny Client Control Protocol (SCCP)-based Voice over IP (VoIP).
Multiplexed Data and Voice Solutions: T1/E1 Drop-and-Insert Multiplexer with Integrated DSU/CSU
The Cisco fourth-generation T1/E1 modules simplify branch-office connectivity by consolidating the functions of a router, a fully managed drop-and-insert multiplexer, and a fully managed DSU/CSU into a single box. Typically a drop-and-insert multiplexer is used for channelized (that is, TDM) integration of data and voice onto a single T1, fractional T1, E1, or fractional E1 connection to the central office. Sharing a line can significantly reduce costs over those of two separate physical lines to the central office. Although the normal use is for data and voice sharing of a T1 or E1 service, you can also use the drop-and-insert capability for voice and data, or data and data sharing of the service. Moreover, the integrated drop-and-insert capability enhances system availability by allowing the Cisco IOS® Software to be reloaded while maintaining TDM switching. 56/64K Digital Data Service (DDS) function is not supported by T1/E1 NIMs.
Analog Cross-Connect Solution
You can cross-connect the TDM DS-0 channels with analog voice ports to create an analog cross-connect solution.

* channel-group refers to bonding of one or more time slots into a single High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC)-framed serial connection for IP data traffic connectivity. This connection is used for HDLC, Frame Relay, and Multilink PPP (MLPPP) serial WAN connections.
** ds0-group refers to bonding of one or more time slots into a single TDM voice connection using CAS such as Ear and Mouth (E&M), Foreign Exchange Station (FXS), or Foreign Exchange Office (FXO). This connection is used for TDM PBX or PSTN connections and typically is deployed only on T1.
*** pri-group refers to bonding of two or more time slots into a single TDM connection using ISDN signaling. This connection is typically used for TDM PBX or PSTN voice connections on T1 and E1, and also for data WAN connections on E1. Each call on the PRI is individually indicated as being a voice or data call with the ISDN bearer capability delivered with the call. Signaling is done on the D-channel, which is always channel 24 on a T1 and channel 16 on an E1.
**** tdm-group refers to cross-connecting one or more time slots from one TDM interface to another. This connection is used to groom channels from different access points onto a combined T1 or E1 uplink. Because the router merely cross-connects and does not interpret or route the traffic from the ingress interface to the egress interface, the traffic type (voice and data) is transparent to the router.
Cisco IOS XE Software release requirements
The modules are supported on the Cisco 4000 with minimum Cisco IOS XE Software Release 3.9 and on the Catalyst 8300 and 8200 series with Cisco IOS XE Software Release 17.3.
The DSP farm services (conferencing and transcoding) on the modules are supported only on Release 3.11 and above.
For platforms using ISR licensing: Data applications require the IP Base technology package, which is included by default. Voice applications require a minimum of the UC technology package, which is optional.
For platforms using DNA licensing: Data applications require the DNA Essentials subscription and Voice applications require the DNA Advantage subscription.
