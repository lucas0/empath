SUPPORT PROGRAMS
EoS refers to the time when certain products are no longer available for new purchases. It does not apply to the service and support programs for those products. Cisco will continue to support PA-100VG after EoS through Cisco SMARTnet ® and Comprehensive Maintenance programs. Customers with either of these service contracts are entitled to free software updates, 24-hour phone support through the Technical Assistance Center (TAC), and advanced hardware replacements for repairs. Comprehensive Maintenance customers also receive onsite service. Customers who do not have a maintenance contract can purchase software updates and hardware repair services from Cisco to meet specific requirements rather than full-service coverage. Cisco is committed to providing software support for a minimum of two (2) years and providing hardware support for a period of five (5) years after EoS date.
PRODUCT SUBSTITUTION
No replacement or substitute products are available.
