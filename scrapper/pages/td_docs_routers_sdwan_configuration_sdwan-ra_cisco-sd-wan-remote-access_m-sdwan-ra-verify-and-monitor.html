Chapter: Verify and Monitor SD-WAN Remote Access
Chapter Contents
On the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device hosting the SD-WAN RA headend, use the following commands to verify that the RA headend is configured and functioning.
Verification requires at least one remote user to be connected.
Client Connections
Use the show crypto session command and view the details in the “Interface: Virtual-Access” blocks in the command output. Each of these blocks corresponds to a connected client, and shows the IP address of the client and the details of the connection.
Device# show crypto session
…
Interface: Virtual-Access1
Profile: IKEV2_PROFILE
Session status: UP-ACTIVE 
Peer: 10.0.12.40 port 500 
  Session ID: 2 
  IKEv2 SA: local 10.0.31.31/500 remote 10.0.12.40/500 Active 
  IPSEC FLOW: permit ip 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 
    Active SAs: 2, origin: crypto map
IKEv2 Sessions
Use the show crypto ikev2 sa detailed command to view the details of the IKEv2 session. For each connected client, the command output includes a block similar to the one in the following example. In the output, verify that the status is READY.

Route Information
Use the show ip route vrf vrf command to view route information. Specify the VRF assigned to a client. The command output shows information regarding the routes used in the VRF. Lines containing "Virtual-Access1" or similar indicate that a client is connected.
Device# show ip route vrf 10
