Defect ID Headline
CSCvw92459 Cisco Vision Director users will not be able to launch UI
Problem Description
Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director releases listed in the Products Affected section require Adobe Flash, and full functionality requires that Adobe Flash be installed on the system and that Flash-based content is enabled.
Background
In accordance with Adobe's End-of-Life announcement, Adobe might block Flash-based content and will no longer distribute or support Flash software after 2020-12-31. In addition, third-party software updates from operating system vendors and/or browser vendors might also block Flash-based content after 2020-12-31.
Even if Flash-based content works normally after 2020-12-31, the lack of Flash maintenance updates from Adobe introduces various levels of risk that administrators should evaluate.
Cisco has migrated from Flash to alternate technologies. Refer to the Workaround/Solution section for specific details on this product.
Problem Symptom
After 2020-12-31, if Adobe Flash-based content is blocked or if Flash cannot be downloaded or installed, affected products might lose full functionality.
If Adobe Flash-based content is enabled on a system with Flash already installed, affected products might or might not continue to operate normally after 2020-12-31, depending on the organization’s operating system and browser environments.
Customers who use a Cisco Vision Dynamic Director release earlier than Release 6.3 will not be able to use the user interface to manage the Digital Media Player (DMP) endpoints.
Workaround/Solution
It is recommended to upgrade to Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director Release 6.3 in order to continue to have full support.
Cisco announced the end-of-sale and end-of-life dates for the Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director 6.1 and earlier releases.
