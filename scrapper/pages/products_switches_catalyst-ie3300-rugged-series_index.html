Features and capabilities
Modular, versatile design
The Cisco Catalyst IE3300 Rugged Series offers several modules with copper, fiber, and PoE options. The platform delivers the flexibility to adapt to your growing connectivity needs, and helps you to invest for the long term.
High-density PoE+/4PPoE managed switch
Reducing complexity with one cable for connectivity and power, the Cisco Catalyst IE3300 Rugged Series provides up to 24 ports of PoE/PoE+/4PPoE. With a power budget of 360W or 480W, it is an excellent choice to power Wi-Fi access points, pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) IP cameras, and sensors.
Fast speed, all–Gigabit Ethernet switch
Accelerate digital transformation and upgrade your IoT infrastructure to gigabit speeds. The Cisco Catalyst IE3300 Rugged Series brings you up to 10 GE uplinks and can expand to up to 26 ports of Gigabit Ethernet for a wide variety of connectivity needs.
Compact form factor for rugged switch use cases
Measuring 25 percent smaller than the Catalyst IE3000, the Cisco Catalyst IE3300 Rugged Series is easy to integrate into space- and power-constrained cabinet installations. Its rugged die-cast chassis is well suited for the harshest environments.
Open, extensible platform with IOS XE
Cisco IOS XE is the next-generation network operating system, with open and standards-based APIs and built-in multilayer security and trust. This unified software stack is superb for process and workflow automation, enabling you to qualify and deploy new network connectivity services quickly.
Support for services with IoT Operations Dashboard
Without any network changes, Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard gives you granular visibility with Cisco Cyber Vision, secure remote access with Cisco Secure Equipment Access, and process data collected by Cisco Edge Intelligence.
