Introduction
This document describes how to configure Internet Service Provider (ISP) redundancy on a Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN) spoke via the Virtual Routing and Forwarding-Lite (VRF-Lite) feature.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics before you attempt the configuration that is described in this document:
Basic knowledge of VRF

Basic knowledge of Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)

Basic knowledge of DMVPN
Components Used
The information in this document is based on Cisco IOS® Version 15.4(2)T.
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Background Information
The VRF is a technology included in the IP network routers that allows multiple instances of a routing table to coexist in a router and work simultaneously. This increases functionality because it allows the network paths to be segmented without the use of multiple devices.
The use of dual ISPs for redundancy has become a common practice. Administrators use two ISP links; one acts as a primary connection and the other acts as a backup connection.
The same concept can be implemented for DMVPN redundancy on a spoke with the use of dual ISPs. The objective of this document is to demonstrate how VRF-Lite can be used in order to segregate the routing table when a spoke has dual ISPs. Dynamic routing is used in order to provide path redundancy for the traffic that traverses the DMVPN tunnel. The configuration examples that are described in this document use this configuration schema:
Interface IP Address VRF Description
Ethernet0/0
172.16.1.1
ISP1 VRF
Primary ISP
Ethernet0/1
172.16.2.1
ISP2 VRF
Secondary ISP
With the VRF-Lite feature, multiple VPN routing/forwarding instances can be supported on the DMVPN spoke. The VRF-Lite feature forces the traffic from multiple Multipoint Generic Routing Encapsulation (mGRE) tunnel interfaces to use their respective VRF routing tables. For example, if the primary ISP terminates in the ISP1 VRF and the secondary ISP terminates in the ISP2 VRF, the traffic that is generated in the ISP2 VRF uses the ISP2 VRF routing table, while the traffic that is generated in the ISP1 VRF uses the ISP1 VRF routing table.
An advantage that comes with the use of a front door VRF (fVRF) is primarily to carve out a separate routing table from the global routing table (where tunnel interfaces exist). The advantage with the use of an inside VRF (iVRF) is to define a private space in order to hold the DMVPN and private network information. Both of these configurations provide extra security from attacks on the router from the Internet, where the routing information is separated.
These VRF configurations can be used on both the DMVPN hub and spoke. This gives great advantage over a scenario in which both of the ISPs terminate in the global routing table.
If both of the ISPs terminate in the global VRF, they share the same routing table and both of the mGRE interfaces rely on the global routing information. In this case, if the primary ISP fails, the primary ISP interface might not go down if the failure point is in the backbone network of ISPs and not directly connected. This results in a scenario where both of the mGRE tunnel interfaces still use the default route that points to the primary ISP, which causes the DMVPN redundancy to fail.
Though there are some workarounds that use IP Service Level Agreements (IP SLA) or Embedded Event Manager (EEM) scripts in order to address this issue without VRF-Lite, they might not always be the best choice.
Deployment Methods
This section provides brief overviews of split tunneling and spoke-to-spoke tunnels.
Split Tunneling
When specific subnets or summarized routes are learned via an mGRE interface, then it is called split tunneling. If the default route is learned via an mGRE interface, then it is called tunnel-all.
The configuration example that is provided in this document is based on split tunneling.
Spoke-to-Spoke Tunnels
The configuration example that is provided in this document is a good design for the tunnel-all deployment method (the default route is learned via the mGRE interface).
The use of two fVRFs segregates the routing tables and ensures that the post-GRE encapsulated packets are forwarded to the respective fVRF, which helps to ensure that the spoke-to-spoke tunnel comes up with an active ISP.
Configure
This section describes how to configure ISP redundancy on a DMVPN spoke via the VRF-Lite feature.
Note: Use the Command Lookup Tool (registered customers only) in order to obtain more information on the commands used in this section.

  Hub Configuration
Here are some notes about the relevant configuration on the hub:
In order to set Tunnel0 as the primary interface in this configuration example, the delay parameter has been changed, which allows the routes that are learned from Tunnel0 to become more preferred.

The shared keyword is used with tunnel protection and a unique tunnel key is added on all of the mGRE interfaces because they use the same tunnel source <interface>. Otherwise, the inbound Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnel packets might be punted to the incorrect tunnel interface after decryption.

A route summarization is performed in order to ensure that all of the spokes learn the default route via the mGRE tunnels (tunnel-all).
Note: Only the relevant sections of the configuration are included in this example.

Spoke Configuration
Here are some notes about the relevant configuration on the spoke:
For spoke redundancy, Tunnel0 and Tunnel1 have Ethernet0/0 and Ethernet0/1 as the tunnel source interfaces, respectively. Ethernet0/0 is connected to the primary ISP and Ethernet0/1 is connected to secondary ISP.

In order to segregate the ISPs, the VRF feature is used. The primary ISP uses the ISP1 VRF. For the secondary ISP, a VRF named ISP2 is configured.

The tunnel vrf ISP1 and tunnel vrf ISP2 are configured on interfaces Tunnel0 and Tunnel1, respectively, in order to indicate that the forwarding lookup for the post-GRE encapsulated packet is performed in either VRF ISP1 or ISP2.

In order to set Tunnel0 as the primary interface in this configuration example, the delay parameter has been changed, which allows the routes that are learned from Tunnel0 to become more preferred.
Note: Only the relevant sections of the configuration are included in this example.

Verify
Use the information that is described in this section in order to verify that your configuration works properly.
Primary and Secondary ISPs Active
In this verification scenario, both the primary and secondary ISPs are active. Here are some additional notes about this scenario:
Phase 1 and phase 2 for both of the mGRE interfaces are up.

Both of the tunnels come up, but the routes via Tunnel0 (sourced via the primary ISP) are preferred.
Here are the relevant show commands that you can use in order to verify your configuration in this scenario:
