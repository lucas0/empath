Features
Designed with you in mind
Enjoy an easy-to-use, touch-based, high-quality collaboration experience. The Board Pro integrates the most common tools needed for team collaboration in physical meeting rooms into a single elegant device.
Connect virtual teams through the app
You can story everything you create on the Board Pro in the cloud and associate it with a virtual room. Team members can use the Webex App to pick up where they left off in the physical room and continue working anywhere.
Intelligently anticipates your needs
The Board Pro automatically wakes up when you enter the room. It detects your Webex App-supported device and suggests an activity, such as call, whiteboard, or wirelessly share your presentation.
Technology for natural experiences
The powerful 4K dual camera captures a high-resolution, wide-angle image of nearly the entire room. A 12-microphone array delivers crisp, clear audio, automatically amplifying and modulating voices so that all meeting participants sound great.
Whiteboard with your entire team—local and remote
Create whiteboards with ease on the Board Pro or through the Webex App. Enjoy two-way whiteboarding, pinch/zoom and more.
