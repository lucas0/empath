    Product overview
The Cisco® Identity Services Engine (ISE) is your one-stop solution to streamline security policy management and reduce operating costs. With ISE, you can see users and devices, controlling access across wired, wireless VPN, and 5G connections to the corporate network.
Cisco Identity Services Engine powers security resilience with the flexibility and choice required to host Cisco software as workloads in multiple clouds beyond on premises support and maintain business continuity through uncertainty. This allows customers to gain a more modernized approach to deploying NAC services from the cloud. When moving from managing infrastructure in a box to leveraging infrastructure- as-code (IaC) across hybrid deployments. Teams gain agility with Zero trust provisioning and flexibility in automating their environment through the entire life cycle of managing Cisco ISE. With ISE as the centerpiece for zero trust access to the workplace (self-managed infrastructure), organizations are lowering risk, protecting the integrity of their business, and accelerating secure network access across the distributed network.
Customer advantages
Cisco ISE offers a comprehensive solution to build, manage and integrate network access security to your ecosystem of security applications. You gain many advantages when ISE is deployed, including:
Highly secure business and context-based access based on your company policies. ISE works with network devices to create an all-encompassing contextual identity with attributes such as user, time, device, device posture, location, threat, vulnerability, and access type. This identity can be used to enforce a highly secure access policy that matches the identity’s business role. IT administrators can apply precise controls over who, what, when, where, and how endpoints are allowed on the network. ISE uses multiple mechanisms to enforce policy, including Cisco Security Group software-defined segmentation.
Streamlined network visibility through a simple, flexible, and highly consumable interface. ISE stores a detailed attribute history of all the endpoints that connect to the network as well as users (including types such as guest, employee, and contractors) on the network, all the way down to endpoint application details and firewall status. All of these insights go into all network endpoints and devices that are connecting; providing visibility with context needed to assure device compliance.
Threat Containment: We are not blocking or preventing a threat from gaining access. We are turning the network into the defender, and we are closing down access, removing the endpoint form the network completely. And this level of protection can be automated with integration through pxGrid to give passive security the intelligence and analytics solutions it needs to become an active arm of defense.
Network Segmentation: network segmentation is important within balancing business objectives and maintaining protection to limit organization risks. With ISE, we are building security directly into the network, dramatically reducing the attack surface, the scope of compliance and limits the lateral movement of malware to contain threats.
Extensive and Flexible policy enforcement that defines easy, flexible access rules that meet your ever-changing business requirements. All controlled from a central location that distributes enforcement across the entire network and security infrastructure. IT administrators can centrally define a policy that differentiates guests from registered users and devices. Regardless of their location, users and endpoints are allowed access based on role and context to define intent based policies that are easy to understand. Cisco Scalable (or Security) Group Tags (SGT) allow organizations to base access control on business rules and not IP addresses or network hierarchy. This reduces operational complexity and helps to efficiently manage policies across your enterprise. These SGTs are building blocks for policies that can be defined in ISE and easily be shared to a non-Cisco infrastructure for creating their own security policies. These SGTs give users and endpoints access, on a least privilege policy, that is constantly maintained as assets and resources move across domains. Managing switch, router, and firewall rules becomes easier and has shown to help reduce IT Operations by 80% and increase time to implement changes by 98%.
Robust guest experiences that provide multiple levels of access to your network. You can provide guest access through a coffee-shop-type hotspot access, self-service registered access, or sponsored access. ISE provides you with the ability to highly customize various guest portals through an on-box or cloud-delivered portal editor that provides dynamic visual tools. You can see real-time previews of the portal screen and the experience a guest would have connecting to the network.
Self-service device onboarding for the enterprise’s Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) or guest policies. Users can manage devices according to the business policies defined by IT administrators. The IT staff will have the automated device provisioning, profiling, and posturing needed to comply with security policies. At the same time, employees can get their devices onto the network without requiring IT assistance.
Security Eco-system Integrations: Cisco ISE offers over 100+ integrations with Cisco and non-Cisco eco-system products to enable security products to share data and work together to find threats faster by automatically removing infected endpoints and protecting critical data.
Cisco DNA Center Integration
Cisco DNA Center is the foundational controller and analytics platform at the heart of Cisco’s Intent based Network. Cisco DNA Center simplifies network management and allows one to quickly set up various ISE services such as Guest and BYOD quickly and easily throughout the network, Cisco DNA Center also makes it easy to design, provision, and apply policy in minutes, not days across the network. Analytics and assurance use network insights to optimize network performance. Cisco DNA Center integrates with ISE 2.3 or later using pxGrid to deploy group based secure access and network segmentation based on business needs. With Cisco DNA Center and ISE, policy can be applied to users and applications instead of to the network devices. Security Group Policy (based on groups) provides software defined segmentation to control network access, enforce security policies, and meet compliance requirements.
Automated device-compliance checks for device-posture and remediation options using Cisco Secure Client (formerly Anyconnect agent), Temporal and Agentless options with custom scripts support. Cisco Secure Client Temporal and Agentless are two different ways to gather posture from endpoints beyond a full agent. Agentless option is supported from ISE 3.0 onwards lo Cisco Secure client also provide advanced VPN services for desktop and laptop checks. ISE also integrates with market-leading Mobile Device Management/Enterprise Mobility Management (MDM/EMM) vendors. MDM integration helps ensure that a mobile device is both secure and policy compliant before it is given access to the network.
The ability to share user and device context and to contain threats throughout the network. Cisco pxGrid (Platform Exchange Grid) technology is a robust platform that you can use to share a deep level of contextual data about connected users and devices with Cisco and Cisco Security Technical Alliance solutions. ISE’s network and security partners use this data to improve their own network access capabilities and accelerate their ability to identify, mitigate, and rapidly contain threats.
Central network device management using TACACS+. Cisco ISE allows you to manage network devices using the TACACS+ security protocol to control and audit the configuration of network devices. ISE facilitates granular control of who can access which network device and change the associated network settings.

Integrated solutions
Cisco pxGrid is a highly scalable IT clearinghouse for multiple security tools to communicate automatically with each other in real time. With Cisco ISE 2.4 we introduced pxGrid 2.0, which provides a new WebSockets client and removes dependencies on underlying operating systems and languages. More than 50 integrations are available from Cisco and third-party vendors, notably Cisco Industrial Network Director (IND), which uses pxGrid to provide OT endpoint information to ISE. Additionally, pxGrid is used to share IP-to-SGT information about endpoints allowing security products to apply Security Group access control using SGTs. With ISE 3.1, pxGrid 1.0 connections are no longer supported.
As an extension to the prior Cisco ISE 3.2 release, with the Cisco ISE 3.3 release pxGrid Direct Visibility has improved visibility of attributes gathered from external databases such as ServiceNow. This allows network administrators to easily view the content gathered by any endpoints across all of the different soruces. This provides a lot of information on the endpoints, users and devices, including which apps are running over the network and the different attributes— such as the device owner and type and whether the device is operational.
Customers can then take this data and use it to more efficiently run their network, such as creating an ISE authorization policy.
Cisco Rapid Threat Containment (RTC) simplifies and automates network mitigation and investigation actions in response to security events. It integrates Cisco ISE and Cisco security technology partner solutions in a broad variety of technology areas. With Threat-Centric Network Access Control (TC-NAC), it can change user access based on CVSS vulnerability and STIX threat scores. With the Cisco pxGrid Adaptive Network Control (ANC), it gives you the ability to reset the network access status of an endpoint to quarantine, unquarantine, bounce, or shut down a port.
