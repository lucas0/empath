Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure that you have the following data at your disposal:

Moving Licenses Between Devices for Identity Services Engine (ISE)
Step 1: 
Go to Cisco Software Central and log in with your Cisco.com account.
Step 2:
In the Traditional Licenses section, click Access LRP.
Step 3:
In the Show Smart Account and Virtual Account drop-down lists, confirm that the correct respective accounts are selected.
Note: If the system displays the Welcome To The License Registration Portal alert dialog box, you can select Do not show this message again to prevent it from being displayed again.
Step 4:
On the Devices tab, select the source device from which you need to move the license(s) to the target device. Click the blue circled chevron icon and select Move Licenses Between Devices.
Note: If you cannot find the source device information on the Devices tab, you need to add the source device to the list by clicking the Add Devices button.
Step 5:
On the Move Licenses Between Devices page, in the Move Licenses from this Source Device section, from the Returning Device drop-down list select the following option:
Yes if you have a failed device that you need to replace and you want to move the license(s) to the new device. After you select Yes, the system displays an RMA Number field in which you can enter the number of your RMA request.
No if you need to move licenses between devices for a reason other than a device replacement.
Click Next.
Step 6:
In the Move Licenses to this Destination Device section, enter Primary Product Id and Primary Serial No of the device to which you need to move the license(s). Optionally, you can also confirm that a correct Smart and Virtual Account is selected. Click Next.
Note: The information requested in the Move Licenses to this Destination Device section varies depending on a product for which you need to move the license(s).
Note: If the system prompts you to fill in the Primary Version ID field, then you can obtain it by typing show udi command in the command-line interface (CLI) or by clicking About in the Policy Administration Point (PAP).
Step 7:
In the Select the Licenses to be Moved section, enter the number of licenses you need to move to a target device, and then click Next.
Note: For some license types you can only select a single license transaction to move all of the licenses over to a target device as demonstrated in the example in the screenshot.
Step 8:
In the Review the Licenses to be Moved section, verify that the Source and Destination Device as well as Source and Destination License(s) and their Quantity are correct. In the Send Licenses To section, you can edit the End User and Email Addresses, to which you need to send the license information. Click Submit.
Step 9:
In the Next Steps section, the system displays a confirmation message about successfully generated license files for the destination device. To download the license(s), click the Download Licenses button. You should also receive the license files to your email within an hour from submitting the License Agreement. 
Caution: Since the email with the license files is sent from do-not-reply@cisco.com, ensure that you check your junk email folder.
Troubleshooting
If you experience an issue during the process of moving licenses between devices or in case you need to add or change the secondary device information, open a case inSupport Case Manager (SCM). 
Next Steps
After you receive a license key file, refer to the product configuration guide for license installation and guidance. If you experience an issue with your installation, contact Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC).
