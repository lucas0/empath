Introduction
This document describes DHCP relay on Cisco ASA with the help of packet captures and debugs, and provides a configuration example.
Prerequisites
A Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) relay agent allows the security appliance to forward DHCP requests from clients to a router or other DHCP server connected to a different interface.

These restrictions apply only to the use of the DHCP relay agent:
The relay agent cannot be enabled if the DHCP server feature is also enabled.
You must be directly connected to the security appliance and cannot send requests through another relay agent or a router.
For multiple context mode, you cannot enable DHCP relay, or configure a DHCP relay server, on an interface that is used by more than one context.
DHCP relay services are not available in transparent firewall mode. A security appliance in transparent firewall mode only allows Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) traffic through. All other traffic requires an Access Control List (ACL). In order to allow DHCP requests and replies through the security appliance in transparent mode, you must configure two ACLs:
One ACL that allows DHCP requests from the inside interface to the outside.
One ACL that allows the replies from the server in the other direction.
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have a basic knowledge of ASA CLI and Cisco IOSÂ® CLI.
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
ASA 5500-x Series Security Appliance Release 9.x or later
Cisco 1800 Series Routers
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Background Information
The DHCP protocol supplies automatic configuration parameters, such as an IP address with a subnet mask, default gateway, DNS server address, and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) address to hosts. Initially, DHCP clients have none of these configuration parameters. In order to obtain this information, they send a broadcast request for it. When a DHCP server sees this request, the DHCP server supplies the necessary information. Due to the nature of these broadcast requests, the DHCP client and server must be on the same subnet. Layer 3 devices such as routers and firewalls do not typically forward these broadcast requests by default.
An attempt to locate DHCP clients and a DHCP server on the same subnet is not always convenient. In such a situation, you can use DHCP relay. When the DHCP relay agent on the security appliance receives a DHCP request from a host on an inside interface, it forwards the request to one of the specified DHCP servers on an outside interface. When the DHCP server replies to the client, the security appliance forwards that reply back. Thus, the DHCP relay agent acts as a proxy for the DHCP client in its conversation with the DHCP server. 
Packet Flow
This image illustrates the DHCP packet flow when a DHCP relay agent is not used:
The ASA intercepts these packets and wraps them into DHCP relay format: 
DHCP Relay with Packet Captures on the ASA Inside and Outside Interface
Make a note of content highligted in RED, because that is how the ASA modifies various fields.
In order to start the DHCP process, boot the system and send a broadcast message (DHCPDISCOVER) to the destination address 255.255.255.255  - UDP port 67.



Note: If a VPN client requests an IP address, the relay-agent IP address is the first usable IP address that is defined by the dhcp-network-scope command, under the group-policy.


Normally, ASA would drop the broadcast, but because it is configured to act as a DHCP relay, it forwards the DHCPDISCOVER message as a unicast packet to the DHCP server's IP sourcing from the interface IP that faces the server. In this case, it is the outside interface IP address. Notice the change in the IP header and relay agent field:



Note: Due to the fix incorporated in Cisco bug ID CSCuo89924, ASA in Versions 9.1(5.7), 9.3(1), and later can forward the unicast packets to the DHCP server's IP sourcing from the interface IP address that faces the client (giaddr) where the dhcprelay is enabled. In this case, it can be the inside interface IP address.


The server sends back a DHCPOFFER message as a unicast packet to the ASA, destined to the relay agent IP set up in DHCPDISCOVER- UDP port 67. In this case, it is the IP address of the inside interface (giaddr), where dhcprelay is enabled. Notice the destination IP in the layer 3 header:



ASA sends this packet out of the inside interface - UDP port 68. Notice the change in the IP header while the packet leaves the inside interface:



Once you receive the DHCPOFFER message, send a DHCPREQUEST message in order to indicate that you accept the offer.



ASA passes the DHCPREQUEST to the DHCP server.



Once the server gets the DHCPREQUEST, it sends the DHCPACK back in order to confirm the offered IP.



ASA passes the DHCPACK from the DHCP server to you, and that completes the transaction.

Debugs and Syslogs for DHCP Relay Transactions
This is a DHCP request forwarded to DHCP server interface 198.51.100.2:
DHCPRA: relay binding created for client 0050.5684.396a.DHCPD: 
 setting giaddr to 192.0.2.1.

dhcpd_forward_request: request from 0050.5684.396a forwarded to 198.51.100.2.

DHCPRA: relay binding found for client 0050.5684.396a.
DHCPRA: Adding rule to allow client to respond using offered address 192.0.2.4
After the reply is received from the DHCP server, the security appliance forwards it to the DHCP client with MAC address 0050.5684.396a, and changes the gateway address to its own inside interface.
DHCPRA: forwarding reply to client 0050.5684.396a.

DHCPRA: exchange complete - relay binding deleted for client 0050.5684.396a.

DHCP Relay with Multiple DHCP Servers
You can define up to ten DHCP servers. When a client sends a DHCP Discover packet, it is forwarded to all of the DHCP servers.
Here is an example:
dhcprelay server 198.51.100.2 outside
dhcprelay server 198.51.100.3 outside
dhcprelay server 198.51.100.4 outside
dhcprelay enable inside
dhcprelay setroute inside
Debugs with Multiple DHCP Servers
Here are some example debugs when multiple DHCP servers are used:
DHCP: Received a BOOTREQUEST from interface 2 (size = 300)
DHCPRA: relay binding found for client 000c.291c.34b5.
DHCPRA: setting giaddr to 192.0.2.1.
dhcpd_forward_request: request from 000c.291c.34b5 forwarded to 198.51.100.2.
dhcpd_forward_request: request from 000c.291c.34b5 forwarded to 198.51.100.3.
dhcpd_forward_request: request from 000c.291c.34b5 forwarded to 198.51.100.4.
Captures with Multiple DHCP Servers
Here is an example packet capture when multiple DHCP servers are used:
ASA# show cap out

3 packets captured

 1: 18:48:41.211628       192.0.2.1.67 > 198.51.100.2.67:  udp 300 
 2: 18:48:41.211689       192.0.2.1.67 > 198.51.100.3.67:  udp 300 
 3: 18:48:41.211704       192.0.2.1.67 > 198.51.100.4.67:  udp 300
