Remote Docker Workflow Page
The Remote Docker Workflow page provides access from your local PC to Docker apps on the host system so that you can develop, test, and troubleshooting these apps. If an app is deployed, you can enable access to the app from this page. If an app is not deployed, you can create a Docker app profile from this page. You also can generate and download a package.yaml file for an app from this page, and view information about Docker artifacts (containers, images, and volumes) that are on the host system.
Remote Docker access is intended for use by developers. Operators do not need to use this feature.
To access the Remote Docker Workflow page, choose Remote Docker Workflow from the Cisco IOx Local Manager menu bar. If the options on this page are hidden, click Remote Docker Workflow at the top of the page.
The following table describes the fields and options that are available on this page. If Remote Docker Access is disabled on this page, only the Remote Docker Access field and the Enable Remote Docker Access buttons are available. The options that display on this page depend on the procedure you are performing. For example, the Docker Runtime options and the Usage options do not display when you are adding a Docker app profile.
Using the options on this page requires that the host system supports the native Docker engine.
For more detailed information about how to use the options on this page, see the Remote Docker App Workflow section.
