Introduction
This sample configuration sets up an EtherChannel between a Cisco Catalyst 6500 that runs Catalyst OS (CatOS) and a Catalyst 3500XL switch. EtherChannel can be called Fast EtherChannel (FEC) or Gigabit EtherChannel (GEC). The name depends on the speed of interfaces or ports that you use to form the EtherChannel. You can use any of these switches in this scenario in order to obtain the same results:
Any Catalyst 4500/4000, 5500/5000, or 6500/6000 series switch that runs CatOS
Any of the Catalyst Layer 2 (L2) fixed configuration 2900XL or 3500XL series switches
In this document, two Fast Ethernet ports from each of the switches are bundled into an FEC. In this document, the terms "FEC", "GEC", "port channel", "channel", and "port group" all refer to EtherChannel.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Ensure that you meet these requirements before you attempt this configuration:
Familiarity with the commands to use in order to configure EtherChannel on a Catalyst 2900XL or 3500XL switch
For more information on the commands, refer to the Configuring the Switch Ports section of  the document Catalyst 2900 XL and Catalyst 3500 XL Software Configuration Guide, 12.0(5)WC5, 12.0(5)WC6.
Familiarity with the commands to use in order to configure EtherChannel on a switch that runs CatOS
For more information on the commands, refer to the Configuring EtherChannel section of the document Catalyst 6500 Series Software Configuration Guide, 8.7.
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
Catalyst 3500XL switch (model WS-C3524-PWR-XL-EN) that runs Cisco IOS® Software Release 12.0(5)WC9
Catalyst 6500 switch (model 6506 with Supervisor Engine II) that runs CatOS software version 8.2.1
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Conventions
Refer to Cisco Technical Tips Conventions for more information on document conventions.
Background Information
You must manually create EtherChannel because Catalyst 2900XL/3500XL switches do not support Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP); CatOS switches support PAgP. PAgP facilitates the automatic creation of FEC and GEC. For more information on PAgP, refer to the Configuring EtherChannel section of the document Catalyst 6500 Series Software Configuration Guide, 8.7.
Create the port channel in the order of these steps:
Note: When you perform the steps in this order, you avoid possible problems with Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) that can occur during the configuration process. STP can shut down ports with the errdisable status on the Catalyst 6500 switch if you configure the CatOS switch as a channel before you configure the XL switch as a channel.
Issue the set port disable module/port command on the CatOS switch.
The command sets to disable mode the ports for use in port channeling.
Create the port channel (port group) on the XL switch.
Create the port channel on the CatOS switch.
Note: Be sure to set the channel mode to "on". This setting is necessary in order to disable PAgP on the ports and to force the ports to form a channel.
Issue the set port enable module/port command on the CatOS switch.
The command reenables the ports that were disabled earlier.

In this section, you are presented with the information to configure the features described in this document.
