Product Overview
The Cisco RF Gateway 1 is a standards-based universal edge QAM (U-EQAM) solution for convergence of high-speed and high-bandwidth data and video distribution at the edge of the cable access network. The Cisco RF Gateway 1 offers leading edge density, modularity, and flexibility with support for Switched Digital Video (SDV), VoD, Broadcast Video, and DOCSIS® 3.0/Modular CMTS (M-CMTS)™ all on a single QAM platform.
The Cisco RF Gateway 1 provides higher density (up to 96 QAMs per RU), improved reliability, superior RF performance, 1 GHz RF output, and DOCSIS 3.0/M-CMTS capability. It is fully integrated and tested as part of the Cisco Digital Broadband Delivery System (DBDS) and the Cisco uBR10012 M-CMTS solution, accelerating the deployment and easing the management of digital video and DOCSIS services. The Cisco RF Gateway 1 enables the converged next-generation cable access network by offering comprehensive video and DOCSIS functions in a single U-EQAM platform.

Features and Benefits
Primary Benefits
The compact Cisco RF Gateway 1 provides the following benefits for cable operators:
●   Rapid time-to-market of QAM-based services to generate incremental revenue through a modular, flexible design based on a proven, fourth-generation QAM architecture
●   Efficient use of capital expenditures through maximum spectrum efficiency (SDV, QAM Sharing, 1 GHz) and U-EQAM functionality (video and data) for flexibility and optimization in a variety of video and data network architectures
●   Quality and reliability through a redundant architecture; full testing and integration with the Cisco DBDS Video Delivery System and the Cisco uBR10012 M-CMTS Architecture
Primary Features
The Cisco RF Gateway 1 provides up to 96 U-EQAM channels (for SDV, Broadcast, VoD, and DOCSIS 3.0/M-CMTS) in a compact 1 RU chassis. The modular design supports 16 QAM channels per module, with eight QAM channels per RF output port and frequency agility up to 1 GHz.
Primary features include:
●   True U-EQAM video (broadcast, SDV, SD/HD, MPEG-2, AVC) and high speed data
●   (M-CMTS/DTI, DOCSIS 3.0) in 1 RU form factor
●   Manual or DEPI Control Plane modes supported
●   Table-based or session-based video functionality
●   Optional on-board Encryption: DVB® SimulCrypt and PowerKEY® SKS
●   Utilizes Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) QAM technology which allows superior RF performance and stability
●   96 configurable QAM channels; each of which is fully agile 45–1000 MHz
●   RF performance typically meets or exceeds CableLabs®DRFI specification CM-SP-DRFI
●   Modular, hot-swappable, and Auto-configurable QAM cards
●   Support for up to 2048 streams in 1 RU
●   Fully redundant design with redundant Gigabit Ethernet ports and power supplies (AC/AC, AC/DC, or DC/DC)
●   Front-to-back airflow to allow self-cooling and stacking
●   Compliance with ITU-T J.83 standard, Annex A (DVB), Annex B (ATSC), or Annex C (Japan)
●   Internet Group Management Protocol Version 3 (IGMPv3) support
●   Low power consumption per QAM
●   Four or eight QAM channels per RF port available - independent of channel bandwidth (6, 7, and 8 MHz)
