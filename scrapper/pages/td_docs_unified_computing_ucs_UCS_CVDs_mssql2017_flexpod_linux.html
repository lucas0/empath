Cisco Unified Computing System
Cisco Unified Computing System is a next-generation solution for blade and rack server computing. The system integrates a low-latency; lossless 40 Gigabit Ethernet unified network fabric with enterprise-class, x86-architecture servers. The system is an integrated, scalable, multi-chassis platform in which all resources participate in a unified management domain. Cisco Unified Computing System accelerates the delivery of new services simply, reliably, and securely through end-to-end provisioning and migration support for both virtualized and non-virtualized systems. Cisco Unified Computing System provides:
Â·         Comprehensive Management
Â·         Radical Simplification
Â·         High Performance
Cisco Unified Computing System consists of the following components:
Â·         Compute - The system is based on an entirely new class of computing system that incorporates rack mount and blade servers based on Intel Xeon scalable processors product family.
Â·         Network - The system is integrated onto a low-latency, lossless, 40-Gbps unified network fabric. This network foundation consolidates Local Area Networks (LANs), Storage Area Networks (SANs), and high-performance computing networks, which are separate networks today. The unified fabric lowers costs by reducing the number of network adapters, switches, and cables, and by decreasing the power and cooling requirements.
Â·         Virtualization - The system unleashes the full potential of virtualization by enhancing the scalability, performance, and operational control of virtual environments. Cisco security, policy enforcement, and diagnostic features are now extended into virtualized environments to better support changing business and IT requirements.
Â·         Storage access - The system provides consolidated access to both SAN storage and Network Attached Storage (NAS) over the unified fabric. It is also an ideal system for Software defined Storage (SDS). Combining the benefits of single framework to manage both the compute and Storage servers in a single pane, Quality of Service (QOS) can be implemented if needed to inject IO throttling in the system. In addition, the server administrators can pre-assign storage-access policies to storage resources, for simplified storage connectivity and management leading to increased productivity. In addition to external storage, both rack and blade servers have internal storage which can be accessed through built-in hardware RAID controllers. With storage profile and disk configuration policy configured in Cisco UCS Manager, storage needs for the host OS and application data gets fulfilled by user defined RAID groups for high availability and better performance.
Â·         Management - the system uniquely integrates all system components to enable the entire solution to be managed as a single entity by Cisco UCS Manager. Cisco UCS Manager has an intuitive GUI, a CLI, and a powerful scripting library module for Microsoft PowerShell built on a robust API to manage all system configuration and operations.
Cisco Unified Computing System fuses access layer networking and servers. This high-performance, next-generation server system provides a data center with a high degree of workload agility and scalability.
Cisco UCS Manager
Cisco UCS Manager (UCSM) provides unified, embedded management for all software and hardware components in the Cisco UCS. Using Single Connect technology, it manages, controls, and administers multiple chassis for thousands of virtual machines. Administrators use the software to manage the entire Cisco Unified Computing System as a single logical entity through an intuitive GUI, CLI, or an XML API. Cisco UCS Manager resides on a pair of Cisco UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects using a clustered, active-standby configuration for high availability.
Cisco UCS Manager offers unified embedded management interface that integrates server, network, and storage. Cisco UCS Manager performs auto-discovery to detect inventory, manage, and provision system components that are added or changed. It offers comprehensive set of XML API for third part integration, exposes 9000 points of integration and facilitates custom development for automation, orchestration, and to achieve new levels of system visibility and control.
Service profiles benefit both virtualized and non-virtualized environments and increase the mobility of non-virtualized servers, such as when moving workloads from server to server or taking a server offline for service or upgrade. Profiles can also be used in conjunction with virtualization clusters to bring new resources online easily, complementing existing virtual machine mobility.

Cisco UCS Fabric Extenders
Cisco UCS 2304 Fabric Extender brings the unified fabric into the blade server enclosure, providing multiple 40 Gigabit Ethernet connections between blade servers and the fabric interconnect, simplifying diagnostics, cabling, and management. It is a third-generation I/O Module (IOM) that shares the same form factor as the second-generation Cisco UCS 2200 Series Fabric Extenders and is backward compatible with the shipping Cisco UCS 5108 Blade Server Chassis. The Cisco UCS 2304 connects the I/O fabric between the Cisco UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects and the Cisco UCS 5100 Series Blade Server Chassis, enabling a lossless and deterministic Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) fabric to connect all blades and chassis together. Because the fabric extender is similar to a distributed line card, it does not perform any switching and is managed as an extension of the fabric interconnects. This approach reduces the overall infrastructure complexity and enabling Cisco UCS to scale to many chassis without multiplying the number of switches needed, reducing TCO and allowing all chassis to be managed as a single, highly available management domain.
The Cisco UCS 2304 Fabric Extender has four 40Gigabit Ethernet, FCoE-capable, Quad Small Form-Factor Pluggable (QSFP+) ports that connect the blade chassis to the fabric interconnect. Each Cisco UCS 2304 can provide one 40 Gigabit Ethernet ports connected through the midplane to each half-width slot in the chassis, giving it a total eight 40G interfaces to the compute. Typically configured in pairs for redundancy, two fabric extenders provide up to 320 Gbps of I/O to the chassis.

Cisco UCS Differentiators
Cisco Unified Computing System is revolutionizing the way servers are managed in the data center. The following are the unique differentiators of Cisco UCS and Cisco UCS Manager:
Â·         Embedded ManagementâIn Cisco UCS, the servers are managed by the embedded firmware in the Fabric Interconnects, eliminating need for any external physical or virtual devices to manage the servers.
Â·         Unified FabricâIn Cisco UCS, from blade server chassis or rack servers to FI, there is a single Ethernet cable used for LAN, SAN and management traffic. This converged I/O results in reduced cables, SFPs and adapters which in turn reduce capital and operational expenses of the overall solution.
Â·         Auto DiscoveryâBy simply inserting the blade server in the chassis or connecting rack server to the fabric interconnect, discovery and inventory of compute resource occurs automatically without any management intervention. The combination of unified fabric and auto-discovery enables the wire-once architecture of Cisco UCS, where its compute capability can be extended easily while keeping the existing external connectivity to LAN, SAN and management networks.
Â·         Policy Based Resource ClassificationâWhen a compute resource is discovered by Cisco UCS Manager, it can be automatically classified to a given resource pool based on policies defined. This capability is useful in multi-tenant cloud computing. This CVD showcases the policy-based resource classification of Cisco UCS Manager.
Â·         Combined Rack and Blade Server ManagementâCisco UCS Manager can manage B-Series blade servers and C-Series rack server under the same Cisco UCS domain. This feature, along with stateless computing makes compute resources truly hardware form factor agnostic.
Â·         Model-based Management ArchitectureâCisco UCS Manager Architecture and management database is model based and data driven. An open XML API is provided to operate on the management model. This enables easy and scalable integration of Cisco UCS Manager with other management systems.
Â·         Policies, Pools, TemplatesâThe management approach in Cisco UCS Manager is based on defining policies, pools and templates, instead of cluttered configuration, which enables a simple, loosely coupled, data driven approach in managing compute, network and storage resources.
Â·         Loose Referential IntegrityâIn Cisco UCS Manager, a service profile, port profile or policies can refer to other policies or logical resources with loose referential integrity. A referred policy cannot exist at the time of authoring the referring policy or a referred policy can be deleted even though other policies are referring to it. This provides different subject matter experts to work independently from each-other. This provides great flexibility where different experts from different domains, such as network, storage, security, server and virtualization work together to accomplish a complex task.
Â·         Policy ResolutionâIn Cisco UCS Manager, a tree structure of organizational unit hierarchy can be created that mimics the real-life tenants and/or organization relationships. Various policies, pools and templates can be defined at different levels of organization hierarchy. A policy referring to another policy by name is resolved in the organization hierarchy with closest policy match. If no policy with specific name is found in the hierarchy of the root organization, then special policy named âdefaultâ is searched. This policy resolution practice enables automation friendly management APIs and provides great flexibility to owners of different organizations.
Â·         Service Profiles and Stateless Computingâa service profile is a logical representation of a server, carrying its various identities and policies. This logical server can be assigned to any physical compute resource as far as it meets the resource requirements. Stateless computing enables procurement of a server within minutes, which used to take days in legacy server management systems.
Â·         Built-in Multi-Tenancy SupportâThe combination of policies, pools and templates, loose referential integrity, policy resolution in organization hierarchy and a service profiles based approach to compute resources makes Cisco UCS Manager inherently friendly to multi-tenant environment typically observed in private and public clouds.
Â·         Extended Memoryâthe enterprise-class Cisco UCS B200 M5 blade server extends the capabilities of Ciscoâs Unified Computing System portfolio in a half-width blade form factor. The Cisco UCS B200 M5 harnesses the power of the latest Intel Xeon scalable processors product family CPUs with up to 3 TB of RAMâ allowing huge virtual machine-to-physical server ratio required in many deployments or allowing large memory operations required by certain architectures like Big-Data.
Â·         Virtualization Aware NetworkâVM-FEX technology makes the access network layer aware about host virtualization. This prevents domain pollution of compute and network domains with virtualization when virtual network is managed by port-profiles defined by the network administratorsâ team. VM-FEX also off-loads hypervisor CPU by performing switching in the hardware, thus allowing hypervisor CPU to do more virtualization related tasks. VM-FEX technology is well integrated with VMware vCenter, Linux KVM and Hyper-V SR-IOV to simplify cloud management.
Â·         Simplified QoSâEven though Fiber Channel and Ethernet are converged in Cisco UCS fabric, built-in support for QoS and lossless Ethernet makes it seamless. Network Quality of Service (QoS) is simplified in Cisco UCS Manager by representing all system classes in one GUI panel.
Cisco Nexus 93180YC-EX Switches
In this solution, the Cisco Nexus 93180YC-EX Switches are used as upstream switches. It offers 48 1/10/25/40/100 Gigabit Ethernet SFP+ ports and 6 40/100-Gbps QSFP+ uplink ports. All ports are line rate, delivering 3.6 Tbps of throughput with a latency of less than 2 micro seconds in a 1-rack-unit (1RU) form factor.

NetApp AFF A300 Storage
With the new A-Series All Flash FAS (AFF) controller lineup, NetApp provides industry leading performance while continuing to provide a full suite of enterprise-grade data management and data protection features. The A-Series lineup offers double the IOPS, while decreasing the latency.
This solution utilizes the NetApp AFF A300. This controller provides the high performance benefits of 40GbE and all flash SSDs, while taking up only 5U of rack space. Configured with 24 x 3.8TB SSD, the A300 provides ample performance and over 60TB effective capacity. This makes it an ideal controller for a shared workload converged infrastructure. For situations where more performance is needed, the A700s would be an ideal fit.
Figure 5  NetApp AFF A300
NetApp ONTAP 9.5
ONTAP 9.5 is the data management software that is used with the NetApp all-flash storage platforms in the solution design. ONTAP software offers unified storage for applications that read and write data over block or file-access protocols in storage configurations that range from high-speed flash to lower-priced spinning media or cloud-based object storage.
ONTAP implementations can run on NetApp engineered FAS or AFF appliances, on commodity hardware (ONTAP Select), and in private, public, or hybrid clouds (NetApp Private Storage and Cloud Volumes ONTAP). Specialized implementations offer best-in-class converged infrastructure as featured here as part of the FlexPod Datacenter solution and access to third-party storage arrays (NetApp FlexArray virtualization).
Together these implementations form the basic framework of the NetApp Data Fabric, with a common software-defined approach to data management and fast, efficient replication across platforms. FlexPod and ONTAP architectures can serve as the foundation for both hybrid cloud and private cloud designs.
The following few sections provide an overview of how ONTAP 9.5 is an industry-leading data management software architected on the principles of software defined storage.
NetApp Storage Virtual Machine
A NetApp ONTAP cluster serves data through at least one and possibly multiple storage virtual machines (SVMs; formerly called Vservers). An SVM is a logical abstraction that represents the set of physical resources of the cluster. Data volumes and network logical interfaces (LIFs) are created and assigned to an SVM and might reside on any node in the cluster to which the SVM has been given access. An SVM might own resources on multiple nodes concurrently, and those resources can be moved non-disruptively from one node in the storage cluster to another. For example, a NetApp FlexVol flexible volume can be non-disruptively moved to a new node and aggregate, or a data LIF can be transparently reassigned to a different physical network port. The SVM abstracts the cluster hardware, and thus it is not tied to any specific physical hardware.
An SVM can support multiple data protocols concurrently. Volumes within the SVM can be joined together to form a single NAS namespace, which makes all of an SVM's data available through a single share or mount point to NFS and CIFS clients. SVMs also support block-based protocols, and LUNs can be created and exported by using iSCSI, FC, or FCoE. Any or all of these data protocols can be configured for use within a given SVM. Storage administrators and management roles can also be associated with SVM, which enables higher security and access control, particularly in environments with more than one SVM, when the storage is configured to provide services to different groups or set of workloads.
Storage Efficiencies
Storage efficiency has always been a primary architectural design point of ONTAP data management software. A wide array of features allows you to store more data using less space. In addition to deduplication and compression, you can store your data more efficiently by using features such as unified storage, multitenancy, thin provisioning, and utilize NetApp Snapshot technology.
Starting with ONTAP 9, NetApp guarantees that the use of NetApp storage efficiency technologies on AFF systems reduce the total logical capacity used to store customer data by 75 percent, a data reduction ratio of 4:1. This space reduction is enabled by a combination of several different technologies, including deduplication, compression, and compaction.
Compaction, which was introduced in ONTAP 9, is the latest patented storage efficiency technology released by NetApp. In the ONTAP WAFL file system, all I/O takes up 4KB of space, even if it does not actually require 4KB of data. Compaction combines multiple blocks that are not using their full 4KB of space together into one block. This one block can be more efficiently stored on the disk to save space.
Encryption
Data security continues to be an important consideration for customers purchasing storage systems. NetApp supported self-encrypting drives in storage clusters prior to ONTAP 9. However, in ONTAP 9, the encryption capabilities of ONTAP are extended by adding an Onboard Key Manager (OKM). The OKM generates and stores keys for each of the drives in ONTAP, allowing ONTAP to provide all functionality required for encryption out of the box. Through this functionality, sensitive data stored on disk is secure and can only be accessed by ONTAP.
Beginning with ONTAP 9.1, NetApp has extended the encryption capabilities further with NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE), a software-based mechanism for encrypting data. It allows a user to encrypt data at the per-volume level instead of requiring encryption of all data in the cluster, thereby providing more flexibility and granularity to the ONTAP administrators. This encryption extends to Snapshot copies and NetApp FlexClone volumes that are created in the cluster. One benefit of NVE is that it runs after the implementation of the storage efficiency features, and, therefore, it does not interfere with the ability of ONTAP to create space savings.
For more information about encryption in ONTAP, see the NetApp Power Encryption Guide in the NetApp ONTAP 9 Documentation Center.
FlexClone
NetApp FlexClone technology enables instantaneous cloning of a dataset without consuming any additional storage until cloned data differs from the original.
SnapMirror (Data Replication)
NetApp SnapMirror is a replication technology for data replication across different sites, or within the same datacenter, or on-the-premises datacenter to cloud, or cloud to on-the-premises datacenter.
NetApp SnapCenter
SnapCenter is a NetApp next-generation data protection software for tier 1 enterprise applications. SnapCenter, with its single-pane-of-glass management interface, automates and simplifies the manual, complex, and time-consuming processes associated with the backup, recovery, and cloning of multiple databases and other application workloads.
SnapCenter leverages technologies, including NetApp Snapshot copies, SnapMirror replication technology, SnapRestore data recovery software, and FlexClone thin cloning technology, that allow it to integrate seamlessly with technologies offered by Oracle, Microsoft, SAP, VMware, and MongoDB across FC, iSCSI, and NAS protocols. This integration allows IT organizations to scale their storage infrastructure, meet increasingly stringent SLA commitments, and improve the productivity of administrators across the enterprise.
SnapCenter is used in this solution for backup and restore of VMware virtual machines. SnapCenter has the capability to backup and restore SQL databases running on Windows OS. SnapCenter currently does not support SQL Server running on Linux OS, but that functionality is coming in near future. SnapCenter does not support the backup and restore of virtual machines running on Hyper-V. For Hyper-V virtual machine backup, NetApp SnapManager for Hyper-V can be used.
SnapCenter Architecture
SnapCenter is a centrally managed web-based application that runs on a Windows platform and remotely manages multiple servers that must be protected.
Figure 6 illustrates the high-level architecture of the NetApp SnapCenter Server.
Figure 6  SnapCenter Architecture
The SnapCenter Server has an HTML5-based GUI as well as PowerShell cmdlets and APIs.
The SnapCenter Server is high-availability capable out of the box, meaning that if one SnapCenter host is ever unavailable for any reason, then the second SnapCenter Server can seamlessly take over and no operations are affected.
The SnapCenter Server can push out plug-ins to remote hosts. These plug-ins are used to interact with an application, a database, or a file system. In most cases, the plug-ins must be present on the remote host  so that application- or database-level commands can be issued from the same host where the application or database is running.
To manage the plug-ins and the interaction between the SnapCenter Server and the plug-in host, SnapCenter uses SM Service, which is a NetApp SnapManager web service running on top of Windows Server Internet Information Services (IIS) on the SnapCenter Server. SM Service takes all client requests such as backup, restore, clone, and so on.
The SnapCenter Server communicates those requests to SMCore, which is a service that runs co-located within the SnapCenter Server and remote servers and plays a significant role in coordinating with the SnapCenter plug-ins package for Windows. The package includes the SnapCenter plug-in for Microsoft Windows Server and SnapCenter plug-in for Microsoft SQL Server to discover the host file system, gather database metadata, quiesce and thaw, and manage the SQL Server database during backup, restore, clone, and verification.
SnapCenter Virtualization (SCV) is another plug-in that manages virtual servers running on VMWare and that helps in discovering the host file system, databases on virtual machine disks (VMDK), and raw device mapping (RDM).
SnapCenter Features
SnapCenter enables you to create application-consistent Snapshot copies and to complete data protection operations, including Snapshot copy-based backup, clone, restore, and backup verification operations. SnapCenter provides a centralized management environment, while using role-based access control (RBAC) to delegate data protection and management capabilities to individual application users across the SnapCenter Server and Windows hosts.
SnapCenter includes the following key features:
Â·         A unified and scalable platform across applications and database environments and virtual and nonvirtual storage, powered by the SnapCenter Server
Â·         Consistency of features and procedures across plug-ins and environments, supported by the SnapCenter user interface
Â·         RBAC for security and centralized role delegation
Â·         Application-consistent Snapshot copy management, restore, clone, and backup verification support from both primary and secondary destinations (NetApp SnapMirror and SnapVault)
Â·         Remote package installation from the SnapCenter GUI
Â·         Nondisruptive, remote upgrades
Â·         A dedicated SnapCenter repository for faster data retrieval
Â·         Load balancing implemented by using Microsoft Windows network load balancing (NLB) and application request routing (ARR), with support for horizontal scaling
Â·         Centralized scheduling and policy management to support backup and clone operations
Â·         Centralized reporting, monitoring, and dashboard views
Â·         SnapCenter 4.1 support for data protection for VMware virtual machines, SQL Server Databases, Oracle Databases, MySQL, SAP HANA, MongoDB, and Microsoft Exchange
Â·         SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware in vCenter integration into the vSphere Web Client.  All virtual machine backup and restore tasks are preformed through the web client GUI
Â·         Using the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware in vCenter you can:
-        Create policies, resource groups and backup schedules for virtual machines
-        Backup virtual machines, VMDKs, and datastores
-        Restore virtual machines, VMDKs, and files and folders (on Windows guest OS)
-        Attach and detach VMDK
-        Monitor and report data protection operations on virtual machines and datastores
-        Support RBAC security and centralized role delegation 
-        Support guest file or folder (single or multiple) support for Windows guest OS
-        Restore an efficient storage base from primary and secondary Snapshot copies through Single File SnapRestore
-        Generate dashboard and reports that provide visibility into protected versus unprotected virtual machines and status of backup, restore, and mount jobs
-        Attach or detach virtual disks from secondary Snapshot copies
-        Attach virtual disks to an alternate virtual machine
VMware vSphere 6.7
VMWare vSphere 6.7 is the industry leading virtualization platform. VMware ESXi 6.7 is used to deploy and run the virtual machines. VCenter Server Appliance 6.7 is used to manage the ESXi hosts and virtual machines. Multiple ESXi hosts running on Cisco UCS B200 M5 blades are used form a VMware ESXi cluster. VMware ESXi cluster pool the compute, memory and network resources from all the cluster nodes and provides resilient platform for virtual machines running on the cluster. VMware ESXi cluster features, vSphere high availability and Distributed Resources Scheduler (DRS), contribute to the tolerance of the vSphere Cluster withstanding failures as well as distributing the resources across the VMWare ESXi hosts.
Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Hyper-V
Hyper-V is another leading virtualization platform offering from Microsoft. Hyper-V role is enabled on the Windows Server 2016 hosts to facilitate the virtual machine deployment. Multiple Windows Server 2016 hosts running on Cisco UCS B200 M5 blades are used to form Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC). WSFC along with Performance and Resource Management (PRO), Windows Hyper-V cluster provides high availability and resilient cluster platform for virtual machines to critical applications.
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is a widely adapted Linux server operating system. In this solution, RHEL 7,4 is used as guest operating system inside the virtual machines deployed on VMware ESXi Cluster and Windows Hyper-V Cluster. Using Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, high availability can be deployed in a variety of configurations to suit varying needs for performance, high-availability, load balancing, and file sharing. RHEL uses pacemaker, a leading high availability cluster resource manager, to mage and recover cluster resources.
Microsoft SQL Server 2017
Microsoft SQL Server 2017 is the recent relational database engine from Microsoft. It brings in lot of new features and enhancements to the relational and analytical engines. With SQL Server 2017, Microsoft embraces Linux operating systems and announces to support SQL Server on Linux. SQL server 2017 is the first stable version that performs as good as it does in Windows. Currently most of the database features that are supported in Windows are also supported in Linux. This enablement on Linux removes windows lock-in and provides flexibility to the customers to choose and deploy SQL Server databases on widely used Linux flavored operating systems.
Solution Design
FlexPod is a defined set of hardware and software that serves as an integrated foundation for both virtualized and non-virtualized solutions. VMware vSphere built on FlexPod includes NetApp All Flash FAS storage, Cisco Nexus networking, Cisco Unified Computing System, and VMware vSphere software in a single package. The design is flexible enough that the networking, computing, and storage can fit in one datacenter rack or be deployed according to a customer's data center design. Port density enables the networking components to accommodate multiple configurations of this kind.
One benefit of the FlexPod architecture is the ability to customize or "flex" the environment to suit a customer's requirements. A FlexPod can easily be scaled as requirements and demand change. The unit can be scaled both up (adding resources to a FlexPod unit) and out (adding more FlexPod units). The reference architecture detailed in this document highlights the resiliency, cost benefit, and ease of deployment of an IP-based storage solution. A storage system capable of serving multiple protocols across a single interface allows for customer choice and investment protection because it truly is a wire-once architecture.
Figure 7 shows FlexPod components and the network connections for a configuration with the Cisco UCS 6332-16UP Fabric Interconnects. This design has end-to-end 40 Gb Ethernet connections between the Cisco UCS 5108 Blade Chassis and the Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect, between the Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect and Cisco Nexus 9000, and between Cisco Nexus 9000 and NetApp AFF A300. This infrastructure is deployed to provide iSCSI-booted hosts with file-level and block-level access to shared storage. The reference architecture reinforces the "wire-once" strategy, because as additional storage is added to the architecture, no re-cabling is required from the hosts to the Cisco UCS fabric interconnect.
Figure 7  FlexPod With Cisco UCS 6332-16UP Fabric Interconnects
  Figure 7 illustrates a base design. Each of the components can be scaled easily to support specific business requirements. For example, more (or different) servers or even blade chassis can be deployed to increase compute capacity, additional storage controllers or disk shelves can be deployed to improve I/O capability and throughput, and special hardware or software features can be added to introduce new features.
The following components are used to the validate and test the solution:
Â·         1x Cisco 5108 chassis with Cisco UCS 2304 IO Modules
Â·         5x B200 M5 Blades with VIC 1340 and a Port Expander card
Â·         Two Cisco Nexus 93180YC-EX switches
Â·         Two Cisco UCS 6332-16UP fabric interconnects
Â·         One NetApp AFF A300 (HA pair) running clustered Data ONTAP with Disk shelves and Solid-State Drives (SSD)
In this solution, both VMware ESXi and Windows Hyper-V virtual environments are tested and validated for deploying SQL Server 2017 on virtual machine running Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system.
Figure 8 illustrates the high-level steps to deploy SQL Server on a RHEL virtual machine in a FlexPod environment with both VMware and Hyper-V hypervisors.

  Configuration Guidelines
This document provides the details to configure a fully redundant, highly available configuration for a FlexPod unit with clustered Data ONTAP storage. Therefore, reference is made to which component is being configured with each step, either 01 or 02 or A and B. For example, node01 and node02 are used to identify the two NetApp storage controllers that are provisioned with this document, and Cisco Nexus A or Cisco Nexus B identifies the pair of Cisco Nexus switches that are configured. The Cisco UCS fabric interconnects are similarly configured. Additionally, this document details the steps for provisioning multiple Cisco UCS hosts, and these examples are identified as: VM-Host-01, VM-Host-02 to represent infrastructure hosts deployed to each of the fabric interconnects in this document. Finally, to indicate that you should include information pertinent to your environment in a given step, <text> appears as part of the command structure. See the following example for the network port vlan create command:

FlexPod Cabling
The information in this section is provided as a reference for cabling the physical equipment in a FlexPod environment. To simplify cabling requirements, the tables include both local and remote device and port locations.
The tables in this section contain details for the prescribed and supported configuration of the NetApp AFF A300 running NetApp ONTAP 9.5.
          For any modifications of this prescribed architecture, consult the NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool (IMT)
This document assumes that out-of-band management ports are plugged into an existing management infrastructure at the deployment site. These interfaces will be used in various configuration steps.
            Be sure to use the cabling directions in this section as a guide.
The NetApp storage controller and disk shelves should be connected according to best practices for the specific storage controller and disk shelves. For disk shelf cabling, refer to the Universal SAS and ACP Cabling Guide: https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_get_file/ECMM1280392
The following details the cable connections used in the validation lab for the 40Gb end-to-end iSCSI topology based on the Cisco UCS 6332-16UP fabric interconnect.  Additional 1Gb management connections will be needed for an out-of-band network switch that sits apart from the FlexPod infrastructure.  Each Cisco UCS fabric interconnect and Cisco Nexus switch is connected to the out-of-band network switch, and each AFF controller has two connections to the out-of-band network switch.

          The node management interface can be on the same subnet as the cluster management interface, or it can be on a different subnet. In this document, we assume that it is on the same subnet.
Log into the Cluster
To log in to the cluster, follow these steps:
1.        Open an SSH connection to either the cluster IP or host name.
2.       Log in to the admin user with the password you provided earlier.
Zero All Spare Disks
To zero all spare disks in the cluster, run the following command:
disk zerospares
       Advanced Data Partitioning creates a root partition and two data partitions on each SSD drive in an AFF configuration. Disk autoassign should have assigned one data partition to each node in an HA pair. If a different disk assignment is required, disk autoassignment must be disabled on both nodes in the HA pair by running the disk option modify command. Spare partitions can then be moved from one node to another by running the disk removeowner and disk assign commands.
Set Onboard Unified Target Adapter 2 Port Personality
To set the personality of the onboard unified target adapter 2 (UTA2), follow these steps:
1.        Verify the Current Mode and Current Type properties of the ports by running the ucadmin show command:
ucadmin show
                       Current  Current    Pending  Pending    Admin
Node          Adapter  Mode     Type       Mode     Type       Status

              0h       cna      target     -        -          online
8 entries were displayed.
2.       Verify that the Current Mode and Current Type properties for all ports are set properly. Set the ports used for iSCSI connectivity to mode cna. The port type for all protocols should be set to target. Change the port personality by running the following command:
ucadmin modify -node <home-node-of-the-port> -adapter <port-name> -mode {fc|cna} -type target
          The ports must be offline to run this command. To take an adapter offline, run the fcp adapter modify ânode <home-node-of-the-port> -adapter <port-name> -state down command. Ports must be converted in pairs (for example, 0e and 0f). After conversion, a reboot is required, and the ports must be brought back to the up state.
Set Auto-Revert on Cluster Management
To set the auto-revert parameter on the cluster management interface, follow this step:
       An SVM is referred to as a Vserver (or vserver) in the GUI and CLI.
Run the following command:
network interface modify âvserver <clustername> -lif cluster_mgmt âauto-revert true
Set Up Management Broadcast Domain
By default, all network ports are included in the default broadcast domain. Network ports used for data services (for example, e0d, e2a, and e2e) should be removed from the default broadcast domain, leaving just the management network ports (e0c and e0M). To perform this task, run the following commands:
broadcast-domain remove-ports âbroadcast-domain Default âports <st-node01>:e0d,<st-node01>:e0e,<st-node01>:e0f,<st-node01>:e0g,<st-node01>:e0h,<st-node01>:e2a, <st-node01>:e2e,<st-node02>:e0d,<st-node02>:e0e,<st-node02>:e0f,<st-node02>:e0g,<st-node02>:e0h <st-node02>:e2a,<st-node02>:e2e
broadcast-domain show
Set Up Service Processor Network Interface
To assign a static IPv4 address to the service processor on each node, run the following commands:
system service-processor network modify ânode <st-node01> -address-family IPv4 âenable true âdhcp none âip-address <node01-sp-ip> -netmask <node01-sp-mask> -gateway <node01-sp-gateway>
  system service-processor network modify ânode <st-node02> -address-family IPv4 âenable true âdhcp none âip-address <node02-sp-ip> -netmask <node02-sp-mask> -gateway <node02-sp-gateway>
       The service processor IP addresses should be in the same subnet as the node management IP addresses.
Create Aggregates
An aggregate containing the root volume is created during the ONTAP setup process. To create additional aggregates, determine the aggregate name, the node on which to create it, and the number of disks it should contain.
To create new aggregates, follow these steps:
1.        Run the following commands:
aggr create -aggregate aggr1_node01 -node <st-node01> -diskcount <num-disks>
aggr create -aggregate aggr1_node02 -node <st-node02> -diskcount <num-disks>
          You should have the minimum number of hot spare disks for hot spare disk partitions recommended for your aggregate.
            For all flash aggregates, you should have a minimum of one hot spare disk or disk partition. For non-flash homogenous aggregates, you should have a minimum of two hot spare disks or disk partitions. For Flash Pool aggregates, you should have a minimum of two hot spare disks or disk partitions for each disk type.
            Start with five disks initially; you can add disks to an aggregate when additional storage is required. In an AFF configuration with a small number of SSDs, you might want to create an aggregate with all but one remaining disk (spare) assigned to the controller.
            The aggregate cannot be created until disk zeroing completes. Run the aggr show command to display aggregate creation status. Do not proceed until both aggr1_node1 and aggr1_node2 are online.
2.       (Optional) Rename the root aggregate on node 01 to match the naming convention for this aggregate on node 02. The aggregate will be automatically renamed if System guided setup is used.
aggr show
aggr rename âaggregate aggr0 ânewname <node01-rootaggrname>
Verify Storage Failover
To confirm that storage failover is enabled, run the following commands for a failover pair:
1.        Verify the status of the storage failover.
storage failover show
          Both <st-node01> and <st-node02> must be capable of performing a takeover. Continue with step 3 if the nodes are capable of performing a takeover.
2.       Enable failover on one of the two nodes.
storage failover modify -node <st-node01> -enabled true
          Enabling failover on one node enables it for both nodes.
3.        Verify the HA status for a two-node cluster.
          This step is not applicable for clusters with more than two nodes.
cluster ha show
4.       Continue with step 6 if high availability is configured.
5.        Only enable HA mode for two-node clusters. Do not run this command for clusters with more than two nodes because it causes problems with failover.
cluster ha modify -configured true
Do you want to continue? {y|n}: y
6.       Verify that hardware assist is correctly configured and, if needed, modify the partner IP address.
storage failover hwassist show
storage failover modify âhwassist-partner-ip <node02-mgmt-ip> -node <st-node01>
storage failover modify âhwassist-partner-ip <node01-mgmt-ip> -node <st-node02>
Disable Flow Control on 10GbE and 40GbE Ports
NetApp recommends disabling flow control on all the 10GbE and UTA2 ports that are connected to external devices. To disable flow control, follow these steps:
1.        Run the following commands to configure node 01:
network port modify -node <st-node01> -port e0a,e0b,e0e,e0f,e0g,e0h,e2a,e2e -flowcontrol-admin none
Warning: Changing the network port settings will cause a several second interruption in carrier.
Do you want to continue? {y|n}: y
2.       Run the following commands to configure node 02:
network port modify -node <st-node02> -port e0a,e0b,e0e,e0f,e0g,e0h,e2a,e2e -flowcontrol-admin none
Warning: Changing the network port settings will cause a several second interruption in carrier.
Do you want to continue? {y|n}: y
network port show âfields flowcontrol-admin
Disable Unused FCoE Capability on CNA Ports
If the UTA2 port is set to CNA mode and is only expected to handle Ethernet data traffic (for example NFS), then the unused FCoE capability of the port should be disabled by setting the corresponding FCP adapter to state down with the fcp adapter modify command. Here are some examples:
fcp adapter modify -node <st-node01> -adapter 0e âstatus-admin down
fcp adapter modify -node <st-node01> -adapter 0f âstatus-admin down
fcp adapter modify -node <st-node01> -adapter 0g âstatus-admin down
fcp adapter modify -node <st-node01> -adapter 0h âstatus-admin down
fcp adapter modify -node <st-node02> -adapter 0e âstatus-admin down
fcp adapter modify -node <st-node02> -adapter 0f âstatus-admin down
fcp adapter modify -node <st-node02> -adapter 0g âstatus-admin down
fcp adapter modify -node <st-node02> -adapter 0h âstatus-admin down
fcp adapter show âfields âstatus-admin
Configure Network Time Protocol
To configure time synchronization on the cluster, follow these steps:
1.        Set the time zone for the cluster.
timezone <timezone>
          For example, in the eastern United States, the time zone is America/New_York.
2.       Set the date for the cluster.
date <ccyymmddhhmm.ss>
          The format for the date is <[Century][Year][Month][Day][Hour][Minute].[Second]> (for example, 201309081735.17).
3.        Configure the NTP servers for the cluster.
cluster time-service ntp server create -server <switch-a-ntp-ip>
cluster time-service ntp server create -server <switch-b-ntp-ip>
Configure Simple Network Management Protocol
To configure the SNMP, follow these steps:
1.        Configure basic SNMP information, such as the location and contact. When polled, this information is visible as the sysLocation and sysContact variables in SNMP.
snmp contact <snmp-contact>
snmp location â<snmp-location>â
snmp init 1
options snmp.enable on
2.       Configure SNMP traps to send to remote hosts, such as a DFM server or another fault management system.
snmp traphost add <oncommand-um-server-fqdn>
Configure SNMPv1 Access
To configure SNMPv1 access, set the shared, secret plain-text password (called a community).
snmp community add ro <snmp-community>
Configure AutoSupport
NetApp AutoSupport sends support summary information to NetApp through HTTPS. To configure AutoSupport, run the following command:
system node autosupport modify -node * -state enable âmail-hosts <mailhost> -transport https -support enable -noteto <storage-admin-email>
Enable Cisco Discovery Protocol
To enable the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) on the NetApp storage controllers, run the following command to enable CDP on ONTAP:
node run -node * options cdpd.enable on
       To be effective, CDP must also be enabled on directly connected networking equipment such as switches and routers.
Create Jumbo Frame MTU Broadcast Domains in Clustered Data ONTAP
To create a data broadcast domain with an MTU of 9000, run the following commands to create a broadcast domain for NFS and iSCSI on ONTAP:
broadcast-domain create -broadcast-domain Infra_NFS -mtu 9000
broadcast-domain create -broadcast-domain Infra_iSCSI-A -mtu 9000
broadcast-domain create -broadcast-domain Infra_iSCSI-B -mtu 9000
Create Interface Groups
To create the LACP interface groups for the 10GbE data interfaces, run the following commands:
ifgrp create -node <st-node01> -ifgrp a0a -distr-func port -mode multimode_lacp
ifgrp add-port -node <st-node01> -ifgrp a0a -port e2a
ifgrp add-port -node <st-node01> -ifgrp a0a -port e2e

ifgrp create -node <st-node02> -ifgrp a0a -distr-func port -mode multimode_lacp
ifgrp add-port -node <st-node02> -ifgrp a0a -port e2a
ifgrp add-port -node <st-node02> -ifgrp a0a -port e2e
  ifgrp show
Create VLANs
To create VLANs, create NFS VLAN ports and add them to the NFS broadcast domain:
network port modify ânode <st-node01> -port a0a âmtu 9000
network port modify ânode <st-node02> -port a0a âmtu 9000
network port vlan create ânode <st-node01> -vlan-name a0a-<infra-nfs-vlan-id>

Infrastructure Storage Virtual Machine (Optional)
          Create a separate SVM for hosting infrastructure services (virtual machines) on dedicated UCS servers. If you are planning to combine infrastructure service virtual machines along with workload virtual machines, this step can be skipped.
Create Storage Virtual Machine
To create an infrastructure SVM, follow these steps:
1.        Run the vserver create command.
vserver create âvserver Infra-SVM ârootvolume rootvol âaggregate aggr1_node01 ârootvolume-security-style unix
2.       Select the SVM data protocols to configure, keeping iSCSI and NFS.
vserver remove-protocols âvserver Infra-SVM -protocols fcp,cifs,ndmp
3.        Add the two data aggregates to the Infra-SVM aggregate list for the NetApp VSC.
vserver modify âvserver Infra-SVM âaggr-list aggr1_node01,aggr1_node02
4.       Enable and run the NFS protocol in the Infra-SVM.
nfs create -vserver Infra-SVM -udp disabled
5.        Turn on the SVM vStorage parameter for the NetApp NFS vStorage APIs â Array integration VAAI plug-in.
vserver nfs modify âvserver Infra-SVM âvstorage enabled
vserver nfs show
Create Load-Sharing Mirrors of SVM Root Volume
To create a load-sharing mirror of an SVM root volume, follow these steps:
1.        Create a volume to be the load-sharing mirror of the infrastructure SVM root volume on each node.
volume create âvserver Infra-SVM âvolume rootvol_m01 âaggregate aggr1_node01 âsize 1GB âtype DP
volume create âvserver Infra-SVM âvolume rootvol_m02 âaggregate aggr1_node02 âsize 1GB âtype DP
2.       Create a job schedule to update the root volume mirror relationships every 15 minutes.
job schedule interval create -name 15min -minutes 15
3.        Create the mirroring relationships.
snapmirror create âsource-path Infra-SVM:rootvol âdestination-path Infra-SVM:rootvol_m01 âtype LS -schedule 15min
snapmirror create âsource-path Infra-SVM:rootvol âdestination-path Infra-SVM:rootvol_m02 âtype LS -schedule 15min
4.       Initialize the mirroring relationship.
snapmirror initialize-ls-set âsource-path Infra-SVM:rootvol
snapmirror show
Create Block Protocol (iSCSI) Service
Run the following command to create the iSCSI service on each SVM. This command also starts the iSCSI service and sets the iSCSI Qualified Name (IQN) for the SVM.
iscsi create -vserver Infra-SVM
iscsi show
Configure HTTPS Access
To configure secure access to the storage controller, follow these steps:
1.        Increase the privilege level to access the certificate commands.
set -privilege diag
Do you want to continue? {y|n}: y
2.       Generally, a self-signed certificate is already in place. Verify the certificate and obtain parameters (for example, <serial-number>) by running the following command:
security certificate show
3.        For each SVM shown, the certificate common name should match the DNS FQDN of the SVM. Delete the two default certificates and replace them with either self-signed certificates or certificates from a certificate authority (CA). To delete the default certificates, run the following commands:
security certificate delete -vserver Infra-SVM -common-name Infra-SVM -ca Infra-SVM -type server -serial <serial-number>
          Deleting expired certificates before creating new certificates is a best practice. Run the security certificate delete command to delete the expired certificates. In the following command, use TAB completion to select and delete each default certificate.
4.       To generate and install self-signed certificates, run the following commands as one-time commands. Generate a server certificate for the Infra-SVM and the cluster SVM. Use TAB completion to aid in the completion of these commands.
security certificate create -common-name <cert-common-name> -type  server -size 2048 -country <cert-country> -state <cert-state> -locality <cert-locality> -organization <cert-org> -unit <cert-unit> -email-addr <cert-email> -expire-days <cert-days> -protocol SSL -hash-function SHA256 -vserver Infra-SVM
5.        To obtain the values for the parameters required in step 5 (<cert-ca> and <cert-serial>), run the security certificate show command.
6.       Enable each certificate that was just created by using the âserver-enabled true and âclient-enabled false parameters. Use TAB completion to aid in the completion of these commands.
security ssl modify -vserver <clustername> -server-enabled true -client-enabled false -ca <cert-ca> -serial <cert-serial> -common-name <cert-common-name>
7.        Disable HTTP cluster management access.
system services firewall policy delete -policy mgmt -service http âvserver <clustername>
          It is normal for some of these commands to return an error message stating that the entry does not exist.
8.       Change back to the normal admin privilege level and set up the system to allow SVM logs to be available by web.
set âprivilege admin
vserver services web modify âname spi|ontapi|compat âvserver * -enabled true
Configure NFSv3
To configure NFSv3 on the SVM, follow these steps:
1.        Create a new rule for the infrastructure NFS subnet in the default export policy.
vserver export-policy rule create âvserver Infra-SVM -policyname default âruleindex 1 âprotocol nfs -clientmatch <infra-nfs-subnet-cidr> -rorule sys ârwrule sys -superuser sys âallow-suid false
2.       Assign the FlexPod export policy to the infrastructure SVM root volume.
volume modify âvserver Infra-SVM âvolume rootvol âpolicy default
Create FlexVol Volumes
The following information is required to create a NetApp FlexVol volume:
Â·         The volume name
Â·         The volume size
Â·         The aggregate on which the volume exists
To create a FlexVol volume, run the following commands:
volume create -vserver Infra-SVM -volume infra_datastore_1 -aggregate aggr1_node01 -size 500GB -state online -policy default -junction-path /infra_datastore_1 -space-guarantee none -percent-snapshot-space 0
  volume create -vserver Infra-SVM -volume infra_datastore_2 -aggregate aggr1_node02 -size 500GB -state online -policy default -junction-path /infra_datastore_2 -space-guarantee none -percent-snapshot-space 0
volume create -vserver Infra-SVM -volume esxi_boot -aggregate aggr1_node01 -size 100GB -state online -policy default -space-guarantee none -percent-snapshot-space 0
  snapmirror update-ls-set -source-path Infra-SVM:rootvol
Create Boot LUNs
To create two boot LUNs, run the following commands:
lun create -vserver Infra-SVM -volume esxi_boot -lun VM-Host-Infra-01 -size 15GB -ostype vmware -space-reserve disabled
lun create -vserver Infra-SVM -volume esxi_boot -lun VM-Host-Infra-02 -size 15GB -ostype vmware -space-reserve disabled
Schedule Deduplication
On NetApp AFF systems, deduplication is enabled by default. To schedule deduplication, follow these steps:
1.        After the volumes are created, assign a once-a-day deduplication schedule to esxi_boot and infra_datastore_1:
efficiency modify âvserver Infra-SVM âvolume esxi_boot âschedule sun-sat@0
efficiency modify âvserver Infra-SVM âvolume infra_datastore_1 âschedule sun-sat@0
Create Management LIF

  network interface show
Add Infrastructure SVM Administrator
To add the infrastructure SVM administrator and SVM administration LIF in the out-of-band management network, follow these steps:
1.        Run the following commands:
network interface create âvserver Infra-SVM âlif svm-mgmt ârole data âdata-protocol none âhome-node <st-node02> -home-port e0c âaddress <svm-mgmt-ip> -netmask <svm-mgmt-mask> -status-admin up âfailover-policy broadcast-domain-wide âfirewall-policy mgmt âauto-revert true

          The SVM management IP in this step should be in the same subnet as the storage cluster management IP.
2.       Create a default route to allow the SVM management interface to reach the outside world.
network route create âvserver Infra-SVM -destination 0.0.0.0/0 âgateway <svm-mgmt-gateway>
  network route show
3.        Set a password for the SVM vsadmin user and unlock the user.
security login password âusername vsadmin âvserver Infra-SVM
Enter a new password:  <password>
Enter it again:  <password>

security login unlock âusername vsadmin âvserver Infra-SVM
          A cluster serves data through at least one and possibly several SVMs. We have just gone through creating a single SVM. If you would like to configure your environment with multiple SVMs, this is a good time to create additional SVMs.
Gather Necessary Information
After the Cisco UCS service profiles have been created, each infrastructure server in the environment will have a unique configuration. To proceed with the FlexPod deployment, specific information must be gathered from each Cisco UCS server and from the NetApp controllers. Insert the required information into following tables.
Table 6         iSCSI IQN and iSCSI LIFs
IQN or LIF IP

Create Block Protocol (iSCSI) Service
Run the following command to create the iSCSI service on each SVM. This command also starts the iSCSI service and sets the IQN for the SVM.
iscsi create -vserver ESXi-Work-SVM
iscsi show
Configure HTTPS Access
To configure secure access to the storage controller, follow these steps:
1.        Increase the privilege level to access the certificate commands.
set -privilege diag
Do you want to continue? {y|n}: y
2.       Generally, a self-signed certificate is already in place. Verify the certificate and obtain parameters (for example, <serial-number>) by running the following command:
security certificate show
3.        For each SVM shown, the certificate common name should match the DNS FQDN of the SVM. Delete the two default certificates and replace them with either self-signed certificates or certificates from a certificate authority (CA). To delete the default certificates, run the following commands:
security certificate delete -vserver ESXi-Work-SVM -common-name ESXi-Work-SVM -ca ESXi-Work-SVM -type server -serial <serial-number>
          Deleting expired certificates before creating new certificates is a best practice. Run the security certificate delete command to delete the expired certificates. In the following command, use TAB completion to select and delete each default certificate.
4.       To generate and install self-signed certificates, run the following commands as one-time commands. Generate a server certificate for the ESXi-Work-SVM and the cluster SVM. Use TAB completion to aid in the completion of these commands.
security certificate create -common-name <cert-common-name> -type  server -size 2048 -country <cert-country> -state <cert-state> -locality <cert-locality> -organization <cert-org> -unit <cert-unit> -email-addr <cert-email> -expire-days <cert-days> -protocol SSL -hash-function SHA256 -vserver ESXi-Work-SVM
5.        To obtain the values for the parameters required in step 5 (<cert-ca> and <cert-serial>), run the security certificate show command.
6.       Enable each certificate that was just created by using the âserver-enabled true and âclient-enabled false parameters. Use TAB completion to aid in the completion of these commands.
security ssl modify -vserver <clustername> -server-enabled true -client-enabled false -ca <cert-ca> -serial <cert-serial> -common-name <cert-common-name>
7.        Disable HTTP cluster management access.
system services firewall policy delete -policy mgmt -service http âvserver <clustername>
          It is normal for some of these commands to return an error message stating that the entry does not exist.
8.       Change back to the normal admin privilege level and set up the system to allow SVM logs to be available by web.
set âprivilege admin
vserver services web modify âname spi|ontapi|compat âvserver * -enabled true

FlexPod VMware vSphere Distributed Switch (vDS)
This section provides the procedures for installing the VMware vDS on the FlexPod ESXi Management Hosts.
In the Cisco UCS setup section of this document two sets of vNICs (Host-A and B, and iSCSI-A and B) were setup. The vmnic ports associated with the Host-A and B vNICs will be migrated to VMware vDS in this procedure. The critical infrastructure VLAN interfaces and vMotion interfaces will be configured on the vDS.
An IB-Mgmt VLAN and a SQL-VM-Traffic VLAN port group will be added to the vDS. Any additional VLAN-based port groups added to the vDS would need to have the corresponding VLANs added to the Cisco UCS LAN cloud, to the Cisco UCS Host-A and B vNIC templates, and to the Cisco Nexus 9K switches and vPC and peer-link interfaces on the switches.

SQL Server 2017 on RHEL Installation and Configuration
This section explains how to install and configure SQL Server 2017 on RHEL virtual machine. For more information, go to: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-red-hat?view=sql-server-2017
SQL Server 2017 Installation
To install SQL Server 2017 on the RHEL virtual machine, follow these steps:
1.        Log into virtual machine as root user.
2.       Install Microsoft SQL Server repo files required for installing SQL Server 2017.
curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/mssql-server.repo https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/7/mssql-server-2017.repo
3.        Execute the following command to install SQL Server 2017.
yum install -y mssql-server
4.       After installation completes, run mssql-conf to select required edition and set the password for SA login. For this documentation, Evaluation Edition (1) is chosen.
/opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf setup
5.        When setup is complete, enable SQL Server service and verify that SQL service is running by running the following commands.
systemctl enable mssql-server
systemctl status mssql-server
6.       Allow the remote connections to SQL Server instance by opening SQL Server ports on the firewall. Execute the following commands to open SQL Server default port 1433 permanently.
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=1433/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd âreload
7.        Install SQL Server command-line tools by running the following commands.
sudo curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/msprod.repo https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/7/prod.repo
yum install -y mssql-tools unixODBC-devel
8.       Set the path to SQL Server sqlcmd tool so that you do not have to specify the full path when using sqlcmd tool.
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools/bin"' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
9.       Verify that you are able to connect to SQL Server locally using sqlcmd tool.
sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P <sa login Password>
Change Memory Settings
To make there is enough free physical memory for the Linux Operating System, the SQL Server process uses only 80 percent of the physical RAM by default. However, the default behavior may not be appropriate for all the systems. It is recommended to manually configure the memory for SQL Server using mssql-conf tool. When changing this setting, make sure there is enough memory for Linux OS and other applications running on the same virtual machine. Figure 163 shows setting 12G memory for the SQL Server on a virtual machine configured with 16G memory.
Figure 163        Setting Memory for SQL Server
Change the Default Directories for Databases
By default, SQL Server stores the database files in the default location (/var/opt/mssql/data/) until unless location of the database files is mentioned. It is a best practice to change the default database files location to point to the multipath devices that were previously created. To change the default database files location to the newly mounted multipath device, follow these steps:
1.        Change the owner and group of the directories (mountpoints) where the NetApp devices are mounted.
2.       Change the default data and log directories as shown below.
Figure 164       Changing Default Data and Log Directories
Configure Tempdb Database Files
The SQL Server on Linux installation does not offer an option to configure multiple tempdb files during the installation, it is recommended to create multiple tempdb data files after the installation. Figure 165 shows eight configured data files and one log file on the multipath devices. The SQL Server Management studio can be used to configure the TempDB database.
Figure 165        Configure TempDB database files
Add SQL Server to Active Directory Domain
Active Directory authentication enables domain-joined clients on either Windows or Linux to authenticate to SQL Server using their domain credentials and the Kerberos protocol.
AD Authentication has the following advantages over SQL Server Authentication:
Â·         Users authenticate through single sign-on, without being prompted for a password.
Â·         By creating logins for AD groups, you can manage access and permissions in SQL Server using AD group memberships.
Â·         Each user has a single identity across your organization, so it eliminates tracking of SQL Server logins created against which user.
Â·         AD enables you to enforce a centralized password policy across your organization.
For detailed information to configure the SQL Server on Linux for Active Directory Authentication, go to: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-active-directory-authentication?view=sql-server-2017#createuser
Below is an example of integrated authentication in Windows VM.

SQL Server Always On Availability Group on RHEL Virtual Machines  Deployment
This section details the process to deploy SQL Server Always On Availability Groups (AG) for high availability of databases on RHEL virtual machines using pacemaker cluster technology.
SQL Server Always On Availability Groups on Linux environments leverages underlying clustering technology called pacemaker. Pacemaker is a robust and powerful open source cluster resource manager which is shipping with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 as high availability add on. For more details on pacemaker cluster, refer: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/pdf/high_availability_add-on_reference/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux-7-High_Availability_Add-On_Reference-en-US.pdf
For achieving high availability with automatic failover of SQL Server databases using Always On Availability Groups on RHEL requires minimum of three RHEL hosts. The following sections provides steps for deploying SQL Server Always On Availability Groups on three RHEL virtual machines.
Install and Configure Pacemaker Cluster on RHEL Virtual Machines
To deploy and configure the pacemaker cluster, follow these steps:
1.        Log into the RHEL hosts (SQLVM01, SQLVM02 and SQLVM03) using root user.
2.       Enter the fully qualified names of all the cluster participating hosts in the /etc/hosts file on all the hosts as shown below for SQLVM01. This helps to resolve the IP addresses locally.
          This step is not required if all the RHEL hosts are registered with their IP addresses in the DNS server.
Figure 167        Updating Fully Qualified Names
          The cluster participating hosts do not need to be part of Active Directory. Pacemaker also works with RHEL hosts which are not part of any domain
3.        The pacemaker cluster comes as an add-on package with the RHEL 7.4 ISO installation media. To mount and configure the yum repository list using local media, run the following steps:
          Before running the following commands, make sure RHEL 7.4 DVD is added to the virtual machines. Run the following step on all RHEL hosts.
mount -o loop /dev/sr0  /mnt
cp /mnt/media.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/rhel7dvd.repo
chmod 644 /etc/yum.repos.d/rhel7dvd.repo
4.       Edit the /etc/yum.repos.d/rhel7dvd.repo file with the information shown below and save the file. Run the following step on all RHEL hosts.
Figure 168       Configuring rheldvd.repo File
5.        Install the required packages by running the following command. Run the following commands on all RHEL hosts.
yum install pacemaker pcs fence-agents-all resource-agents
6.       Enable and start the pacemaker and pcsd services on all hosts. Run the following commands on all RHEL hosts.
systemctl start pcsd.service
systemctl enable pcsd.service
systemctl start pacemaker
systemctl enable pacemaker
7.        Open the firewall ports for pacemaker cluster communication. Run the following commands on all RHEL hosts.
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=high-availability
firewall-cmd --add-service=high-availability
firewall-cmd âreload
8.       Set the password for the default user that is created when installing Pacemaker and Corosync packages. Use the same password on all nodes.
passwd hacluster
9.       Authenticate all the hosts from each host as shown below from the SQLVM01 host.
Figure 169       Authentication of Hosts
10.    Create the pacemaker cluster by running the following command on a single RHEL host:
pcs cluster setup --name sqlavg-clus SQLVM01.aflexpod.cisco.com SQLVM02.aflexpod.cisco.com SQLVM03.aflexpod.cisco.com
11.     Start the pacemaker cluster services (pacemaker, pcs, corosyn, and so on.) and enable them on all hosts by running the following command on a single node.
pcs cluster start --all
pcs cluster enable âall
12.    The following commands provide various cluster level information and configuration details.
pcs status
pcs status corosync
corosync-cmapctl | grep members
corosyn-cfgtool -s
13.     Validate cluster configuration by running the following command. Cluster configuration errors, If any, are reported by this command.
crm_verify -L -V
          You may notice some warnings related to the cluster fencing configuration. By default, the pacemaker cluster requires STONITH (Shoot The Other Node In The Head) or fencing device to be configured for the cluster setup. Fencing is the process of isolating and preventing a misbehaving node from affecting the availability of the cluster. Pacemaker supports variety of fencing devices and plugins. For more information about configuring the fencing devices on VMware environment, go to https://access.redhat.com/solutions/917813. STONITH configuration is not supported in Hyper-V deployments.
14.    Disable STONITH as shown below. Notice that after disabling STONITH, the warning messages disappear.
Figure 170        Disabling STONITH
15.     Set the cluster property cluster-recheck-interval to 2 minutes to reduce the time interval in which the cluster tries to attempt to restart a failed resource.
pcs property set cluster-recheck-interval=2min
16.    Set the cluster property start-failure-is-fatal to true to avoid the cluster from restarting a failed resource on the same cluster node.
pcs property set start-failure-is-fatal=true
17.     Pacemaker cluster can be monitored live using the following command.
crm_mon
Figure 171        Monitoring Cluster
18.    Pacemaker cluster can also be created and managed by the User Interface (UI). To create or manage an existing cluster, enter the user IP address of any RHEL host along with port 2224 as shown below. Use the hacluster IP URL to log into the cluster. In this case, http://192.168.94.53:2222/login.
Figure 172        Create or Manage Pacemaker Cluster Using UI
The figure below shows the details of an existing cluster.
Figure 173        Managing Cluster Using Pacemaker UI
Install and Configure Always On Availability Group on Pacemaker Cluster
To install and configure Always On Availability Groups (AG) and how to add and manage AG resource in the pacemaker cluster, follow these steps:
1.        Enable SQL Server Always On Availability Group and restart SQL service on all RHEL hosts by running the following command.
 /opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf set hadr.hadrenabled  1
systemctl restart mssql-service
2.       Install Linux cluster resource agent for SQL Server Always On Availability Group by running the following command on all the rhel hosts. After the installation complete, you will notice resource provider for AG is listed
yum install mssql-server-ha -y
pcs resource providers
3.        Enable AlwaysOn_health event session of SQL Server instance on all the rhel hosts. Use SQL Management studio and run the following command on each SQL instance.
ALTER EVENT SESSION AlwaysOn_health ON SERVER WITH (STARTUP_STATE=ON)
4.       SQL Server service on Linux uses certificates to authenticate communication between the mirroring endpoints. The following Transact-SQL script creates a master key and a certificate. It then backs up the certificate and secures the file with a private key. Update the script with strong passwords. Connect to the primary SQL Server instance (in this case, SQLVM01) and run the following script to create the certificate.
CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'YourMasterKeyPwd!';
CREATE CERTIFICATE dbm_certificate WITH SUBJECT = 'dbm';
BACKUP CERTIFICATE dbm_certificate
   TO FILE = '/var/opt/mssql/data/dbm_certificate.cer'
   WITH PRIVATE KEY (
           FILE = '/var/opt/mssql/data/dbm_certificate.pvk',
           ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'YourPrivateKeyPwd!'
       );
5.        The script (above) creates two files; dbm_certificate.cer and dbm_certificate.pvk in /var/opt/mssql/data/ location with mssql as their file owner as shown below.
Figure 174        Creating Certificates On Primary Replica
6.       Copy these two files to each secondary replica (SQLVM02 and SQLVM03) to the same location as shown below.
Figure 175        Copy Certificates to Secondary Replicas
7.        These files are copied from primary to secondaries using the root user; the current owner of these files is root. Change the file owner of these files to mssql on each secondary replica as shown below, for example; Changing owner on SQLVM02.
Figure 176        Changing Owner of the Files
8.       Run the following script to create certificates on each secondary replica (SQLVM02 and SQLVM03) using the files copied in step 7.
CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'YourMasterKeyPwd!';
go
CREATE CERTIFICATE dbm_certificate
   FROM FILE = '/var/opt/mssql/data/dbm_certificate.cer'
   WITH PRIVATE KEY (FILE='/var/opt/mssql/data/dbm_certificate.pvk',
   DECRYPTION BY PASSWORD='YourPrivateKeyPwd!');
go
9.       Create the database mirroring endpoints all the replicas by running the following script.
CREATE ENDPOINT [Hadr_endpoint]
    AS TCP (LISTENER_PORT = 5022)
    FOR DATABASE_MIRRORING (
        ROLE = ALL,
        AUTHENTICATION = CERTIFICATE dbm_certificate,
        ENCRYPTION = REQUIRED ALGORITHM AES
        );
ALTER ENDPOINT [Hadr_endpoint] STATE = STARTED;
10.    Open the endpoint tcp ports on the firewall by running the following script on each replica.
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=5022/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd âreload
11.     Create the Always On Availability Group by running the following script on the primary replica as shown below. Note that Cluster_Type is set to External and seeding (initial synchronization) is set to automatic. The three RHEL hosts are configured with synchronous replication with automatic failover.
Figure 177        Creating Always On Availability Group
12.    To have automatic failover of SQL resources in the pacemaker cluster, mssql-server-ha resource agent needs a login to connect the SQL instances. Create a SQL login with the appropriate permissions by running this script on each replica.
USE [master]
GO
CREATE LOGIN [pacemakerLogin] with PASSWORD= N'password'
ALTER SERVER ROLE [sysadmin] ADD MEMBER [pacemakerLogin]
13.     Save the pacemakerLongin credentials in /var/opt/mssql/secrets/ path on each replica as shown below for SQLVM01.
Figure 178        Saving PacemkaerLogin Credentials On All Replicas
14.    Join the secondary replicas to the Always On Availability Group by running the following script on them (SQLVM02 and SQLVM03).
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [LINUX_SQLAG1] JOIN WITH (CLUSTER_TYPE = EXTERNAL);
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [LINUX_SQLAG1] GRANT CREATE ANY DATABASE;
15.     Add a listener IP address to the Availability Group by running the following T-SQLscript on the primary replica.
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP LINUX_SQLAG1
ADD LISTENER N'SQLAG1_LISTNER'
(WITH IP
 ((N'192.168.94.55', N'255.255.255.0')), PORT=1433
);
GO
16.    Grant the appropriate permission to the pacemakerLogin on Availability Group in all replicas by running the following script.
GRANT ALTER, CONTROL, VIEW DEFINITION ON AVAILABILITY GROUP::LINUX_SQLAG1 TO [pacemakerLogin]
GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO [pacemakerLogin]
17.     Create a sample database with full recovery mode and back it up to meet the database requirements of the Availability Group. Execute the following T-SQLl script on the primary replica. Change the backup location as appropriate.
Figure 179        Creating Sample Database for AG
18.    Add the sample database created in the step 17 to the Always On Availability Group by running the following script on the Primary replica. Since the seeding mode is automatic, the secondary replica will be synchronized automatically by the Availability Group itself. For larger databases, it is recommended to manually synchronize the databases on the all the replicas and then join the database to the Availability Group.
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP LINUX_SQLAG1 ADD DATABASE SQLAG1_DB1;
19.    You can view the final configuration by viewing the Availability Group das board or by running the T-SQL script as shown below. Note the Listener is currently offline since the listener and Availability Group is not yet added to the pacemaker cluster as the cluster resource.
SELECT ag.name AS 'AG Name', ar.replica_server_name AS 'Replica Instance', DB_NAME(dr_state.database_id) AS 'Database', Location = CASE
WHEN ar_state.is_local = 1 THEN N'LOCAL'
ELSE 'REMOTE' END,
Role = CASE
WHEN ar_state.role_desc IS NULL THEN N'DISCONNECTED'
ELSE ar_state.role_desc  END, ar_state.connected_state_desc AS 'Connection State', ar.availability_mode_desc AS 'Mode', dr_state.synchronization_state_desc AS 'State' FROM ((sys.availability_groups AS ag JOIN sys.availability_replicas AS ar  ON ag.group_id = ar.group_id ) JOIN sys.dm_hadr_availability_replica_states AS ar_state ON ar.replica_id = ar_state.replica_id) JOIN sys.dm_hadr_database_replica_states dr_state ONag.group_id = dr_state.group_id and dr_state.replica_id = ar_state.replica_id;
GO
SELECT b.dns_name, a.ip_address, a.ip_subnet_mask, a.state_desc, b.port FROM sys.availability_group_listener_ip_addresses a INNER JOIN sys.availability_group_listeners b ON a.listener_id=b.listener_id
Figure 180       Checking Status of Availability Group
20.    Create the pacemaker cluster resource for Availability Group Linux_SQLAG1 as resource type master/slave.
pcs resource create LINUX_SQLAG ocf:mssql:ag ag_name=LINUX_SQLAG1 meta failure-timeout=30s master notify=true
21.    Run the following command to create the virtual IP address resource for the Always On Availability Group listener.
pcs resource create SQLAG1_LISTNER_VIP ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr2 ip=192.168.94.55 cidr_netmask=24
22.    Create a DNS entry for the virtual IP address created in the step (above) so that you can use the listener name to connect to Availability Group databases.
Figure 181        DNS entry for Availability Group Listener
23.    You can use the name SQLAG1_LISTNER to connect to the Availability Group databases as shown below.
Figure 182       Connecting to Availability Group Databases using Listener Name
24.    Add the co-location constraint for Availability Group and virtual IP resource to make sure that they always co-locate on the same host.
pcs constraint colocation add SQLAG1_LISTNER_VIP LINUX_SQLAG-master INFINITY with-rsc-role=Master
25.    The Order constraint needs to be added so that the cluster will always start the Availability Group resource first and then the virtual IP resource.
pcs constraint order promote LINUX_SQLAG-master then start SQLAG1_LISTNER_VIP
26.    The complete cluster status can be viewed using the pcs status command as shown below.
pcs status
Figure 183        Complete Cluster Status
Automatic Failover Testing of Availability Group
This section details the process to test the automatic failover of SQL Server Always On Availability Group configured in the previous step on a three node RHEL cluster.
When the RHEL host hosting the primary AG replica is not available for any reason, the pacemaker cluster will initiate the failover of Availability Group resources from the failed node to another node automatically.
Many failure scenarios were tested on the primary replica and verified that the Availability Group resource can failover from a failed primary replica to other nodes. For example, powering off the primary replica (as shown below âshutdown nowâ executed on SQLVM01) resulted in an automatic failover of resources to other survival nodes as shown below. During the automatic failover of resources from failed node to other survival nodes, the listener will not be available for a few seconds. This means the applications need to resubmit the failed queries.
Figure 184       Initiating Failure on Primary Replica
The following figure shows that the Availability Group resources moved to SQLVM02 replica.

Discover and Add Storage Resources
To discover the storage resources for the Monitoring and Host Configuration capability and the Provisioning and Cloning capability, follow these steps:
1.        Using the vSphere web client, log into the vCenter Server as the FlexPod admin user. If the vSphere web client was previously opened, close it and reopen it.
2.       On the Home screen, select the Home tab and click Virtual Storage Console.
3.        Select Storage Systems. Some storage systems are shown as Unknown with their IP addresses.
4.       From the Objects tab, click the IP address of an ONTAP Storage Cluster. Select Actions > Modify.
5.        In the IP Address/Hostname field, enter the storage cluster management IP address. Enter admin for the user name and the admin password for password. Confirm Use TLS to Connect to This Storage System is selected. Click OK.
6.       Click OK to accept the controller privileges.
7.        Wait for the Storage Systems to update. You might need to click Refresh to complete this update. The Storage Systems names display for the Storage Cluster and Storage Virtual Machines on the cluster for which the admin credentials are entered.
8.       Enter the user credentials for all storage clusters and refresh.
Optimal Storage Settings for ESXi Hosts
VSC allows for the automated configuration of storage-related settings for all ESXi hosts that are connected to NetApp storage controllers. To use these settings, follow these steps:
1.        From the Home screen, click vCenter > Hosts and Clusters. For each ESXi host, right-click and select NetApp VSC > Set Recommended Values for these hosts.
2.       Check the settings to apply to the selected vSphere hosts. Click OK to apply the settings.
          This functionality sets values for HBAs and converged network adapters (CNAs), sets appropriate paths and path-selection plug-ins, and verifies appropriate settings for software-based I/O (NFS and iSCSI).
3.        Click OK.
  4.       From the Home screen in the vSphere Web Client, select Virtual Storage Console.
5.        On the left under Virtual Storage Console, select NFS VAAI Tools.
6.       Make sure that NFS Plug-in for VMware VAII Version 1.1.2-3 is shown.
7.        Click Install on Host.
8.       Select both ESXi hosts and click Install.
9.       For each host for which settings were adjusted in the previous step, place the host in maintenance mode, reboot the host, and exit maintenance mode.
          In testing, a conflict was identified between NetApp VSC, vSphere 6.7U1, and UCS servers containing the LSI MegaRAID SAS Invader local disk controller.  If NetApp VSC cannot discover and set optimized settings for a server, the server most likely has the MegaRAID SAS Invader controller installed.  This controller uses the lsi-mr3 ESXi vib.  A workaround for this problem is to disable the disk controller by running esxcli system module set â-enabled=false â-module=lsi_mr3 from an ESXi console or SSH prompt and then rebooting the host. When the host comes back up, the NetApp VSC functions should then work. 
Virtual Storage Console 7.2.1 Provisioning Datastores
Using VSC, you can provision the NFS, FC or iSCSI datastore and attach it to a single host or multiple hosts in the cluster. The following sections explain how to provision a datastore and attach it to the cluster.
Provision NFS Datastore
To provision the NFS datastore, follow these steps:
1.        From the Home screen of the vSphere Web Client, right-click the FlexPod-Management cluster and select NetApp VSC > Provision Datastore.

SnapCenter 4.1.1 License Requirements
The following licenses are required for SnapCenter, on storage systems that run ONTAP 9.5. These licenses do not need to be added into the SnapCenter GUI:
Â·         Protocol licenses (NFS, FCP or iSCSI as per protocol selection for deployment)
Â·         NetApp FlexClone (for provisioning and cloning only)
Â·         NetApp SnapRestore (for backup and recovery)
Â·         The NetApp SnapManager Suite
SnapCenter Server
The SnapCenter Server includes a web server, a centralized HTML5-based user interface, PowerShell cmdlets, APIs, and the SnapCenter repository. SnapCenter enables load balancing, high availability, and horizontal scaling across multiple SnapCenter Servers within a single user interface. You can accomplish high availability by using (NLB) and Application Request Routing (ARR) with SnapCenter. For larger environments with thousands of hosts, adding multiple SnapCenterServers can help balance the load.
SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere
The Plug-in for VMware vSphere is a host-side component of the NetApp storage solution. It provides a vSphere web client GUI on vCenter to protect VMware virtual machines and datastores, and supports SnapCenter application-specific plug-ins in protecting virtualized databases and file systems.
Support for Virtualized Databases and File Systems
The Plug-in for VMware vSphere provides native backup, recovery, and cloning of virtualized applications (virtualized SQL and Oracle databases and Windows file systems) when using the SnapCenter GUI. 
SnapCenter natively leverages the Plug-in for VMware vSphere for all SQL, Oracle, and Windows file system data protection operations on virtual machine disks (VMDKs), raw device mappings (RDMs), and NFS datastores.
SnapCenter Installation
Before you install SnapCenter, the Your SnapCenter Server host system must be up-to-date with Windows updates with no pending system restarts.
1.        Download the SnapCenter Server installation package from NetApp Support site.
2.       Install the SnapCenter Server by double-clicking the downloadable .exe file to launch the SnapCenter Server installer.
3.        On the Prerequisites Validation screen, the host is validated to see if it meets the requirements to install the SnapCenter Server. If the minimum requirements are not met appropriate error or warning messages are displayed. If the restart of the host is pending, a warning message is displayed.
4.       In the Network Load Balancing screen, if you want to enable and configure NLB select Enable and configure NLB on the host.
a.        Select Create New NLB Cluster and enter the details for first node.
b.       After creating the NLB cluster on the first node, when you run the installer on a second node, select Join Existing NLB Cluster and enter the details.
5.        On the Credentials screen, enter the credentials that you want to use to log in to SnapCenter as the administrator.
a.        The SnapCenter Server web component and SnapCenter SMCore Service are installed in the corresponding folders at the default location C:\Program Files\NetApp.
b.       The repository component is installed at the default location C:\ProgramData\NetApp\SnapCenter.
6.       On the SnapCenter Ports Configuration screen, enter the port details. The default ports are auto populated but you can specify a custom port. In a NLB setup for the second node, the ports used while installing on the first node are auto populated and are not configurable.
7.        On the MySQL Database Connection screen, enter the MySQL database password.
8.       On the Ready to Install screen, click Install. Log files are listed (oldest first) in the %temp% folder.
SnapCenter Configuration
The default GUI URL is a secure connection to the default port 8146 on the server where the
SnapCenter Server is installed (https://server:8146). If you provided a different server port
during the SnapCenter installation, that port is used instead.
For NLB deployment, you must access SnapCenter using the NLB cluster
IP (https://NLB_Cluster_IP:8146). If you do not see the SnapCenter UI when you navigate to
https://NLB_Cluster_IP:8146 in IE, you must add the NLB IP address as a
trusted site in IE on each plug-in host, or you must disable IE Enhanced Security on each plug-in
host.
Add a User or Group to a Role
To add a user or group to a role, follow these steps:
1.        In the left navigation pane, click Settings.
2.       In the Settings page, click Roles.
3.        In the Roles page, select the role to which you want to add the user.
4.       Click Modify.
5.        Click Next until you reach the Users/Groups page of the wizard.
6.       Select Domain or Workgroup as the Authentication type. For Domain authentication type, you should specify the domain name of the user or group to which you want to add the user to a role.
7.        Select either User or Group.
8.       In the User or Group Name field, enter a user or group name, and then click Add.
9.       Repeat this step to add additional users or groups to the selected role.
10.    Click Next to view the summary, and then click Finish.

To perform data protection and provisioning operations with SnapCenter, you must first set up the storage system connections that give SnapCenter access to ONTAP storage. Storage Systems can also be added thru SnapCenter Plugin for vCenter. Both methods require the same set of information.
Install SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware
Host and Privilege Requirements for the Plug-in for VMware vSphere
Review the following requirements before you install the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere
Â·         You must have SnapCenter admin privileges to install and manage the SnapCenter GUI.
Â·         You must install the Plug-in for VMware vSphere on a Windows host (virtual host or physical host). The Plug-in for VMware vSphere must be installed on a Windows host regardless of whether you use the plug-in to protect data on Windows systems or Linux systems.
Â·         When installing a plug-in on a Windows host, if you specify a Run As account that is not built-in or if the Run As user belongs to a local workgroup user, you must disable UAC on the host.
Â·         Do not install the Plug-in for VMware vSphere on the vCenter Server appliance.
Â·         You must not install the Plug-in for VMware vSphere on the vCenter Server appliance, which is a Linux host. You can only install the Plug-in for VMware vSphere on Windows hosts.
Â·         You must not install other plug-ins on the host on which the Plug-in for VMware vSphere is installed.
Â·         You must install and register a separate, unique instance of the Plug-in for VMware vSphere for each vCenter Server.
-        Each vCenter Server, whether or not it is in Linked mode, must be paired with a separate instance of the Plug-in for VMware vSphere.
-        Each instance of the Plug-in for VMware vSphere must be installed on a separate Windows host. One instance can be installed on the SnapCenter Server host.
-        vCenters in Linked mode must all be paired with the same SnapCenter Server.
For example, if you want to perform backups from six different instances of the vCenter Server, then you must install the Plug-in for VMware vSphere on six hosts (one host can be the SnapCenter Server host) and each vCenter Server must paired with a unique instance of the Plugin for VMware vSphere.
Run As Credentials
Before you can perform data protection operations, you must set up the storage virtual machine connections and add Run As credentials that the SnapCenter Server and the SnapCenter plug-ins use.
1.        Domain administrator or any member of the administrator group. Specify the domain administrator or any member of the administrator group on the system on which you are installing the SnapCenter plug-in. Valid formats for the Username field are:
NetBIOS\UserName
Domain FQDN\UserName
UserName@upn
2.       Local administrator (for workgroups only). For systems that belong to a workgroup, specify the built-in local administrator on the system on which you are installing the SnapCenter plug-in. You can specify a local user account that belongs to the local administrators group if the user account has elevated privileges or the User Access control feature is disabled on the host system. The valid format for the Username field is: UserName
3.        Run As credentials for individual resource groups. If you set up Run As credentials for individual resource groups and the username does not have full admin privileges, you must assign at least the resource group and backup privileges to the username.
To perform data protection and provisioning operations with SnapCenter, first you must set up the storage system connections using SnapCenter Plug-in for vCenter GUI that, to give SnapCenter access to ONTAP storage as described in next section.

Cisco UCS Backup
Automated backup of the Cisco UCS domain is important for recovery of the Cisco UCS Domain from issues ranging from catastrophic failure to human error. There is a native backup solution within Cisco UCS that allows local or remote backup using FTP/TFTP/SCP/SFTP as options and is detailed below.
Backups created can be a binary file containing the Full State, which can be used for a restore to the original or a replacement pair of fabric interconnects. Alternately this XML configuration file consisting of All configurations, just System configurations, or just Logical configurations of the Cisco UCS Domain. For scheduled backups, options will be Full State or All Configuration, backup of just the System or Logical configurations can be manually initiated.
To schedule the backup, follow these steps within the Cisco UCS Manager GUI:
1.        Select Admin within the Navigation pane and select All.
2.       Click the Policy Backup & Export tab within All.
3.        For a Full State Backup, All Configuration Backup, or both, specify the following:
a.        Hostname : <IP or FQDN of host that will receive the backup>
b.       Protocol: [FTP/TFTP/SCP/SFTP]
c.        User: <account on host to authenticate>
d.       Password: <password for account on host>
e.       Remote File: <full path and filename prefix for backup file>
f.         Admin State: <select Enable to activate the schedule on save, Disable to disable schedule on save>
g.       Schedule: [Daily/Weekly/Bi Weekly]
