Introduction
This document describes how to configure a Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) for access to a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server that is located in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), the inside network, or the outside network.
Prerequisites
Requirements
There are no specific requirements for this document.
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
Cisco ASA that runs software Version 9.1 or later
Cisco 2800C Series Router with Cisco IOSÂ® Software Release 15.1(4)M6
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Conventions
Refer to the Cisco Technical Tips Conventions for more information on document conventions.
Configure
This section describes how to configure the ASA in order to reach the mail server in the DMZ network, the inside network, or the outside network.
Note: Use the Command Lookup Tool (registered customers only) to obtain more information on the commands that are used in this section.
Mail Server in the DMZ Network
Network Diagram
The configuration that is described in this section uses this network setup:
Note: The IP addressing schemes that are used in this document are not legally routable on the Internet. They are RFC 1918 addresses that have been used in a lab environment.
The network setup that is used in this example has the ASA with an inside network at 10.1.1.0/24 and an outside network at 203.0.113.0/24. The mail server with IP address 172.16.31.10 is located in the DMZ network. In order for the mail server to be accessed by the inside network, you must configure the identity Network Address Translation (NAT). 
In order for the outside users to access the mail server, you must configure a static NAT and an access list, which is outside_int in this example, in order to permit the outside users to access the mail server and bind the access list to the outside interface.
ASA Configuration
This is the ASA configuration for this example:

ESMTP TLS Configuration
If you use Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for email communication, then the Extended Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (ESMTP) inspection feature (enabled by default) in the ASA drops the packets. In order to allow the emails with TLS enabled, disable the ESMTP inspection feature as shown in the next example.
Note: Refer to Cisco bug ID CSCtn08326 (registered customers only) for more information.

Use the information that is provided in this section in order to verify that your configuration works properly.
Mail Server in the DMZ Network
TCP Ping
The TCP ping tests a connection over TCP (the default is Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)). A TCP ping sends SYN packets and considers the ping successful if the destination device sends a SYN-ACK packet. You can run at most two concurrent TCP pings at a time.
Here is an example:
ciscoasa(config)# ping tcp
Interface: outside
Target IP address: 203.0.113.10
Destination port: [80] 25
Specify source? [n]: y
Source IP address: 203.0.113.2
Source port: [0] 1234
Repeat count: [5] 5
Timeout in seconds: [2] 2
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5 TCP SYN requests to 203.0.113.10 port 25
from 203.0.113.2 starting port 1234, timeout is 2 seconds:
!!!!!
Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 1/1/1 ms
Connection
The ASA is a stateful Firewall, and return traffic from the mail server is allowed back through the Firewall because it matches a connection in the Firewall connection table. The traffic that matches a current connection is allowed through the Firewall without being blocked by an interface Access Control List (ACL).
In the next example, the client on the outside interface establishes a connection to the 203.0.113.10 host of the DMZ interface. This connection is made with the TCP protocol and has been idle for two seconds. The connection flags indicate the current state of this connection:
ciscoasa(config)# show conn  address  172.16.31.10
1 in use, 2 most used
TCP outside  203.0.113.2:16678 dmz  172.16.31.10:25, idle 0:00:02, bytes 921, flags UIO
Logging
The ASA Firewall generates syslogs during normal operation. The syslogs range in verbosity based on the logging configuration. This output shows two syslogs that appear at level six (the informational level) and level seven (the debugging level):
ciscoasa(config)# show logging  | i 172.16.31.10

%ASA-7-609001: Built local-host dmz:172.16.31.10

%ASA-6-302013: Built inbound TCP connection 11 for outside:203.0.113.2/16678
 (203.0.113.2/16678) to dmz:172.16.31.10/25 (203.0.113.10/25)
The second syslog in this example indicates that the Firewall has built a connection in its connection table for this specific traffic between the client and server. If the Firewall was configured in order to block this connection attempt, or some other factor inhibited the creation of this connection (resource constraints or a possible misconfiguration), the Firewall would not generate a log that indicates that the connection was built. Instead, it would log a reason for the connection to be denied or an indication about the factor that inhibited the connection from being created. 
For instance, if the ACL on the outside is not configured to permit 172.16.31.10 on port 25, then you would see this log when the traffic is denied:
%ASA-4-106100: access-list outside_int denied tcp outside/203.0.113.2(3756) ->
   dmz/172.16.31.10(25) hit-cnt 5 300-second interval
This would occur when an ACL is missing or misconfigured as shown here:
access-list outside_int extended permit tcp any4 host 172.16.31.10 eq http

access-list outside_int extended deny ip any4 any4
NAT Translations (Xlate)
In order to confirm that the translations are created, you can check the Xlate (translation) table. The command show xlate, when combined with the local keyword and the internal host IP address, shows all of the entries that are present in the translation table for that host. The next output shows that there is a translation currently built for this host between the DMZ and the outside interfaces. The DMZ server IP address is translated to the 203.0.113.10 address per the previous configuration. The flags that are listed (s in this example) indicate that the translation is static.

Troubleshoot
The ASA provides multiple tools with which to troubleshoot connectivity. If the issue persists after you verify the configuration and check the outputs that are described in the previous section, these tools and techniques might help you determine the cause of your connectivity failure.
Mail Server in the DMZ Network
Packet-Tracer
The packet tracer functionality on the ASA allows you to specify a simulated packet and view all of the various steps, checks, and functions that the Firewall goes through when it processes traffic. With this tool, it is helpful to identify an example of traffic that you believe should be allowed to pass through the Firewall, and use that five-tupple in order to simulate the traffic. In the next example, the packet tracer is used in order to simulate a connection attempt that meets these criteria:
The simulated packet arrives on the outside.
The protocol that is used is TCP.
The simulated client IP address is 203.0.113.2.
The client sends traffic that is sourced from port 1234.
The traffic is destined to a server at IP address 203.0.113.10.
The traffic is destined to port 25.
Here is an example packet tracer output:

Here is an example on the Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM):
Notice that there is no mention of the DMZ interface in the previous outputs. This is by packet tracer design. The tool tells you how the Firewall processes that type of connection attempt, which includes how it would route it and out of which interface.
Tip: For additional information about the packet tracer feature, refer to the Tracing Packets with Packet Tracer section of the Cisco ASA 5500 Series Configuration Guide using the CLI, 8.4 and 8.6.
Packet Capture
The ASA Firewall can capture traffic that enters or leaves its interfaces. This capture functionality is very useful because it can definitively prove whether traffic arrives at, or leaves from, a Firewall. The next example shows the configuration of two captures named capd and capout on the DMZ and outside interfaces, respectively. The capture commands use a match keyword, which allows you to be specific about the traffic that you want to capture.
For the capture capd in this example, it is indicated that you want to match the traffic seen on the DMZ interface (ingress or egress) that matches TCP host 172.16.31.10/host 203.0.113.2. In other words, you want to capture any TCP traffic that is sent from host 172.16.31.10 to host 203.0.113.2, or vice versa. The use of the match keyword allows the Firewall to capture that traffic bidirectionally. The capture command that is defined for the outside interface does not reference the internal mail server IP address because the Firewall conducts an NAT on that mail server IP address. As a result, you cannot match with that server IP address. Instead, the next example uses the word any in order to indicate that all possible IP addresses would match that condition.
After you configure the captures, you should then attempt to establish a connection again and proceed to view the captures with the show capture <capture_name> command. In this example, you can see that the outside host was able to connect to the mail server, as evident by the TCP three-way handshake that is seen in the captures:
ASA#  capture capd interface dmz match tcp host 172.16.31.10 any
ASA#  capture capout interface outside match tcp any host 203.0.113.10

ASA#   show capture capd
