The Cisco
experience
How we interact each day with our teams, leaders,
and meaningful work.
We are self-aware of ourselves and our environment. We feel accountable
and empowered to contribute to a culture where everyone thrives
and where we intentionally seek out, learn, understand, and appreciate
who - and what - surrounds us. That’s what a Conscious Culture is all about.

“Let's demonstrate empathy. Lets be kind to one another. Let's have curiosity. Let's continue to learn. And most importantly, let's take action. In a Conscious Culture, that's our job. We take action if we experience something or if we see something. And in doing so, we change the culture for all.”
