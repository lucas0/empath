Introduction
In future releases, the Firepower User Agent is no longer available. It is replaced by the Identity Services Engine (ISE) or Identity Services Engine - Passive ID Connector (ISE-PIC). If you currently use User Agent and considering migrating to ISE, this document provides considerations and strategies for your migration. 
User Identity Overview
There are currently two methods to extract User Identity information from existing identity infrastructures: User Agent and ISE integration.
User Agent
User Agent is an application installed on a Windows platform. It relies on the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) protocol to access user logon events (event type 4624) and then saves the data to a local database. There are two ways User Agent retrieves the logon events: updated in real-time as user logs in (Windows Server 2008 and 2012 only), or polling the data for every configurable interval. Similarly, User Agent sends data received from Active Directory (AD) to the Firepower Management Center (FMC) in real-time and sends batches of logon data to FMC regularly. 
Types of logins detectable by User Agent include login to a host directly or via Remote Desktop; file-sharing login; computer account login. Other types of logins such as Citrix, network logons, and Kerberos logins are not supported by User Agent.
User Agent has an optional feature to detect if the mapped user has logged off. If the logoff check is enabled, it periodically checks if the "explorer.exe" process is running on each mapped endpoint. If cannot detect the process running then after 72 hours, the mapping for this user is removed.
Identity Services Engine
Identity Services Engine (ISE) is a robust AAA server that manages the user's network login sessions. Since ISE communicates directly with network devices such as switches and wireless controllers, it has access to up-to-date data regarding user's activities, making it a better identity source than the User Agent. When a user logs on to an endpoint, it usually automatically connects to the network, and if dot1x authentication is enabled for the network, ISE creates an authentication session for this user and keeps it alive until the user logs off the network. If ISE is integrated with FMC, it forwards the user-IP mapping (along with other data collected by ISE) data to FMC. 
ISE can be integrated with FMC via pxGrid. pxGrid is a protocol designed to centralize the distribution of session information among ISE servers and with other products. In this integration, ISE acts as a pxGrid Controller and FMC subscribes to the controller to receive session data (FMC does not publish any data to ISE except during remediation which is discussed later) and passes the data to sensors to achieve user awareness.
Identity Services Engine Passive Identity Connector (ISE-PIC) is essentially an instance of ISE with a restricted license. ISE-PIC does not perform any authentication, but instead acts as a central hub for various identity sources in the network, collecting the identity data and providing them to subscribers. ISE-PIC is similar to User Agent in that it also uses WMI to gather login events from AD, but with more robust features known as Passive Identity. It is also integrated with FMC via pxGrid.
Migration Considerations
Licensing Requirements
The FMC does not require additional licenses. Identity Services Engine requires a license if it is not already deployed in the infrastructure. Please refer to the Cisco ISE Licensing Model document for details. ISE Passive ID Connector is a feature set already existing in full ISE deployment, therefore no additional licenses are required if there is an existing ISE deployment. For a new or separate deployment of ISE-PIC, please refer to the Cisco ISE-PIC Licensing document for details.
SSL Certificate
While User Agent does not require Publick Key Infrastructure (PKI) for communications with FMC and Active Directory, ISE or ISE-PIC integration does require SSL certificates shared between ISE and FMC for authentication purposes only. The integration supports Certificate Authority-signed and self-signed certificates, provided that both "Server Authentication" and "Client Authentication" EKU (Extention Key Usage) are added to the certificates.
Identity Source Coverage
User Agent covers only Windows login events from Windows Desktops, with polling-based logout detection. ISE-PIC covers Windows Desktop login plus additional identity sources such as AD Agent, Kerberos SPAN, Syslog Parser, and Terminal Services Agent (TSA). Full ISE has all of ISE-PIC's coverage plus network authentication from non-Windows workstations and mobile devices among other features.

User Agent End of Life
The last version of Firepower to support User Agent is 6.6, which provides a warning that User Agent must be disabled prior to upgrading to later releases. If an upgrade to a version higher than 6.6 is necessary, migration from User Agent to ISE or ISE-PIC must be completed prior to the upgrade. Please refer to the User Agent Configuration Guide for further details.
Compatibility
Please review the Firepower product compatibility guide to ensure the software versions involved in the integration are compatible. Please note that for future Firepower releases, support for later ISE versions may require specific patch levels.
Migration Strategy
Migration from User Agent to ISE or ISE-PIC requires careful planning, execution, and testing to ensure a smooth transition of user identity source for FMC and avoid any impact on user traffic. This section provides best practices and recommendations for this activity.
Preparing for Migration
The next steps can be done before cutting over from User Agent to ISE Integration.
Step 1. Configure ISE or ISE-PIC to enable PassiveID, and establish WMI connection with Active Directory. Please refer to the ISE-PIC Administration Guide.
Step 2. Prepare FMC's identity certificate. It can be either a self-signed certificate issued by FMC or a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) generated on the FMC, to be signed by a private or public Certificate Authority (CA). The self-signed certificate or the root certificate of the CA must be installed on ISE. Please refer to the ISE And FMC Integration Guide for further details.
Step 3. Install the CA root certificate who signed ISE's pxGrid certificate (or the pxGrid certificate if self-signed) on FMC. Please refer to the ISE And FMC Integration Guide for further details.
Cutover Process
FMC-ISE integration cannot be configured without disabling User Agent configuration on FMC since the two configurations are mutually exclusive. This could potentially affect the users during the change. These steps are recommended to be performed during the maintenance window.
Step 1. Enable and verify FMC-ISE integration. Please refer to the ISE And FMC Integration Guide for details.
Step 2. Ensure user activities are reported to FMC navigating to Analysis > User > User Activities page on FMC.
Step 3. Review that user-IP mapping and user-group mapping are available on managed devices on
Analysis > Connections > Events > Table View of Connection Events.
Step 4. Modify the Access Control Policy to temporarily change the action to Monitor to any rules that block traffic depending on the username or user group condition. For rules that allow traffic based on initiator user or group, make a duplicate rule that allows the traffic without user criteria, and then disable the original rule. This step's purpose is to ensure business critical traffic is not impacted during the testing stage after the maintenance window. 
Step 5. After the maintenance window, during normal business hours, observe the Connection Events on FMC to monitor the user-IP mapping. Note that connection events shows user information only if there is an enabled rule that requires user data. Hence why the monitor action is suggested in the past step.
Step 6. Once the desired state is achieved, simply revert the changes done to the Access Control Policies and push policy deployment to managed devices.
