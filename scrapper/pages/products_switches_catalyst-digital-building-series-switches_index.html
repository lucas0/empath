Features and benefits
Intelligence and automation
Catalyst Digital Building Series Switches give you smart, simple, and highly secure access in a very compact and rugged standalone form factor.  The smart and easy mobile installation app helps you install the switch in a snap.
Power lights and more
Innovation in LED lighting increases energy efficiency, cost-savings, and new smart lighting applications. Cisco Universal Power over Ethernet (UPOE) with 60 watts per port, a fan-less design, and energy-efficient operation make our switches the right choice to take control of your digital building.
Modern experiences and analytics
Organizations are seeking innovative ways to optimize and control space usage. Network-enabled connected sensors, HVAC, lighting, access, and more can provide robust connectivity to help you increase building analytics.
Lower installation and operating costs
Simple, low-voltage in-ceiling mounting and mobile app configuration reduces the cost of installation. With twice the power at 60W per port you gain greater luminosity without denser and more complex installations.
