    Cisco Nexus® Dashboard transforms data-center and cloud network operations with simplicity, automation,
and analytics.
Product overview
In this era of digital transformation and business resiliency, continuous innovation is critical for organizations to succeed, and experiencing downtime along the way is not an option. Users increasingly demand more features, better usability, reliability, and environmental sustainability from the applications they use.
The network plays a huge role in meeting such demands, and provisioning reliable data-center and cloud-networking services as fast as possible, when and where organizations need it, is a must. However, network infrastructure management is becoming more complex, diverse, and distributed, with multiple configuration points, monitoring tools, and vast amounts of data generated every second (Figure 1).
Figure 1.            
Network complexity in a hyper-diverse and hyper-distributed world
Having an inconsistent way of configuring, provisioning, and operating the network often leads to human errors, potential security holes, and a reactive break-then-fix model that commonly increases downtime due to manual correlation and endless finger-pointing between teams.
Included with every Cisco Nexus 9000 switch tiered licensing purchase, Cisco Nexus Dashboard provides a single focal point to unite the disparate network configurations and views of multiple switches, data centers, and clouds (Figure 2).
Figure 2.            
Cisco Nexus Dashboard: powering automation and analytics with a unified, agile, and sustainable networking platform
By providing a single point of management that empowers users to provision and operate their networks across different switches, fabrics and locations, Cisco Nexus Dashboard is evolving to become one of the simplest ways to provision, monitor, and manage data-center and cloud networks.
Cisco Nexus Dashboard provides multiple services (Figure 3) that bring the one of the best of cloud-operational models to your networks, whether Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure™ (Cisco ACI), Cisco NX-OS (through the Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller service), or a Cisco® Cloud Network Controller running in a public cloud provider environment.
Figure 3.            
Cisco Nexus Dashboard services
Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator, Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights, and Cisco Nexus Dashboard Data Broker services are being integrated into the Cisco Nexus Dashboard as native services as part of simplifying the overall consumption experience for our customers.
●      Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator allows operators to easily interconnect fabrics and/or clouds over any routed network, facilitating data-center and cloud migrations, as well as network extension across fabrics. Organizations can also centralize network and policy configurations and set up connectivity at scale. Besides rendering configurations defined in the template(s) to the local data center or cloud controller, it enables separation of fault domains, federation of data-center and cloud networks, and business resiliency at a global scale. Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator also enables end-to-end change-management workflows, centralized fabric management and upgrades, multicloud/hybrid-cloud connectivity, normalized segmentation, and security policies across the data center, SD-WAN, and enterprise branch and campus networks. For example, the SD-WAN integration provides application-aware SLA-based routing (policy-based path selection and QoS treatment) in the SD-WAN infrastructure used for interconnecting fabrics.

●      Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights allows operators to minimize downtime by turning hardware and software telemetry (including anomalies and advisories) into insights to identify potential issues and recommendations to fix them, gathering years of experience under a single network-operations platform. It can also take advantage of its analytics to learn more about sustainability, compliance, changes, and traffic behavior (including flow records, drop, congestion, latency, AI/ML RoCEv2, and more). It also minimizes risk by providing pre- and post-upgrade assistance and can enhance visibility by integrating tools from vendors such as VMware, Splunk, ServiceNow, Panduit, Vertiv, and many more. It incorporates a set of advanced alerting, baselining, correlation, and forecasting algorithms to provide a deep understanding into the behavior of the network. The Insights service and AppDynamics® are tightly integrated to pinpoint exactly where and when an application issue originated from a network perspective.

Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights monitors network health across Cisco ACI, Cisco NX-OS, and cloud networks
●      Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC) consolidates management for multiple NX-OS-based switches, bringing automation and monitoring for LAN, EVPN VXLAN, and SAN fabrics. Simply choose an operational mode (LAN, SAN), discover new and/or existing switches, and leverage the benefits of zero-touch provisioning (ZTP), fabric monitoring, backup, faster provisioning and upgrades, and much more. NDFC supports Cisco (including Nexus, Catalyst®, and ASR routers) and third-party devices.

●      Cisco Nexus Dashboard Data Broker provides pervasive packet and network visibility for NetOps and SecOps to programmatically manage aggregating, filtering, and forwarding complete workflows to custom analytics tools. It is a multitenant-capable solution that can be used with both Cisco Nexus and Cisco Catalyst fabrics. It replaces the traditional purpose-built network packet broker appliances with high-throughput Cisco Nexus switches, enabling IT to create cost-effective and scale-out packet broker fabrics.
●      Third-party applications: Cisco Nexus Dashboard offers an open API model with a rich suite of services for third-party developers to build applications. REST APIs allow third-party tools to authenticate and integrate with key services such as Nexus Dashboard Insights and Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator. Currently supported third-party integrations in the Nexus Dashboard ecosystem include ServiceNow ITSM/ITOM, Splunk SIEM, HashiCorp Terraform, and Red Hat Ansible.
With Cisco Nexus Dashboard, you get a unified operations view across all your fabrics and clouds, and the services they consume. It scales out based on the size and number of fabrics and the operational services used to manage them.
The Nexus Dashboard Admin Console (Figure 7) informs the operator of the health of the various clusters, fabrics, clouds, and infrastructure services to quickly detect issues and their root cause, allowing users to toggle between the different Cisco Nexus Dashboard services as needed.

Prominent features
Seamless operator experience powered by Cisco Nexus Dashboard
Too often the network operations team spends most of its time gathering troubleshooting data to triage and root cause an issue. The burden of tying together siloed insights from a fragmented operational toolkit often lies with the operations team. As the company’s data-center footprint extends from the on-premises data center to the cloud, and as modern application architectures become the de-facto standard, the operations team needs a unified operations toolchain with a seamless user experience to maintain and operate such complex environments.
Cisco Nexus Dashboard unifies these disparate toolsets and experiences for the operations teams to consume the rich and powerful capabilities of day-2 operations solutions and executes multi-fabric policies from a single pane of glass. Unnecessary handoffs between toolchains and dealing with multiple portals and credentials to get to troubleshooting data and insights have become a thing of the past. Cisco Nexus Dashboard offers a powerful and rich set of capabilities, such as:
●      Single sign-on (SSO): SSO powers the frictionless interaction between Cisco Nexus Dashboard and the hosted services. The operator logs in once and is able to switch seamlessly between services and also site controllers such as Cisco APIC, Cisco Cloud Network Controller, or Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller.
●      Unified operations platform: The Cisco Nexus Dashboard platform is a powerful unified platform capable of scaling out horizontally to accommodate application needs. With a modern microservices infrastructure services stack on a clustered architecture, the same underlying platform can be used to cohost the entire day-2 applications portfolio, thus reducing the burden of underlying software and hardware lifecycle maintenance.
●      Sustainability: Nexus Dashboard Insights provides detailed reports on power consumption, energy sources, and emission rates for your fabrics based on location. Additional integrations with leading power-management vendors Panduit and Vertiv deliver new sustainability insights to enable our customers to gain real-time and historical insights into the power consumption of the IT equipment in their data center and estimate the energy footprint of their operations.
Figure 8.            
Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights’ Sustainability Report provides a persona-based dashboard giving RBAC-based access to the different services and sections within the Nexus Dashboard platform.
●      Common infrastructure services: Cisco Nexus Dashboard provides a host of common infrastructure services, such as common site onboarding, authentication domains, role-based access control (RBAC), notification services, and API services.
●      Flexible deployment options: Cisco Nexus Dashboard portfolio comprises physical, virtual, and cloud form factors, giving customers unprecedented flexibility while deploying their operations infrastructure and at the same time ensuring a common and unified operator experience through a single pane of glass.
●      Programmable infrastructure: Third-party automation tools are critical to improving reporting workflows and responding to issues encountered by distributed workloads. Cisco Nexus Dashboard has built-in integrations with many third-party services such as ServiceNow, one of the most prevalent IT service management platforms. With the ServiceNow integrations, NetOps and DevOps teams can open and track tickets from within Nexus Dashboard. From one portal, operations teams get visibility into the status of open tickets, resulting in the automation of troubleshooting for faster resolutions across fabrics.
●      SR-MPLS with Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator: With Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator, SR-MPLS policies can be centrally automated across 5G telco cloud fabrics (central, regional, and edge data centers). Cisco Nexus Dashboard with Insights and Orchestrator services is the most comprehensive way to automate distributed data centers―overcoming the challenges of managing the infrastructure, applications, and data sources distributed over disparate locations.
With these services integrated in Cisco Nexus Dashboard, NetOps teams can achieve command and control over global network fabrics, optimizing performance and attaining insights into data-center and cloud operations.
