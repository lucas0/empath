Information About Managing HSEC Licenses
Devices that use Smart Licensing Using Policy, and that must support an encrypted traffic throughput of 250 Mbps or greater, require an HSEC license. This is a requirement of US export control regulation.
You can use Cisco vManage to install HSEC licenses. Cisco vManage contacts Cisco Smart Software Manager (SSM), which provides a smart license authorization code (SLAC) to load onto a device. Loading the SLAC on a device enables an HSEC license.
Figure 1. Cisco vManage Requests HSEC Licenses for Devices
Use the following workflow:
Synchronize license information between Cisco Smart Software Manager (SSM) and Cisco vManage for all HSEC-compatible devices.
See Synchronize HSEC Licenses, Online Mode and Synchronize HSEC Licenses, Offline Mode.
Install the HSEC licenses on the desired devices.
See Install HSEC Licenses.
Benefits of Managing HSEC Licenses
Benefits of Managing HSEC Licenses
By addressing numerous license-related tasks, including the installation of HSEC and other licenses, Cisco vManage consolidates the workflow for license management. Installing HSEC licenses using Cisco vManage makes it unnecessary to install HSEC licenses individually by CLI.
For information about managing Smart Licensing Using Policy for devices in the network, see Manage Licenses for Smart Licensing Using Policy.
Supported Devices for Managing HSEC Licenses
HSEC-compatible Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices
Prerequisites for Managing HSEC Licenses
Cisco SSM account with the required licenses.
HSEC-compatible devices available in the Cisco vManage device list.
Synchronizing license information between Cisco SSM and Cisco vManage requires one of the following:
Online method: Internet access for Cisco vManage.
Cisco vManage must be able to connect to Cisco SSM.
Offline method: Access to your Cisco SSM account through an internet-connected web browser.
Restrictions for Managing HSEC Licenses

Description
Installing HSEC licenses using Cisco vManage
Cisco vManage does not query devices to determine whether they have an HSEC license installed. If you install an HSEC license on a device without using Cisco vManage, then Cisco vManage does not account for that license, and continues to list the device as eligible for an HSEC license. If you use Cisco vManage to install the same HSEC license that has already been installed outside of Cisco vManage, there is no change to the license. If you use Cisco vManage to install a different HSEC license on the device, the device will have two HSEC licenses installed.
You can use the show license authorization command on a device to check whether the device has an HSEC license installed.
Uninstalling an HSEC license
Cisco vManage does not support uninstalling an HSEC license from a device. If you need to do this to release the license for use elsewhere, contact Cisco TAC for assistance. If you uninstall the HSEC license from a device with assistance from TAC, Cisco vManage will not be able to correctly report the HSEC license status for the device.
Generic HSEC entitlement tag
The introduction of Cisco Digital Network Architecture (Cisco DNA) licensing changed how entitlement tags work for HSEC licenses. Instead of tagging licenses according to a router model (for example, ISR_4331_Hsec), HSEC licenses are generic, tagged as DNA_HSEC.
Note
  This change does not apply to the Cisco Catalyst 8000V.
For devices using Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a or later, use an HSEC license with a generic DNA_HSEC entitlement tag rather than a license tagged according to the router model. However, if you have an HSEC license tagged according to a specific router model, you can use one of the following workarounds to use the license with Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a or later or to convert the license:
Option 1: Install a smart license authorization code (SLAC) for a device-specific HSEC license in offline mode. To do this, use the procedures described in the following sections of Smart Licensing Using Policy for Cisco Enterprise Routing Platforms:
Generating and Downloading SLAC from CSSM to a File
Installing a File on the Product Instance
Option 2: Convert a device-specific HSEC license to a DNA_HSEC license, as follows:
Order a DNA-HSEC-UPGD= license, at no charge, from the Cisco Commerce Workspace.
Convert the device-specific HSEC license to a DNA_HSEC license, using the Converting a Device-Specific HSECK9 License procedure described in Smart Licensing Using Policy for Cisco Enterprise Routing Platforms.
Install a SLAC on the device to enable you to use the DNA_HSEC license.
Option 3: Downgrade the device to a release earlier than Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a, install the HSEC license, then upgrade the Cisco IOS XE software to a later release. The router continues to use the installed HSEC license.
Synchronize HSEC Licenses, Online Mode
Information about synchronizing HSEC licenses in the online mode.
Before You Begin
This procedure requires Cisco vManage to have internet access. If Cisco vManage does not have internet access, such as for security reasons, use the Synchronize HSEC Licenses, Offline Mode procedure.
This procedure requires entering credentials for your Cisco Smart Account
Synchronize HSEC Licenses, Online Mode
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Workflows > Workflow Library.
Click the Sync and Install HSEC Devices workflow.
Click Sync Licenses and then click Next.
Click Online and then click Next.
Enter the credentials for your Cisco SSM account and then click Next.
On the HSEC Device Activation Overview page, click Next.
On the Select Virtual Account page, choose a virtual account from the drop-down list. The list is populated by the Cisco SSM account that you logged into in a previous step.
On the Select HSEC-Compatible Devices page, select the devices on which you want to install an HSEC license and then click Summary.

Note
If an HSEC-compatible device already has an HSEC license installed by Cisco vManage, then the device is not selectable.
Review the summary and then click Assign to begin the synchronization. Cisco vManage loads the requested licenses from Cisco SSM and assigns them to the devices.
The process of loading and assigning licenses may take several minutes. You can monitor the progress by viewing the Cisco vManage task list.
After the HSEC licenses have been loaded and assigned, to install them, use the Install HSEC Licenses procedure.
Synchronize HSEC Licenses, Offline Mode

Troubleshooting HSEC Licenses
Problem
Cisco SSM has assigned two HSEC licenses (a product-ID-specific PID license, and a Cisco DNA software subscription license) to one or more devices. This scenario is called double entitlement.
Possible Cause
The following scenario may cause Cisco SSM to have two licenses assigned to a device:
You have have installed a PID-specific HSEC license on a device using Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.x or earlier.
You upgrade the device to use Cisco IOS XE Release 17.9.1a or later.
You perform a license synchronization using Cisco vManage.
Solution
Reload the device. When the device restarts, confirm that it is using only the Cisco DNA software subscription HSEC license.
