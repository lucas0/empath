    This document describes the features, issues, and deployment guidelines for Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator software.
Cisco Multi-Site is an architecture that allows you to interconnect separate Cisco APIC, Cloud APIC, and DCNM domains (fabrics) each representing a different region. This helps ensure multitenant Layer 2 and Layer 3 network connectivity across sites and extends the policy domain end-to-end across the entire system.
Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator is the intersite policy manager. It provides single-pane management that enables you to monitor the health of all the interconnected sites. It also allows you to centrally define the intersite configurations and policies that can then be pushed to the different Cisco APIC, Cloud APIC, or DCNM fabrics, which in term deploy them in those fabrics. This provides a high degree of control over when and where to deploy the configurations.

Note: The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.

For more information, see the “Creating VRFs” sections of the Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator Configuration Guide for DCNM Fabrics.
Fault information for DCNM objects in Orchestrator GUI
Any faults generated for VRF and Network objects in DCNM can now be viewed directly in the Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator GUI by selecting the specific objects.
Scale improvements
This release of Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator supports up to 12 DCNM sites.
For more information, see Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator Verified Scalability Guide.
New Hardware Features
There is no new hardware supported in this release.
The complete list of supported hardware is available in the “Deploying Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator” chapter of the Cisco Multi-Site Deployment Guide.
Changes in Behavior
If you are upgrading to this release, you will see the following changes in behavior:
●     For all new deployments, you must install the Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator services in Nexus Dashboard release 2.0.2h or later.
Note that the cloud Nexus Dashboard release 2.0.2h clusters support Cisco APIC and Cisco Cloud APIC site on-boarding only. If you want to use Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator service to manage Cisco DCNM sites, you will need to deploy one of the other form factors or Nexus Dashboard release 2.1.1, which supports all sites on all form factors.
●     If you are upgrading your existing deployment from a release prior to Release 3.2(1), you must deploy a new Nexus Dashboard cluster and migrate your existing configuration.
The procedure is described in detail in Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator Deployment Guide.
●     If you deploy in a virtual or cloud Nexus Dashboard, downgrading to releases prior to Release 3.3(1) is not supported.
●     If you deploy in a physical Nexus Dashboard cluster, downgrading to releases prior to Release 3.2(1) is not supported.
●     If you are migrating from an earlier release to Release 3.3(1) or later, you may need to resolve any configuration drifts in the object properties that are newly managed by MSO where the default values picked by MSO differ from the custom values set directly in the fabrics' controllers.
Any time Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator adds support for managing object properties that previously had to be managed directly in the APIC, it sets those properties to some default values for existing objects in MSO Schemas but does not push them to sites.
To resolve the configuration drifts, you will need to re-import these objects and their properties from the fabrics’ Controllers and then re-deploy the templates as described in the Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator Deployment Guide.
●     Site management and on-boarding have moved to a centralized location in the Nexus Dashboard GUI.
When migrating from a release prior to Release 3.2(1), you will need to on-board the sites using the Nexus Dashboard GUI before restoring existing configuration. The procedure is described in detail in Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator Deployment Guide.
●     User management and authentication have moved to a centralized location in the Nexus Dashboard GUI.
Existing local users defined in older Orchestrator clusters will be transferred to the Nexus Dashboard during configuration import.
For existing remote authentication users, you will need to add the remote authentication server to the Nexus Dashboard as described in the Nexus Dashboard User Guide.
●     Starting with Release 3.3(1), the following API changes have been implemented:
PATCH API no longer returns the complete object that was modified, in contrast to prior releases where a complete object (such as schema) was returned by the API.
Because Site Management and User Management have moved to a central location on Nexus Dashboard, the following API changes have been implemented to the corresponding Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator APIs:
◦    User Management API v2 is introduced for querying the new user structures with original API changing to read-only mode (only GET operations are allowed, PUT/POST are removed).
The issue which caused the User Management API v1 to incorrectly return v2 structures in Release 3.2 has been resolved and the v1 API now returns the correct structure similar to Release 3.1.
◦    Site Management API v2 is introduced that allows setting a site to 'managed' or 'unmanaged' in NDO. Previous Site Management APIs are changed to read-only mode (GET operation only). Site onboarding moved to the Nexus Dashboard APIs.
You can no longer remove DHCP Relay and DHCP Option policies until they have been removed from all associated BDs.
●     Starting with Release 3.4(1), local configuration backups have been deprecated.
If you are upgrading from a release prior to release 3.4(1) to release 3.4(1) or later, you must download any existing local configuration backups prior to the upgrade. You will then be able to import those configuration backups to a remote backup location you configure in the Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator. For more information, see the “Operations” chapter of the Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator Configuration Guide for ACI Fabrics or Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator Configuration Guide for DCNM Fabrics.

For Cisco Multi-Site, Fabric IDs Must be the Same for All Sites, or the Querier IP address Must be Higher on One Site.
The Cisco APIC fabric querier functions have a distributed architecture, where each leaf switch acts as a querier, and packets are flooded. A copy is also replicated to the fabric port. There is an Access Control List (ACL) configured on each TOR to drop this query packet coming from the fabric port. If the source MAC address is the fabric MAC address, unique per fabric, then the MAC address is derived from the fabric-id. The fabric ID is configured by users during initial bring up of a pod site.
In the Cisco Multi-Site Stretched BD with Layer 2 Broadcast Extension use case, the query packets from each TOR get to the other sites and should be dropped. If the fabric-id is configured differently on the sites, it is not possible to drop them.
To avoid this, configure the fabric IDs the same on each site, or the querier IP address on one of the sites should be higher than on the other sites.
CSCvd61787
STP and "Flood in Encapsulation" Option are not Supported with Cisco Multi-Site.
In Cisco Multi-Site topologies, regardless of whether EPGs are stretched between sites or localized, STP packets do not reach remote sites. Similarly, the "Flood in Encapsulation" option is not supported across sites. In both cases, packets are encapsulated using an FD VNID (fab-encap) of the access VLAN on the ingress TOR. It is a known issue that there is no capability to translate these IDs on the remote sites.
CSCvi61260
If an infra L3Out that is being managed by Cisco Multi-Site is modified locally in a Cisco APIC, Cisco Multi-Site might delete the objects not managed by Cisco Multi-Site in an L3Out.
CSCvq07769
"Phone Number" field is required in all releases prior to Release 2.2(1). Users with no phone number specified in Release 2.2(1) or later will not be able to log in to the GUI when Orchestrator is downgraded to an earlier release.
CSCvu71584
Routes are not programmed on CSR and the contract config is not pushed to the Cloud site.
CSCvw47022
Shadow of cloud VRF may be unexpectedly created or deleted on the on-premises site.
CSCvt47568
Let's say APIC has EPGs with some contract relationships. If this EPG and the relationships are imported into MSO and then the relationship was removed and deployed to APIC, MSO doesn't delete the contract relationship on the APIC.
