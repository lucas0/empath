Introduction
This article describes the process of issuing a license by using product activation key (PAK) fulfillment.
Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure that:
You have the following data at your disposal:
Active Cisco.com account
Administrator or User access to a Smart Account (To request Administrator or User access to a Smart account, refer to How to Request Access to an Existing Smart Account.)
Universal Device Identifier (UDI)
Your product activation key (PAK) is assigned to your Smart Account (To verify that the product activation key (PAK) is assigned to a Smart account, refer to How to Verify That a PAK Is Assigned to a Smart Account.)
Issuing a License by Using PAK Fulfillment
Step 1: 
Go to Cisco Software Central and log in with your Cisco.com account.
Step 2:
In the Traditional Licenses section, click Access LRP.
Step 3:
In the Show Smart AccountandVirtual Accountdrop-down lists, confirm that the correct respective accounts are selected.
Note: If the system displays the Welcome To The License Registration Portal alert dialog box, you can select Do not show this message again to prevent it from being displayed again.
Step 4:
On the PAKS or Tokens tab, select the check box next to the product activation key (PAK) for which you need to issue the license. Click the blue circled chevron icon, and select Get Licenses.
Step 5:
In the Get New License from a Single PAK/Token dialog box, on the Assign SKUs tab, from the Virtual Account drop-down list, select the Virtual Account. Select the SKU quantities (if applicable) by clicking the radio button. Click Next.
Note: If you select Specific Quantities, add the quantity in the Quantity per Device field.
Step 6:
On the Assign to Devices tab, enter values in the mandatory fields, and then click Next.
Note: The information requested on the Assign to Devices tab varies depending on a product for which you want to issue the license key. Refer to Table 1.
