   Problem Description
Sbunetwork Manager (SNM) Software Release 1.1 requires a minimum network control board (NCB) level of 800-09474-02. The SNM Release 1.1 software does not support any previous NCB version. Before customers decide to upgrade to SNM Release 1.1 software, ensure that the NCB board is at the minimum level of 800-09474-02.
Background
A limited number of customers received NCBs with a level of 800-09474-01. This level is not compatible with SNM Release 1.1 software. To check the NCB part number and serial number log in as Administrator or Operator and use the command version.
