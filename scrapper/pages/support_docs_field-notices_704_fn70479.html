Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCvs10585 Access points manufactured with wrong domain
Problem Description
A newly installed Access Point (AP) fails to join its controller or it joins the controller, but is only able to bring up one radio due to a manufacturing mismatch between the AP's domain and the radio's domain.
On a Mobility Express (ME) AP, the 2.4GHz radio will come up in Day 0 mode; however, after you configure the correct country code, the internal AP might fail to rejoin or might bring up only one radio.
Background
In the manufacturing process, the radios for some APs were set for regulatory domains which do not match the Product ID (PID).
Problem Symptom
Errors similar to these are seen in an AireOS Wireless LAN Controller's (WLC's) msglog:

Errors similar to these are seen in a 9800 Series Wireless LAN Controller's (WLC's) log:
*Jan  7 14:00:06.144: %APMGR_TRACE_MESSAGE-3-EWLC_GEN_ERR: Chassis 1 R0/0: wncd: Error in d4e8.801a.3080 AP will be disconnected. Regulatory domain validation failed during configuration phase. Country code: XX
Workaround/Solution
Use the Wireless LAN Compliance Lookup Tool in order to validate that your country code matches your PID.
If you observe the same symptom and have validated that the correct countries are configured on your controller for your APs, but your serial number does not show up in the Serial Number Validation Tool, open a Technical Assistance Center (TAC) Service Request (SR) to conduct further troubleshooting.
If you have an affected unit whose serial number is matched in the Serial Number Validation Tool, contact TAC to get a replacement unit.
How To Identify Affected Products
In order to find the serial number for your AP, complete one of these actions:
From the AireOS CLI, enter the show ap inventory all or show ap inventory APNAME command.
From the AP CLI, enter the show inventory command.
An example of where the serial number is located on the AP2800/AP3800/AP4800 is shown here:
An example of where the serial number is located on the AP1815 is shown here:
  An example of where you can find the serial number on the AP's box is shown here:
