Configure an IdP for the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal
When you log in to the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal for the first time, you have the option to configure the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal to use the identity provider (IdP) of your organization, such as Okta Identity Management.

Note
Configuring an IdP for the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal is optional.
After you configure your IdP and roles (as described in Configure Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal Roles for IdP Users, you can log in using your own IdP instead of your Cisco.com account credentials.

Note
When you set up an IdP in the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal, the issuer, login URL, and privacy-enhanced mail (PEM) key are not available from the IdP of your organization. This information is available after you set up the Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL and audience in your organization's IdP. When setting up your organization's IdP, we recommend that you add placeholder values for the ACS URL and audience. Later, you can configure the IdP on the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal and update your organization's IdP with the correct value of the ACS URL and audience Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that is editable in the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal.
