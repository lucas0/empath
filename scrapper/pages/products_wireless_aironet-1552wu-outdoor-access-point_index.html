A High-Performance Outdoor Access Point
The Cisco Aironet 1552WU Outdoor Access Point is designed for hazardous environments like mining pits, oil and gas refineries, and manufacturing facilities, as well as for process control applications. The 1552WU combines a ruggedized outdoor 802.11n access point with an integrated WirelessHART gateway for wireless sensor networks.
Features and Capabilities
This access point offers mission-critical connectivity and wireless mobility for industrial sensing and monitoring equipment, such as gauges for water treatment plants, sensors for chemical plants, and vibration monitoring solutions for oil rigs.
It improves overall plant reliability, safety, and profitability through a flexible, highly secure, and scalable mesh network. It offers high-performance wireless coverage for both Wi-Fi clients and WirelessHART field instruments across large facilities.
In addition, the 1552WU lowers operating expenses and reduces deployment times by:
Integrating the Emerson Smart Wireless Gateway(PDF - 202 KB) for WirelessHART sensor networks
Eliminating extra power and network connections, which can be expensive to deploy and maintain in hazardous locations
Providing high-bandwidth video surveillance over Wi-Fi without the need to install cables over long distances
