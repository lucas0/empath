Document history
    Video traffic continues to grow rapidly. Nearly two-thirds of the global population will have internet access by 2023. There will be 5.3 billion
total internet users (66 percent of global population) by 2023, up from 3.9 billion (51 percent of global population) in 2018. Each year, various new devices in different form factors with increased capabilities and intelligence are introduced and adopted in the market. Networks need to be designed with “web scale” in mind. A web-scale network needs to scale at deployment speed while being operationally simple. The
Cisco Network Convergence System (NCS) 1004 High-Density QSFP-DD Transponder provides the largest flexibility to transport any kind of
different service along with complete automation and real-time visibility to deliver a multipurpose/multifunctional card for a variety of different
applications.
Product overview
The Cisco NCS 1004 High-Density QSFP-DD Transponder (Figure 1) is a single-slot line card capable of supporting 16xQSFP-DD ports, -8xQSFP-DD client ports with 400GE, 100GE and OTU4 interfaces (available in roadmap) and 8xQSFP-DD trunk ports.
Each NCS 1004 chassis provide four line card slots, and the Cisco NCS 1004 High-Density QSFP-DD Transponder can be placed in any of them to fill maximum capacity of the shelf (4x).
Figure 1.               
NCS 1004 High-Density QSFP-DD Transponder
The Cisco NCS 1004 High-Density QSFP-DD Transponder line card supports the following optics on client and trunk: QSFP-DD, QDD-ZR, QDD-ZR+, QDD-ZR++, QSFP-100G-LR-S, QSFP-100G-FR-S, and QSFP-100G-DR-S.
The line card supports the following functionalities:
1.     8 x 400GE Transponder
2.     8 x 4 x 100GE Muxponder
3.     100GE Transponder mode
4.     4 x ZR/ZR+/ZR++ regens (available in roadmap)
5.     Encryption with 0dBm QSFP-DD
Management
The Cisco NCS 1004 provides comprehensive management capabilities to support Operations, Administration, Maintenance, and Provisioning (OAM&P) capabilities through IOS XR CLI, SNMP, syslog, and XML. In addition, iPXE for automated software download and Zero-Touch Provisioning (ZTP) for automated configuration download are available for simplified installation. For machine-to-machine configuration and management of NCS 1004, NETCONF, RESTCONF, and gRPC transport protocols with JSON, XML, and GPB encoding are provided. OpenConfig protocols for management GNMI and operations GNOI are also supported. The NCS 1004 provides a set of native YANG models as well as the ability to map into any industry standard or customer-defined YANG data models. For monitoring, NCS 1004 provides a streaming telemetry feature that relies on a push mechanism to disseminate user-selected PM and status information at user-specified frequencies at granular 10-second intervals. This improves monitoring speed and scale compared to traditional pull-based mechanisms such as SNMP. The telemetry infrastructure also allows for events such as alarms and port-state changes to be notified.
The NCS 1004 High=Density QSFP-DD Transponder can be managed completely using CLI or XML.
OpenConfig is supported for 4x100GE MXP and 400GE TXP configurations.
In the upcoming software releases, the line card is capable of supporting remote node management with GCC Functionality, and the line card is capable of supporting AES-256 encryption of the data with IKEv2 between two end points.
Performance monitoring
The Cisco NCS 1004 supports performance monitoring of optical parameters on the client and DWDM line interface, including laser bias current, transmit, and receive optical power. Ethernet RMON statistics for the client ports and OTN error counters for the trunk are also available. Calculation and accumulation of the performance-monitoring data are supported in 15-minute and 24-hour intervals as per G.7710.
Wavelength tunability
The line interface supports software-provisionable tunability across the full C band, covering 96 channels across 191.25 to 196.10 THz (1528.77 to 1566.72 nm).
Key elevator pitch
The Cisco NCS 1004 High-Density QSFP-DD Transponder takes advantage of DCO optics innovation without router dependency and compliment high-performance transponder cards with low-cost, low-power, dense, and simple TXP/MXP options.
The typical use cases for the line card includes:
●     Customer router infrastructure that is not 400G ready
●     Web/MSDC niche use cases
●     Optical transport applications at service providers
●     Encryption use cases
●     Regen use cases in the Cisco Routed Optical Network
Licensed transponder
The Cisco NCS 1004 High-Density QSFP-DD Transponder supports both smart and electronic licensing. The base licensed hardware will not have any capacity by default. The user must purchase incremental QDD trunk licenses – unencrypted and encrypted. There is no distinction between MXP, TXP, or regen modes.
The following licenses shall be purchased:
S-N1K-QXP-TRK-L=: Smart license for NCS 1004 QDD-TXP trunk
E-N1K-QXP-TRK-L=: E-delivery license for NCS 1004 QDD-TXP trunk
S-N1K-QXP-TRKE-L=: Smart license for NCS 1004 encrypted QDD-TXP trunk
E-N1K-QXP-TRKE-L=: E-delivery license for NCS 1004 encrypted QDD-TXP trunk
