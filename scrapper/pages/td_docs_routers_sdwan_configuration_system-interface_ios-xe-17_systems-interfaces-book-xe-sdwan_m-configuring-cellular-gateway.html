Cellular Gateway Configuration
Cisco vManage Release 20.4.1
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.4.1a (on devices)
This feature provides templates for configuring a supported cellular gateway as an IP pass-through device. This release supports the Cisco Cellular Gateway CG418-E and CG522-E.
You can configure a supported cellular gateway as an IP pass-through device. By positioning the configured device in an area in your facility that has a strong LTE signal, the signal can be extended over an Ethernet connection to a routing infrastructure in a location with a weaker LTE signal.
To configure a cellular gateway in Cisco vManage:
Create a device template for the Cisco Cellular Gateway CG418-E device.
See "Create a Device Template from Feature Templates" in Systems and Interfaces Configuration Guide.
After you enter a description for the feature template:
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Templates.
Click Device Templates.

Note
In Cisco vManage Release 20.7.x and earlier releases, Device Templates is titled Device.
From the Create Template drop-down list choose From Feature Template.
From the Device Model drop-down list select the type of device for which you are creating the template.
Choose Cellular Gateway > Cellular Gateway Platform > Create Template. Then configure the Cellular Gateway Platform feature template as shown in the following table.

Parameter Name
Description
Basic Configuration Tab
Time Zone
Choose the time zone to use for the device. The device uses this time zone for clock synchronization when NTP is configured.
Management Interface
Enter the IPv4 address of the management interface for accessing the device.

Failover-Timer (minutes)
Enter the number of minutes that the device waits before trying to communicate with the primary SIM slot after the device detects loss of service to this slot.
Max-Retry
Enter the number of consecutive unsuccessful attempts by the device to communicate with the primary SIM before failing over to the secondary slot
Choose Cellular Gateway > Cellular Gateway Profile and choose Create Template from the Cellular Gateway Profile drop-down list. Then configure the Cellular Gateway Profile feature template as shown in the following table.
