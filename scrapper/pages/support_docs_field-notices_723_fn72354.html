Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCwa85640 Server Name Indication not supported
Problem Description
Starting 2022-05-01, the affected Identity Services Engine (ISE) versions can no longer obtain updates online for posture and client provisioning without use of a proxy.
Background
Server Name Indication (SNI) is an extension of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol that allows multiple secure (HTTPS) websites (or any other service over TLS) to be served from the same IP address without requiring all those sites to use the same certificate.  As a security measure, the Cisco cloud service for online posture and client provisioning updates will require the use of SNI starting 2022-05-01. The affected versions of ISE do not support the SNI extension in the TLS protocol and will not be able to establish a connection with online posture and client provisioning update services without use of a proxy. 
Problem Symptom
Connections to the Cisco site for online posture and client provisioning updates will fail with an error. The online posture updates error displayed on the ISE console is shown in this image.
  The client provisioning error displayed on the ISE console is shown in this image.
Workaround/Solution
Solution
In order to continue to use online posture and client provisioning update services, upgrade the ISE system software to ISE Release 2.4 Patch 5 or later.
Workaround
If an upgrade to the ISE system software is not immediately possible, complete one of these actions:
Set up a proxy server. In order to do so, refer to the “Configure Proxy Settings in Cisco ISE” process in the respective Cisco Identity Services Engine Administrator Guide document for the ISE version used. In order to determine if the proxy server supports SNI, refer to the proxy server’s documentation.
Perform the "Cisco ISE Offline Updates" process. In order to do so, see the respective Cisco Identity Services Engine Release Notes document for the ISE version used.
