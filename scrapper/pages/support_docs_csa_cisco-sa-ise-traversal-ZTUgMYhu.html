Summary
Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated attacker to perform path traversal attacks on the underlying operating system to either elevate privileges to root or read arbitrary files. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must have valid Administrator credentials on the affected device.
For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.
Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

Affected Products
Vulnerable Products
At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected Cisco ISE.
For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.
Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.
Details
The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.
Note: These vulnerabilities can be exploited only by valid and authorized users of the Cisco ISE system. As a best practice, customers can restrict console access and admin web access. To configure the access restrictions, choose Administration > System > Admin Access > Settings > Access > IP Access.
Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:
CVE-2023-20166: Cisco ISE Path Traversal Vulnerability
A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a path traversal attack to escape the restricted shell and gain root privileges on the underlying operating system.
This vulnerability is due to improper validation of parameters that are sent by a certain CLI command within the restricted shell. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to a device and issuing a certain crafted CLI command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escape the restricted shell and gain root privileges on the underlying operating system of the affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be an authenticated shell user.
Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
Bug ID(s): CSCwd07350
CVE ID: CVE-2023-20166
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Medium
CVSS Base Score: 6.0
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
CVE-2023-20167: Cisco ISE Path Traversal Vulnerability
A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system of an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have valid Administrator level privileges on the affected device.
This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files of specific types from the underlying operating system.
Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Fixed Software
When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page, to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.
In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
