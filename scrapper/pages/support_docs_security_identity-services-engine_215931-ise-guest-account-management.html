Introduction
This document describes the frequently used actions that a sponsor or an ISE administrator can take on guest data present on ISE. Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) guest services provide secure network access to guests such as visitors, contractors, consultants, and customers. 
Contributed by Shivam Kumar, Cisco TAC Engineer.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have the knowledge of these topics:
ISE
ISE guest services
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
Cisco ISE, Release 2.6
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Note: The procedure is similar or identical for other ISE versions. One can use these steps on all 2.x ISE Software Releases unless stated otherwise.
Configure
Use a Sponsor to Manage Guest Accounts
Sponsors are user accounts on ISE that have the privilege to log in to sponsor portal where they can create temporary guest accounts for authorized visitors and manage them. A sponsor can be an internal user or an account present on an external identity store such as an active directory.
In this example, the sponsor account is defined internally on ISE and added to the predefined group: ALL_ACCOUNTS.
By default, ISE has three sponsor groups that sponsors can be mapped to:
ALL_ACCOUNTS (default): Sponsors assigned to this group can manage all guest user accounts. By default, users in the ALL_ACCOUNTS user identity group are members of this sponsor group.
GROUP_ACCOUNTS (default):  Sponsors assigned to this group can manage just the guest accounts created by sponsors from the same sponsor group. By default, users in the GROUP_ACCOUNTS user identity group are members of this sponsor group.
OWN_ACCOUNTS (default): Sponsors assigned to this group can manage only the guest accounts that they have created. By default, users in the OWN_ACCOUNTS user identity group are members of this sponsor group.
The sponsor account used in this example is mapped to ALL_ACCOUNTS:
The permissions and privileges of this sponsor group are available at Work Centres> Guest Access > Portal & Components > Sponsor Groups:
In order to allow a sponsor access to guest management via ERS REST API, permission is added in the sponsor's group as seen in the image.
Use Active Directory Account as Sponsor
Along with internal user accounts defined as sponsors, accounts present on external identity sources such as Active Directory (AD) or LDAP can also be used as sponsor to manage guest accounts.
Ensure that the ISE is joined to AD by navigating to Administration> Identities > External Identity Sources > Active Directory. If not already joined, join one of the available AD domains.
Retrieve the groups from AD that contains the accounts:
This example demonstrates adding AD user to ALL_ACCOUNTS Sponsor group.
Navigate to Work Centres> Guest Access > Portal & Components > Sponsor Groups> ALL_ACCOUNTS and then click on Members, as shown in this image.
 The Members show all the available groups to choose from; select the AD group and move it to the right to add it to the sponsor group.
Save the changes. Sponsor portal login now works with AD user accounts that are part of the selected AD group.
The same steps above can be followed to add users via LDAP. Internally defined user identity groups are also available as an option to add to sponsor groups.
Use one such sponsor account to login to sponsor portal. The sponsor portal can be used to:
Edit and delete guest accounts
Extend guest account duration
Suspend guest account
Reinstate expired guest accounts
Resend and reset passwords for guests
Approve pending guest accounts
On the sponsor portal, select the Manage Accounts tab to see all the guest accounts that this sponsor is authorized to manage, as shown in this image.
A guest account can be edited regardless of the state that they are in.
There is an option to resend the guest account password in case the account holder forgets or loses them. A guest account's password can only be resent if they are either in Active or Created state.
Passwords cannot be resent for guests who have changed them. For that case, the reset password option must be used first. Password cannot be sent for accounts that are pending approval, suspended, expired or denied.
A sponsor may choose the option to receive a copy of the changed password:
In case there is a need to allow guest access to the network for a period longer than originally permitted, use the extended option to increase duration. Accounts in Created, Active or Expired state can be extended.
An account that has been suspended or denied, cannot be extended; use the reinstate option instead.
The maximum allowed extension period is governed by the account's guest type.
Guest accounts expire on their own when they reach the end of account duration, regardless of their state. Suspended or expired guest accounts are automatically purged based on purge policy defined on the system. By default, they are purged every 15 days.
Guest account states and their meaning:
Active: Guests with these accounts have successfully signed in through a credentialed Guest portal, or bypassed the credentialed Guest captive portal. In the latter case, the accounts belong to guest types that are configured to bypass the credentialed Guest captive portal. These guests can access the network by providing their login credentials to the native supplicant on their device.
Created: The accounts have been created, but the guests have not yet logged in to a credentialed Guest portal. In this case, the accounts are assigned to guest types that are not configured to bypass the credentialed Guest captive portal. Guests must first sign in through the credentialed Guest captive portal before they are able to access other parts of the network.
Denied: The accounts are denied access to the network. Accounts that expired while in a denied state remain as denied.
Pending Approval: The accounts are awaiting approval to access the network.
Suspended: The accounts are suspended by a sponsor who has the privilege to do so.
Guest Purge Policies
By default, ISE automatically purges expired guest accounts every 15 days. This information can be seen under Work Centers > Guest Access > Settings > Guest Account Purge Policy.
Date of Next Purge indicates when the next purge will occur. The ISE administrator can:
Schedule a purge to occur every X days. The Time of Purge specifies when the first purge happens in X days. After that, the purge occurs every X days.
Schedule a purge on a given day of the week, every X weeks.
Force an on-demand purge using the option Purge Now.
When expired guest accounts are purged, the associated endpoints, reporting, and logging information are retained.
Endpoint Purge: Inactive Days vs Elapsed Days for Endpoints
The endpoints that guests use to access the network become the part of GuestEndpoints by default. ISE has the policy to delete Guest endpoints and registered devices that are older than 30 days. This default purge job runs at 1 AM every day based on the time zone configured on the Primary Admin Node (PAN). This default policy uses the condition of ElapsedDays. Other options available are InactiveDays and PurgeDate.
Note: Endpoint Purge functionality is independent of Guest Account Purge Policy and Guest Account Expiration.
Policy is defined under Administration > Identity Management > Settings > Endpoint Purge.
Elapsed Days: This refers to the number of days since the object was created. This condition can be used for endpoints that have been granted unauthenticated or conditional access for a set time period, such as a guest or contractor endpoint, or employees leveraging webauth for network access. After the allowed connect grace period, they must be fully reauthenticated and registered.
Inactive Days: Refers to the number of days since the last profiling activity or update on the endpoint. This condition purges stale devices that have accumulated over time, commonly transient guests or personal devices, or retired devices. These endpoints tend to represent noise in most deployments as they are no longer active on the network or likely to be seen in the near future. If they do happen to connect again, then they will be rediscovered, profiled, registered, etc as needed. 
When there are updates from the endpoint, InactivityDays will be reset to 0 only if profiling is enabled. 
Purge Date: Date to purge the endpoint. This option can be used for special events or groups where access is granted for a specific time, regardless of creation or start time. This allows all endpoints to be purged at the same time. For example, a trade show, a conference, or a weekly training class with new members each week, where access is granted for a specific week or month rather than absolute days/weeks/months. 
This sample profiler.log file shows when endpoints which were part of GuestEndpoints and had elapsed 30 days were purged:
