12.0(26)S
This command was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 12.0(26)S.
Usage Guidelines
Use the debug interface counters exceptions command to debug problems where the packet counter values or rates have unexpected values. The command helps to flag interfaces whose packet counter values have decreased in number. This condition can occur if a packet is counted and then dropped. This command helps you to determine if the input and output rate statistics are adjusted to display a zero value versus an unexpected value. It is also possible for zero values to be displayed if an interface is running at or close to its maximum capacity due to interface statistics being viewed as negative values.
This message is rate limited to one message per minute. If multiple interfaces are having unexpected counter statistic issues, then a message is displayed only for the first interface that experiences a problem within a minute.
Examples
The following is sample output from the debug interface counters exceptions command when backward-going counters are detected. The output is self-explanatory.
Router# debug interface counters exceptions
IF-4-BACKWARD_COUNTERS: Corrected for backward rx_bytes counters (561759 -> 526385) on Multilink1

This command was introduced.
12.2(44)S
This command was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 12.2(44)S.
Usage Guidelines
This command helps to debug interface state transition problems and includes the following interface state related message outputs:
BRIDGE_ADJ--bridging database and Spanning tree protocol (STP) port state adjustment
CSTATE_REQ--carrier state change request
CSTATE_TMR--carrier timer state change
LSTATE_REQ--line protocol state change request
LSTATE_TMR--line protocol timer state change
ROUTE_ADJ--route adjustment
TRANS_ADJ--state transition adjustment
The debug information can be restricted to display state transitions on an interface basis using the debug condition interface command.

Caution
Because the debug interface states command is a global debug command for all the interfaces in the router, in some cases such as with online insertion and removal (OIR) this command generates a substantial amount of output, depending on the number of interfaces hosted on the shared port adapter (SPA) or the line card. Use the debug condition interface command instead for debugging an interface state transition problem.
Examples
The following is sample output from the debug interface statescommand when the shutdown command is executed on an interface. The output is self-explanatory.

Usage Guidelines
The debug ip access-list turboaclcommand is useful for debugging problems associated with turbo ACLs. Turbo ACLs compile the ACLs into a set of lookup tables, while maintaining the first packet matching requirements. Packet headers are used to access these tables in a small, fixed, number of lookups, independent of the existing number of ACL entries.
Examples
The following is sample output from the debug ip access-list turboaclcommand:

12.2(33)SRA
This command was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 12.2(33)SRA.
Usage Guidelines
Use the debug ip auth-proxy command to display authentication proxy activity.

Note
The function-trace debugging information provides low-level software information for Cisco technical support representatives. No output examples are provided for this keyword option.
Examples
The following examples illustrate the output of the debug ip auth-proxy command. In these examples, debugging is on for object creations, object deletions, HTTP, and TCP.
In this example, the client host at 192.168.201.1 is attempting to make an HTTP connection to the web server located at 192.168.21.1. The HTTP debugging information is on for the authentication proxy. The output shows that the router is setting up an authentication proxy entry for the login request:
00:11:10: AUTH-PROXY creates info:
cliaddr - 192.168.21.1, cliport - 36583
seraddr - 192.168.201.1, serport - 80
ip-srcaddr 192.168.21.1
pak-srcaddr 0.0.0.0 
Following a successful login attempt, the debugging information shows the authentication proxy entries created for the client. In this example, the client is authorized for SMTP (port 25), FTP data (port 20), FTP control (port 21), and Telnet (port 23) traffic. The dynamic access control list (ACL) entries are included in the display.
00:11:25:AUTH_PROXY OBJ_CREATE:acl item 61AD60CC
 
00:11:25:AUTH-PROXY OBJ_CREATE:create acl wrapper 6151C7C8 -- acl item 61AD60CC

00:11:25:AUTH-PROXY OBJ_CREATE:create acl wrapper 6187A0D4 -- acl item 61A40B88
00:11:25:AUTH-PROXY Src 192.168.162.216 Port [0]
00:11:25:AUTH-PROXY Dst 192.168.162.220 Port [21]
00:11:25:AUTH_PROXY OBJ_CREATE:acl item 61879550
 
00:11:25:AUTH-PROXY OBJ_CREATE:create acl wrapper 61879644 -- acl item 61879550
00:11:25:AUTH-PROXY Src 192.168.162.216 Port [0]
00:11:25:AUTH-PROXY Dst 192.168.162.220 Port [23]
The next example shows the debug output following a clear ip auth-proxy cache command to clear the authentication entries from the router. The dynamic ACL entries are removed from the router.
00:12:36:AUTH-PROXY OBJ_DELETE:delete auth_proxy cache 61AD6298
00:12:36:AUTH-PROXY OBJ_DELETE:delete create acl wrapper 6151C7C8 -- acl item 61AD60CC
00:12:36:AUTH-PROXY OBJ_DELETE:delete create acl wrapper 6187A060 -- acl item 6151C908
00:12:36:AUTH-PROXY OBJ_DELETE:delete create acl wrapper 6187A0D4 -- acl item 61A40B88
00:12:36:AUTH-PROXY OBJ_DELETE:delete create acl wrapper 61879644 -- acl item 61879550
The following example shows the timer information for a dynamic ACL entry. All times are expressed in milliseconds. The first laststart is the time that the ACL entry is created relative to the startup time of the router. The lastref is the time of the last packet to hit the dynamic ACL relative to the startup time of the router. The exptime is the next expected expiration time for the dynamic ACL. The delta indicates the remaining time before the dynamic ACL expires. After the timer expires, the debugging information includes a message indicating that the ACL and associated authentication proxy information for the client have been removed.
00:19:51:first laststart 1191112
 
00:20:51:AUTH-PROXY:delta 54220 lastref 1245332 exptime 1251112
00:21:45:AUTH-PROXY:ACL and cache are removed

12.2(33)SRA
This command was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 12.2(33)SRA.
Usage Guidelines
The output of this command displays information about update-group calculations and the addition and removal of update-group members. Information about peer-groups, peer-policy, and peer-session templates will also be displayed in the output of this command as neighbor configurations change.

Note
The output of this command can be very verbose. This command should not be deployed in a production network unless you are troubleshooting a problem.
When a change to outbound policy occurs, the router automatically recalculates update-group memberships and applies the changes by triggering an outbound soft reset after a 1-minute timer expires. This behavior is designed to provide the network operator with time to change the configuration if a mistake is made. You can manually enable an outbound soft reset before the timer expires by entering the clear ip bgp ip-address soft out command.

Note
In Cisco IOS Release 12.0(25)S, 12.3(2)T, and prior releases the update group recalculation delay timer is set to 3 minutes.
Examples
The following sample output from the debug ip bgp groups command shows that peering has been established with neighbor 10.4.9.8 and update-group calculations are occurring for this member:
Router# debug ip bgp groups

15.2(4)S
This command was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S.
Usage Guidelines
The output of this command displays information about the identification and creation of BGP dynamic subnet range neighbors. BGP dynamic neighbors are configured using a range of IP addresses and BGP peer groups. After a subnet range is configured for a BGP peer group, and a TCP session is initiated for an IP address in the subnet range, a new BGP neighbor is dynamically created as a member of that group. The new BGP neighbor will inherit any configuration or templates for the group.
Examples
The following output shows that the debug ip bgp range command has been entered and a BGP neighbor at 192.168.3.2 has been dynamically created using the subnet range 192.168.0.0/16. This new neighbor is a member of the peer group named group192.

Usage Guidelines
The debug ip bgp ssocommand is used to display BGP-related SSO events or debugging information for BGP-related interactions between the active RP and the standby RP. This command is useful for monitoring or troubleshooting BGP sessions on a provider edge (PE) router during an RP switchover or during a planned In-Service Software Upgrade (ISSU).
Examples
The following is sample output from the debug ip bgp sso command with the events keyword. The following output indicates that the 10.34.32.154 BGP session is no longer SSO capable.
*Mar 28 02:29:43.526: BGPSSO: 10.34.32.154 reset SSO and decrement count

Tip
Use the show ip bgp vpnv4 all neighborscommand to display the reason that the SSO-capable BGP session has been disabled.
The following is sample output from the debug ip bgp sso command with the transactions keyword. The following output shows an SSO notification indicating that the SSO capability is pending for 602 BGP neighbors. This notification is generated as the state between the active and standby RP is being synchronized during the bulk synchonization phase of SSO initialization. During this phase, the Transmission Control Blocks (TCBs) must be synchronized with the TCBs on the standby RP before SSO initialization is complete.

Use the debug ip ddns update command to verify that your configurations are working properly. The following sample configurations are shown for demonstration of possible debug output that could display for each configuration.
Examples
The following scenario has a client configured for IETF DDNS updating of address (A) Resource Records (RRs) during which a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server is expected to update the pointer (PTR) RR. The DHCP client discovers the domain name system (DNS) server to update using an Start of Authority (SOA) RR lookup since the IP address to the server to update is not specified. The DHCP client is configured to include an fully qualified domain name (FQDN) DHCP option and notifies the DHCP server that it will be updating the A RRs.

In the following scenario, the debug output shows the HTTP-style DDNS updates. The sample configuration defines a new IP DDNS update method named dyndns that configures a URL to use when adding or changing an address. No URL has been defined for use when removing an address since DynDNS.org does not use such a URL for free accounts. A maximum update interval of 28 days has been configured, which specifies that updates should be sent at least every 28 days. Configuring the new “dyndns” update method should be used for Ethernet interface 1.

This command was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 12.2(33)SRA.
Usage Guidelines
This command displays debugging messages for the DFP agent subsystem.
See the following caution before using debug commands:

Caution
Because debugging output is assigned a high priority in the CPU process, it can render the system unusable. For this reason, use debug commands only to troubleshoot specific problems or during troubleshooting sessions with Cisco technical support staff. Moreover, it is best to use debug commands during periods of lower network flows and fewer users. Debugging during these periods reduces the effect these commands have on other users on the system.
Examples
The following example configures a DFP agent debugging session:
Router# debug ip dfp agent
DFP debugging is on
The following example stops all debugging:
Router# no debug all
All possible debugging has been turned off
debug ip dhcp server

Usage Guidelines
This command enables the writing of DNS name list event messages to system message logging (syslog) output. A DNS name list event can be either of the following:
The addition or removal of a DNS name list entry (a hostname pattern and action to perform on an incoming DNS query for a hostname that matches the pattern). To add or remove a DNS name list entry, use the ip dns name-list command.
The removal of a DNS name list.

Note
The addition of a DNS name list is reported as an addition of a name list entry.
To display which debugging options are enabled (DNS name list, DNS view, or DNS view list), use the show debugging command. To display the syslog history statistics and buffer contents, use the show logging command. To display a particular DNS name list or all configured name lists, use the show ip dns name-list command.
Examples
The following sample output from the debug ip dns name-list command shows the hostname pattern www.example.com being added to DNS name list 1 as a permit clause. Next, the hostname patterns www.example1.com and www.example2.com are added to DNS name list 2 as deny clauses and permit clauses, respectively. Finally, the hostname pattern www.example1.com is removed from DNS name list 2.

The following lines show that a protocol update report has been sent to all known multicast groups. Hosts use Internet Group Management Protocol ( IGMP) reports to communicate with routers and to request to join a multicast group. In this case, the router is sending an IGMP report for every known group to the host, which is running mrouted. The host then responds as though the router were a host on the LAN segment that wants to receive multicast packets for the group.

debug ip error
To display IP errors, use the debug ip error command in privileged EXEC mode. To disable debugging errors, use the no form of this command.
debug ip error access-list-number [detail] [dump]
no debug ip error
Syntax Description
access-list-number
(Optional) The IP access list number that you can specify. If the datagram is not permitted by that access list, the related debugging output (or IP error) is suppressed. Standard, extended, and expanded access lists are supported. The range of standard and extended access lists is from 1 to 199. The range of expanded access lists is from 1300 to 2699.
detail
(Optional) Displays detailed IP error debugging information.
dump
(Hidden) Displays IP error debugging information along with raw packet data in hexadecimal and ASCII forms. This keyword can be enabled with individual access lists and also with the detail keyword.
Note   
The dump keyword is not fully supported and should be used only in collaboration with Cisco Technical Support. See the caution notes below, in the usage guidelines, for more specific information.
Command Default
No default behavior or values.
Command Modes

Privileged EXEC
Usage Guidelines
This command is used for IP error debugging. The output displays IP errors which are locally detected by this router.

Caution
Enabling this command will generate output only if IP errors occur. However, if the router starts to receive many packets that contain errors, substantial output may be generated and severely affect system performance. This command should be used with caution in production networks. It should only be enabled when traffic on the IP network is low, so other activity on the system is not adversely affected. Enabling the detail and dump keywords use the highest level of system resources of the available configuration options for this command, so a high level of caution should be applied when enabling either of these keywords.

Caution
The dump keyword is not fully supported and should be used only in collaboration with Cisco Technical Support. Because of the risk of using significant CPU utilization, the dump keyword is hidden from the user and cannot be seen using the “?” prompt. The length of the displayed packet information may exceed the actual packet length and include additional padding bytes that do not belong to the IP packet. Also note that the beginning of a packet may start at different locations in the dump output depending on the specific router, interface type, and packet header processing that may have occurred before the output is displayed.
Examples
The following is sample output from the debug ip errorcommand:
Router# debug ip error
 
IP packet errors debugging is on
04:04:45:IP:s=10.8.8.1 (Ethernet0/1), d=10.1.1.1, len 28, dispose ip.hopcount
The IP error in the above output was caused when the router attempted to forward a packet with a time-to-live (TTL) value of 0. The “ip.hopcount” traffic counter is incremented when a packet is dropped because of an error. This error is also displayed in the output of the show ip traffic command by the “bad hop count” traffic counter.
The table below describes the significant fields shown in the display.
Table 20 debug ip error Field Descriptions
Field
Description
IP:s=10.8.8.1 (Ethernet0/1)
The packet source IP address and interface.
d=10.1.1.1, len 28
The packet destination IP address and prefix length.
dispose ip.hopcount
This traffic counter increments when an IP packet is dropped because of an error.
The following is sample output from the debug ip errorcommand enabled with the detail keyword:
Router# debug ip error detail
IP packet errors debugging is on (detailed)
1d08h:IP:s=10.0.19.100 (Ethernet0/1), d=10.1.1.1, len 28, dispose udp.noport

1d08h:IP:s=10.0.19.100 (Ethernet0/1), d=10.2.2.2, len 28, dispose ip.hopcount
1d08h:    UDP src=33691, dst=33434
The detailed output includes layer 4 information in addition to the standard output. The IP error in the above output was caused when the router received a UDP packet when no application was listening to the UDP port. The “udp.noport” traffic counter is incremented when the router drops a UDP packet because of this error. This error is also displayed in the output of the show ip traffic command by the “no port” traffic counter under “UDP statistics.”

debug ip ftp
To activate the debugging option to track the transactions submitted during an FTP session, use the debug ip ftp command in privileged EXEC mode. To disable debugging output, use the no form of this command.
debug ip ftp
no debug ip ftp
Syntax Description
This command has no arguments or keywords.
Command Modes

Privileged EXEC
Usage Guidelines
The debug ip ftp command is useful for debugging problems associated with FTP.
While configuring the ftp password, only encryption types 0 and 7 are allowed. Other encryption types will invoke an "Invalid encryption type" error.
If encryption type 7 has been chosen, the cli will check if the supplied password is encrypted (encrypted by Cisco proprietary algorithm). If the supplied password is found to be Cisco-encrypted, it will be configured. Otherwise the error "Invalid encrypted password" will be shown. The option 7 expects a Cisco-encrypted password to be supplied in the cli.
While configuring the ftp password, if encryption type 0 has been chosen, the cli will encrypt the password as long as the "service password-encryption" is enabled.
Examples
The following is an example of the debug ip ftpcommand:
Router# debug ip ftp
