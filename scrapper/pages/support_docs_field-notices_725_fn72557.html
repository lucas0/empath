Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCwc95269 ESA : Unable to connect to the Cisco Aggregator Server
Problem Description
The internal Certificate Authority (CA) trust store used by the Cisco Aggregator (Click Tracking) service does not include the root CA IdenTrust Commercial Root CA 1. Due to this, any Secure Email Gateway (ESA) that runs an impacted version of AsyncOS will lose Click Tracking functionality once the existing https://aggregator.cisco.com/ certificate has expired and is renewed using the IdenTrust Commercial Root CA 1 root CA.
Background
For enhanced security, the certificate supplied to https://aggregator.cisco.com/ will be renewed using a CA of HydrantID Server CA O1, which is then further issued by the root CA IdenTrust Commercial Root CA 1. The current DigiCert certificate will expire in February 2024, and customers who utilize Click Tracking will be required to upgrade to a fixed AsyncOS release before this time in order to avoid disruption to their service.
Problem Symptom
This alert will be seen:
Unable to connect to the Cisco Aggregator Server.
Details: (60, 'SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate'
In addition to the alert, the same message can be observed within the cloud_connector logs:
An error occurred when fetching the URL click track record data from the Cisco Aggregator Server: (60, 'SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate')
Workaround/Solution
In order to resolve this issue, upgrade to one of these fixed AsyncOS versions:
14.2.2-004 or later
14.3.0-020 or later
Customers who currently use or plan to use a FIPS-compliant AsyncOS version should upgrade to 14.2.2. Customers who require FIPS certification should upgrade to 15.0, which is tentatively scheduled to be released in April of 2023.
