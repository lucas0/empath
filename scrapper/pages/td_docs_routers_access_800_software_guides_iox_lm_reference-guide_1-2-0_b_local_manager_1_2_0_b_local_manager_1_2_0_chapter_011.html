App Lifecycle Workflows
App lifecycle workflows include the operations that you use to add, activate, deactivate, start, stop, upgrade, and delete an app.
There is no limit, other than system resource restrictions, on the number of apps that can simultaneously have the status of DEPLOYED, For PAAS apps, there also is no limit on how many can simultaneously have the status of ACTIVATED, or STARTED. For VM apps, only one can have the status of ACTIVATED or STARTED at a time.
The following sections describe these workflows:
Adding/Deploying an App
Activating an App
Deactivating an App
Starting an App
Stopping an App
Upgrading an App
Deleting an App
Adding/Deploying an App
Adding an app uploads the app tarball (a file in tar format) to the host system. After you add the app, it appears on the Cisco IOx Local Manager Applications page and has status DEPLOYED. System CPU and RAM resources are not yet reserved for the app. An app with this status can be activated, upgraded, or deleted.
To add an app, perform the following steps.
Before You Begin
Make sure that the app tarball is stored in a local or network location that the system from which you logged in to Cisco IOx Local Manager can access.
Procedure
SUMMARY STEPS
Choose Applications from the Cisco IOx Local Manager menu bar.
Click the Add/Deploy button on the Applications page.
In the Deploy application dialog box, take these actions:
In the Successfully Deployed dialog box, click OK .
DETAILED STEPS
Step 1
Choose Applications from the Cisco IOx Local Manager menu bar.
The Applications page displays.
Step 2
Click the Add/Deploy button on the Applications page.
The Deploy application dialog box displays.
Step 3
In the Deploy application dialog box, take these actions:
In the Application ID field enter, a unique identifier to be assigned to the app.
The identifier can contain up to 64 letters, numbers, and underscores (_), in any combination.
Click the Choose File button and follow the on-screen prompts to locate and select the app tarball.
Click the OK button.
The file uploads to the host system. This process can take some time. When the upload completes, the Successfully Deployed dialog box displays.
To ensure that the upload completes successfully, do not refresh your browser or attempt another Cisco IOx Local Manager operation while the upload is in process.
Step 4
In the Successfully Deployed dialog box, click OK .
Activating an App
Activating an app reserves host system CPU and memory (RAM) resources that the app requires to run, designates the network from which the app obtains its IP address, and assigns host system serial ports for use by the app, if requested. After you activate an app, its status on the Cisco IOx Applications page appears as ACTIVATED.
You can activate an app that has a status of DEPLOYED.
As part of the activation process, you designate a resource profile for the app. A resource profile designates the amount of CPU and memory resources that the app needs to run. You can choose from several preset resource profiles or enter custom values for a profile. See the App-ID Resources Page for more information.
When an app is activated, the host system reserves the resources that the app needs to run, but the resources are not used until the app starts. You cannot activate an app if the host system does not have sufficient resources available for the app to run.
In addition, for a PAAS app, the appropriate cartridges must be installed before the app can be activated.
To activate an app, follow these steps:
Procedure
SUMMARY STEPS
Choose Applications from the Cisco IOx Local Manager menu bar.
Make sure that DEPLOYED appears in the Status field for the app that you want to activate.
Click activate in the Actions field for the app that you want to activate.
Makes sure that the Resources tab is selected on the App-ID page.
In the Resource Profile area, take either of these actions to choose a resource profile, which designates the host system CPU and memory resources that the app requires when it runs:
In the Network Configuration area, choose an option from each drop-down to designate the logical network from which the app obtains its IP address for the corresponding the port.
(Optional) If the app metadata requests TCP or UDP ports to be open on a network interface and if the interface is connected to a NAT network, take these actions to configure how TCP and UDP ports on the host system are mapped to internal ports of the app:
(Optional) To manually configure ethX TCP and UDP port mappings for a NAT network, take the following actions.
In the Serial Access Configuration area, click the radio button or buttons that correspond to the host system serial port or ports that you want to assign for use by the app.
Click the Activate button at the bottom of the Resources tab.
DETAILED STEPS
Step 1
Choose Applications from the Cisco IOx Local Manager menu bar.
The Applications page displays.
Step 2
Make sure that DEPLOYED appears in the Status field for the app that you want to activate.
Step 3
Click activate in the Actions field for the app that you want to activate.
The App-ID page for the app appears.
Step 4
Makes sure that the Resources tab is selected on the App-ID page.
Step 5
In the Resource Profile area, take either of these actions to choose a resource profile, which designates the host system CPU and memory resources that the app requires when it runs:
To use a preset or default resource profile, choose the option that you want from the Profile drop-down list.
The system enters information in the CPU and Memory fields based on the option that you choose. In this case, these fields become read only.
To enter your own values for a resource profile, choose Custom from the Profile drop-down list. Then, in the CPU field, enter the number of CPU units that the app requires when it runs, and in the Memory field, enter the amount of RAM, in MB, that the app requires when it runs.
Make sure that you do not enter a CPU or memory value that exceeds the available CPU or memory resources that are displayed at the bottom of the Resource Profile area. If you enter a value that exceeds resource availability, the app cannot be activated.
If needed, refer to the app documentation or developer for information regarding resources that an app requires when it runs.
Step 6
In the Network Configuration area, choose an option from each drop-down to designate the logical network from which the app obtains its IP address for the corresponding the port.
The ports in this area appear as ethX , where X is a number. The number of ports depend on the number of network interfaces that the app defines in its metadata. For example, if the app metadata defines one network interface, eth0 appears in the this area. If the app metadata defines two network interfaces, eth0 and eith1 appear in this area.
The options that appear in the drop-down list include either of the following terms in their descriptions:
bridge —Indicates that an app obtains its IP address from a DCHP pool that is configured in Cisco IOS
nat —Indicates that an app obtains its IP address from an internal network address translator.
# is a number that matches the number at the end of the corresponding interface name of the internal Cisco IOx bridge that provides connectivity for an internal network. For example, the logical network iox-bridge0 corresponds to the interface name svcbr_0. Similarly, the logical network iox-nat1 corresponds to the interface name svcbr_1. See the System Setting Page for related information.
description is the description of the network as defined on the System Setting page.
Step 7
(Optional) If the app metadata requests TCP or UDP ports to be open on a network interface and if the interface is connected to a NAT network, take these actions to configure how TCP and UDP ports on the host system are mapped to internal ports of the app:
Click the Port Mapping link that corresponds to the network interface for which you want to configure port mapping. (This link appear only if the app metadata requests TCP or UDP ports to be open on a network interface and if the interface is connected to a NAT network.)
Take either of these actions in the Port Mapping dialog box that appears:
To cause the system to map ports automatically, click the Auto radio button. The system takes this action by default.
To enter port mapping information manually, click the Custom radio button. The Port Mapping table provides a description of each internal port and the corresponding internal ports that the app requests, as defined in the metadata for the app. In each the External Port(s) field, enter the ports on the host system to which you want to map the corresponding internal ports.
Click the OK button.
Step 8
(Optional) To manually configure ethX TCP and UDP port mappings for a NAT network, take the following actions.
If you skip this step, the system configures these port mappings automatically based on a range of ports that is defined in the Cisco IOx configuration.
In the Network Configuration area, click the Port Mapping link that corresponds to the logical NAT network for which you want to configure port mappings.
The Port Mapping dialog box appears. This dialog box lists the TCP and UDP internal ports that are defined by the metadata for the app. It also lists the external ports to which each internal port is mapped. An external port value of auto indicates that the system assigns external ports for NAT automatically.
In the Port Mapping dialog box that displays, click the custom radio button.
If you click the Auto radio button, the system assigns external ports for NAT automatically, and the other options in this dialog box are not available for editing.
In each External Port(s) field, enter the port or port range to which the corresponding internal port should be mapped. To enter a port range, separate the first and last port in the range with a hyphen (-).
Click the OK button.
Step 9
In the Serial Access Configuration area, click the radio button or buttons that correspond to the host system serial port or ports that you want to assign for use by the app.
This area appears only if the app metadata requests that a serial port on the host system be assigned for use by the app.
Step 10
Click the Activate button at the bottom of the Resources tab.
If sufficient CPU and memory resources are available on the host system, the activation process executes. This process can takes some time.
To ensure that the activation completes successfully, do not refresh your browser or attempt another Cisco IOx Local Manager operation while the activation is in process.
Deactivating an App
Deactivating an app releases the host system CPU and memory (RAM) resources that were reserved for the app and makes these resources available of other uses. After you deactivate an app, its status on the Cisco IOx Applications page appears as DEPLOYED.
You can deactivate an app that has a status of ACTIVATED or STOPPED.

Cartridge Management Workflows
A Cisco IOx app can be a PAAS type, a KVM type, LXC app, or a Docker type. Unlike a KVM, Docker, or LXC, a PAAS app, which typically is created with a higher level language such as Java or Python, is in a package that contains only files for the app logic. The package does not include Linux operating system files or the root file system that the app requires.
To activate, a PAAS app requires cartridges, which are Cisco-provided files that you install on the host system.
If an app requires cartridges but the cartridges are not yet installed, you can still add the app in Cisco IOx Local Manager. However, you must install the required cartridges before you can activate the app. To determine whether an app requires cartridges, you can look at the Cartridge Required field on the App-ID > App-Info page. See the App-ID App-info Page for more information.
Cartridge management workflows include the operations that you use to install, delete, and view information about cartridges. The following sections describe these workflows:
