Introduction
This document describes how to configure ISE and Windows supplicant for Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) Chaining with Tunnel-based Extensible Authentication Protocol (TEAP).
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:
ISE
Configuration of windows supplicant
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
Cisco ISE version 3.0
Windows 10 build 2004
Knowledge of protocol TEAP
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Background Information
TEAP is a tunnel-based Extensible Authentication Protocol method that establishes a secure tunnel and executes other EAP methods under the protection of that secured tunnel.
TEAP authentication occurs in two phases after the initial EAP identity request/response exchange.
In the first phase, TEAP uses the TLS handshake to provide an authenticated key exchange and to establish a protected tunnel. Once the tunnel is established, the second phase begins with the peer and the server engages in further conversation to establish the required authentications and authorization policies.
Cisco ISE 2.7 and later supports the TEAP Protocol. The type-length-value (TLV) objects are used within the tunnel to transport authentication-related data between the EAP peer and the EAP server.
Microsoft introduced the support for TEAP in the version Windows 10 2004 released in MAY 2020.
EAP chaining allows the user and machine authentication within one EAP/Radius session instead of two separate sessions.
Previously, to achieve this you needed the Cisco AnyConnect NAM module and use EAP-FAST on the windows supplicant as the native Windows supplicant did not support this. Now, you can use the Windows Native Supplicant to perform EAP Chaining with ISE 2.7 with the use of TEAP.
Configure
Cisco ISE Configuration
Step 1. You need to edit the Allowed Protocols to enable TEAP and EAP Chaining.
Navigate to  ISE > Policy > Policy Elements > Results > Authentication > Allowed Protocols > Add New . Check the TEAP and EAP chaining check boxes.
Step 2. Create a certificate profile and add it to the Identity Source Sequence.
Navigate to  ISE > Administration > Identities > identity Source Sequence and choose the certificate Profile.
Step 3. You need to call this sequence in the Authentication Policy.
Navigate to ISE > Policy > Policy Sets  . Choose the Policy Set for  Dot1x > Authentication Policy  and choose the Identity source sequence created in Step 2.
Step 4. Now you need to modify the Authorization Policy under the Dot1x Policy Set.
Navigate to   ISE > Policy > Policy Sets  . Choose the Policy Set for  Dot1x > Authentication Policy  .
You need to create two rules. The first rule checks that the machine is authenticated but the user is not. The second rule verifies that both the user and the machine are authenticated.
This completes the configuration from the ISE Server side.
Windows Native Supplicant Configuration
Configure the wired authentication setting in this document.
Navigate to Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center > Change Adapter Settings and right-click on  LAN Connection > Properties. Click on the  Authentication tab.
Step 1. Click on  Authentication drop-down and choose  Microsoft EAP-TEAP.
  Step 2. Click the  Settings button next to TEAP.
Keep Enable Identity Privacy enabled with anonymous as the identity.
Put a checkmark next to the root CA server(s) under Trusted Root Certification Authorities that are used to sign the certificate for EAP authentication on the ISE PSN.
Step 3. Under Client Authentication, choose the EAP method for authentication to Microsoft: Smart Card or other certificate.
Step 4. For each EAP method dropdown, click the  Configure button and modify as per requirement and click  OK.

Step 5. Click the  Additional Settings button at the bottom.
Enable Specify authentication mode.
Set the drop-down to the appropriate setting.
Choose User or computer authentication so that both are authenticated and click OK.
Verify
You can reboot the Windows 10 machine or you can sign out and then sign in. Whenever the windows login screen is displayed, machine authentication is triggered. 
In the live logs, you see anonymous, host/Administrator (here is the machine name) in the identity field. You see anonymous because you configured supplicant for identity privacy above.
When you log in to the PC with credentials, you can see in the live logs Administrator@example.local, host/Administrator. This is EAP chaining where both user and machine authentication happened in one EAP session.
Detailed Authentication Report  
In the Live Log Details, Machine authentications only show a single NACRadiusUsername entry but the chained user and machine authentication shows two entries (one for the user, and one for the machine). Also, you see under the  Authentication Details section, that  TEAP (EAP-TLS) was used for the  Authentication Protocol. If you use  MSCHAPv2 for machine and user authentication, the authentication protocol shows  TEAP (Microsoft: Secured password (EAP-MSCHAP v2)).
Machine Authentication
User and Machine Authentication
Troubleshoot
You need to enable these debugs on ISE: 
runtime-AAA
nsf
nsf-session
Active Directory (to troubleshoot between ISE and AD)

On Windows, you can check the Event Viewer logs.
