Deliver High-Performing Advanced Services
The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Embedded Service Processors (ESPs) are based on an innovative new Cisco processor for next-generation forwarding and queuing in silicon. The Cisco ASR 1000 Series 20 Gbps ESP is supported on the Cisco ASR 1004 and 1006 Routers. On the Cisco ASR 1006 Router, it can be deployed in a redundant configuration.
