Introduction
This document describes how to configure a Network File System (NFS) repository on Identity Services Engine (ISE).
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:
ISE 2.x.
basic shell commands
Components Used
ISE
Debian distribution (used Ubuntu here)
Configure
Step 1. Set Up NFS on ubuntu
You need first to install the nfs-kernel-server package on the ubuntu machine:
bara@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get update

bara@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server
Create a shared directory called nfs:
bara@ubuntu:~$ sudo mkdir /var/nfs/general -p
Change ownership to match nobody:nogroup
bara@ubuntu:~$ sudo chown nobody:nogroup /var/nfs/general
Configure the ISE as a client on the NFS, with the directory to be exported:
bara@ubuntu:~$ more /etc/exports

# directory_to_share    client(share_option1,...,share_optionN) 

# /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported

#               to NFS clients.  See exports(5).

#

# Example for NFSv2 and NFSv3:

# /srv/homes       hostname1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) hostname2(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)

#

# Example for NFSv4:

# /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)

# /srv/nfs4/homes  gss/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
Open /etc/export with nano:
bara@ubuntu:~$ sudo nano /etc/exports
Add the following two lines at the end (change the IP to ISE IP)
/var/nfs/general 10.48.85.249(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
/home 10.48.85.249(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)
Save and close (Ctrl+x, when asked to save press Y and enter) then restart the NFS server using below command:
bara@ubuntu:~$ sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
Step 2. ISE Configuration
Add the NFS repository to the ISE where /home/bara is the NFS mounting point
From the CLI:
ISE23S/admin(config)# repository NFS
ISE23S/admin(config-Repository)# url nfs://10.48.60.193:/home/bara
Note: Repositories configured from the CLI cannot be used from the ISE web UI and are not replicated to other ISE nodes.
From the GUI, go to Administration -> Maintenance -> Repository:
Note: NFS does not need username and password in this case, but since they are required in the form they must be added, any username and password can be entered.
Verify
List all files in the NFS repository.
ISE23S/admin# show repository NFS
ise-support-bundle-przaise001-a-hv11674-11-04-2019-08-25.tar.gpg
jcameron-key.asc
test.txt
On the NFS you can see the files:
bara@ubuntu:~$ pwd
/home/bara
bara@ubuntu:~$ ls
ise-support-bundle-przaise001-a-hv11674-11-04-2019-08-25.tar.gpg  jcameron-key.asc  test.txt
Known Defects
CSCvd73085:  Error mounting NFS location on ISE
CSCvk61086:  ISE 2.4 2.3 2.2 2.1 2.0 : NFS repository credentials are not used
CSCvk36814:  ISE 2.4 error mounting nfs repository
CSCvm41485:  ISE 2.3 : Unable to access NFS repository and scheduled reports not working using NFS repository
Troubleshoot
To debug the repository on ISE use following debugs:
#debug copy 7
#debug transfer 7
If #show rep NFS is failing, take captures and debugs, below is a screenshot of a working scenario:
Working
Below is a non-working scenario, it could be that ISE isnâ€™t listed in the /etc/exports
