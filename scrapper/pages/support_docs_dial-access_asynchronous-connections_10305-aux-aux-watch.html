Introduction
This document provides information about configuring dial-on-demand routing (DDR) backup for a serial, WAN, or leased line link using the dialer watch feature. The backup link uses modems on the AUX ports of both routers. When the primary link goes down, dialer watch initiates the backup dialout using the modem on the AUX Port.
Prerequisites
Requirements
This document assumes you have a good understanding of the various issues associated with modems on AUX ports. If you need more information on these issues, please refer to the documents Modem-Router Connection Guide and Configuring Dialout using a Modem on the AUX Port before continuing on with this document.
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
Two Cisco 2600s with US Robotics Modems connected to the AUX Ports. Both routers are running Cisco IOS® Software Release 12.1(2).
It is recommended that you use Cisco IOS version 12.1(7) or later, which includes fixes for IOS bugs that affect dialer watch.
The information presented in this document was created from devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If you are working in a live network, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command before using it.
Conventions
For more information on document conventions, refer to the Cisco Technical Tips Conventions.
Background Theory
This scenario involves configuring dialin and dialout using modems on the AUX ports, and configuring DDR backup with dialer watch. For more information on the dialer watch feature, refer to Evaluating Backup Interfaces, Floating Static Routes, and Dialer Watch for DDR Backup.
Refer to Configuring DDR Backup using BRIs and Dialer Watch for information on how to configure and troubleshoot dialer watch. The concepts involved for dialer watch are independent of the media used, so that document is useful for dialer watch issues.
Configure
In this section, you are presented with the information to configure the features described in this document.
Note: To find additional information on the commands used in this document, use the Command Lookup Tool (registered customers only) .
Network Diagram
This document uses the network setup shown in this diagram:
Configurations
In this configuration, maui-rtr-10 (Client) is connected by a serial link to maui-rtr-11 (Central Site). Both routers also have external US Robotics modems connected to the AUX Ports and used as backup. When the primary link goes down, dialer watch initiates the backup link and maui-rtr-10 dials the central site router, connects, negotiates PPP, and exchanges Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing information. All traffic between the routers now uses the backup connection. When the primary link is reestablished, the routing table is updated and all traffic once again uses the primary link. Since no traffic flows on the backup link, the idle timeout expires and dialer watch tears down the backup link.

This section provides information you can use to confirm your configuration works properly.
Certain show commands are supported by the Output Interpreter (registered customers only) tool, which allows you to view an analysis of show command output.
Sample show Output
The routing table of the client (maui-rtr-10) with the primary link functioning is shown here:
maui-rtr-10#show ip route
Codes: C - connected, S - static, I - IGRP, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP
       D - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter area 
       N1 - OSPF NSSA external type 1, N2 - OSPF NSSA external type 2
       E1 - OSPF external type 1, E2 - OSPF external type 2, E - EGP
       i - IS-IS, L1 - IS-IS level-1, L2 - IS-IS level-2, ia - IS-IS inter area

       P - periodic downloaded static route

C       192.168.10.1/32 is directly connected, Serial0/1
     172.17.0.0/24 is subnetted, 1 subnets
C       172.17.1.0 is directly connected, Loopback0
     172.16.0.0/24 is subnetted, 1 subnets
C       172.16.1.0 is directly connected, Ethernet0/0
     172.22.0.0/16 is variably subnetted, 2 subnets, 2 masks
O       172.22.53.0/24 [110/65] via 192.168.10.1, 00:00:57, Serial0/1
O       172.22.1.1/32 [110/65] via 192.168.10.1, 00:00:59, Serial0/1
The show ip route command output shown above displays the OSPF routes learned from the peers using the primary link (serial 0/1). Notice that the route being watched (172.22.53.0 with mask 255.255.255.0) exists in the routing table. This must be verified for dialer watch to function correctly.
Now the primary link is brought down and dialer watch activates the backup link.
After the backup link is activated, the OSPF table is exchanged and the new route using the backup link is installed. Traffic now passes across the backup link. An example of this is shown here:
maui-rtr-10#show ip route
Codes: C - connected, S - static, I - IGRP, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP
       D - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter area 
       N1 - OSPF NSSA external type 1, N2 - OSPF NSSA external type 2
       E1 - OSPF external type 1, E2 - OSPF external type 2, E - EGP
       i - IS-IS, L1 - IS-IS level-1, L2 - IS-IS level-2, ia - IS-IS inter area
       * - candidate default, U - per-user static route, o - ODR
       P - periodic downloaded static route

Gateway of last resort is not set

     172.17.0.0/24 is subnetted, 1 subnets
C       172.17.1.0 is directly connected, Loopback0
     172.16.0.0/24 is subnetted, 1 subnets
C       172.16.1.0 is directly connected, Ethernet0/0
     172.22.0.0/16 is variably subnetted, 2 subnets, 2 masks
O       172.22.53.0/24 [110/870] via 172.22.1.1, 00:00:11, Async65
C       172.22.1.1/32 is directly connected, Async65
The output above shows that the routing table has been updated and all traffic for the watched network now uses the backup link (Async 65).
Troubleshoot
This section provides information you can use to troubleshoot your configuration.
Troubleshooting Commands
Certain show commands are supported by the Output Interpreter (registered customers only) tool, which allows you to view an analysis of show command output.
Note: Before you issue debug commands, refer to Important Information on Debug Commands.
debug dialer—To display debugging information about the packets received on a dialer interface. When DDR is enabled on the interface, information concerning the cause of any call (called the Dialing cause) is also displayed. For more information, see the debug dialer information in the Debug Commands documentation.
debug modem—To display the modem line activity, modem control and process activation messages on the router.
debug chat—To monitor the execution of the chat script when async/POTS dialing is initiated. Refer to Dialup Technology: Troubleshooting Techniques for more information.
debug ppp negotiation—Displays information on PPP traffic and exchanges while negotiating the PPP components including Link Control Protocol (LCP), Authentication, and Network Control Protocol (NCP). A successful PPP negotiation first opens the LCP state, then Authenticates, and finally negotiates NCP.
debug ppp authentication—Displays the PPP authentication protocol messages, including Challenge Authentication Protocol (CHAP) packet exchanges and Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) exchanges
Sample Debug Output
The debug output below shows the primary link failing and dialer watch recognizing the lost route. The router then initiates the backup link. After the dialer idle-timeout expires, the router checks whether the primary link is down. When the primary link is reestablished, dialer watch disconnects the backup link after the disable timer expires. When looking at the debugs, pay attention to the timestamp in each message as they can provide information on the various timers and idle timeouts that are active.
