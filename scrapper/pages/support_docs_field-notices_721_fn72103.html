Problem Description
For affected versions of the Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower eXtensible Operating System (FXOS), and Firepower software, some Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates issued from the QuoVadis root certificate authority (CA) trust chain before March 31, 2021 cannot be renewed from this CA. Once those certificates expire on devices or are removed from the Cisco cloud servers, functions such as Smart Licensing and Smart Call Home will fail to establish secure connections to Cisco and might not operate properly.
Background
The QuoVadis Root CA 2 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) used by ASA, FXOS, and Firepower software to issue SSL certificates is subject to an industry-wide issue that affects revocation abilities. Due to this issue, no new QuoVadis Root CA 2 certificates will be issued or renewed by Cisco after March 31, 2021. This affects certificate renewals on devices, Cisco cloud servers, and third-party services.
Certificates issued before the QuoVadis Root CA 2 was decommissioned will continue to be valid. However, the certificates will not renew when they expire on either the device or the Cisco cloud server. This will cause functions such as Smart Licensing and Smart Call Home to fail to establish secure connections to Cisco cloud servers.
This table shows a summary of the QuoVadis Root CA 2 certificate expiration dates for affected Cisco services.
Cisco Cloud Server QuoVadis Certificate Expiration Date Affected Services
tools.cisco.com February 5, 2022
Smart Licensing using FMC
Smart Call Home

Applies to ASA, FXOS, FMC, and FDM for Firepower 6.5 and earlier
smartreceiver.cisco.com January 26, 2023
Smart Licensing using Firepower Device Manager (FDM)

Applies to FDM for Firepower 6.6 and later
Security Services Exchange (SSE) NAM March 22, 2023
May 5, 2022 for CSD feature only
SSE connectivity, messaging, and eventing for security cloud services
Eventing for Security Analytics and Logging (SAL) and SecureX
Cisco Support Diagnostics (CSD) used by the Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to upload diagnostics
Access to FDM using Cisco Defense Orchestrator (CDO)
Low Touch Provisioning (LTP)
Ribbon integration for SecureX
SSE EU March 22, 2023
May 5, 2022 for CSD feature only
SSE APJ March 16, 2023
May 5, 2022 for CSD feature only
  Note: The Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) services are not affected by the QuoVadis certificate expiration.
Problem Symptom
Expiration of the QuoVadis Root CA 2 certificates affects these services with the associated symptoms.
Affected Services Symptoms for Affected Services
Smart Licensing Failure to connect to the server (Details are provided in this section)
Smart Call Home Failure to connect to the server and the Call-Home HTTP request fails

Note: Smart Call Home is the carrier for Smart Licensing and other telemetry data communication.
SSE connectivity, messaging, and eventing for security cloud services SSE connectivity, enrollment, and messaging will fail
Eventing for Security Analytics and Logging (SAL) and SecureX Events for SAL and SecureX will fail
Cisco Support Diagnostics (CSD) used by TAC to upload diagnostics Uploads to CSD will fail
Access to FDM using Cisco Defense Orchestrator (CDO) Onboarding new devices will fail, existing devices will not be able to provide status or deploy configurations
Low Touch Provisioning (LTP) Onboarding of devices in CDO will fail
Ribbon integration for SecureX Onboarding of the SecureX ribbon in FMC will fail, but the browser flow will be unaffected
  For Firepower devices, affected devices will be unable to connect to the Smart Licensing and Smart Call Home services hosted by Cisco. Smart licenses might fail entitlement and reflect an Out of Compliance status.
The features that use Smart Licensing will continue to function for one year after the last successful secure connection. Some Smart Licensing symptoms are:
The device might indicate a failure to communicate with the Smart Licensing server within 30 days from the last successful connection.
The device will show the "Authorization Expired" state if there is no communication with the Smart Licensing server within 90 days.
The device will show the "Unregistered" state if there is no communication with the Smart Licensing server after one year and the licensed features usage become suspended.
Offline licensing, such as Permanent License Reservation (PLR) and Specific License Reservation (SLR), is not affected by the certificate change on the Smart Licensing server.
For additional information, refer to the Cisco Smart Licensing Guide.
  ASA - Problem Symptoms
For ASA-based devices, enter the show license registration command in order to view the licensing status. Affected ASA security chassis will show "Communication message send response error" in the output.

Smart Licensing Status
======================

Smart Licensing is ENABLED

Registration:

  Status: REGISTERING - REGISTRATION IN PROGRESS
  Export-Controlled Functionality: Not Allowed
  Initial Registration: FAILED on Oct 09 18:03:27 2018 UTC
    Failure reason: Failed to authenticate server
  Next Registration Attempt: Oct 09 18:18:39 2018 UTC
  FMC - Problem Symptoms
For Firepower-based devices managed by the FMC, the management console will show this message if there is no connection to the Smart Licensing server.
  FDM - Problem Symptoms
For Firepower-based devices managed by the FDM that have already been Smart Licensed, there might not be any observable problem symptoms. For devices not previously Smart Licensed, attempts to license the device might fail with a communication error.
Workaround/Solution
Cisco has migrated from the QuoVadis Root CA 2 to the IdenTrust Commercial Root CA 1 for SSL certificates. Cisco recommends these two options to add the new IdenTrust Commercial Root CA 1 certificate to the ASA, FXOS, and Firepower software.

  Firepower - Software Upgrade
For Firepower-based devices, upgrade to one of the Firepower software versions shown in the table and run the additional commands in order to resolve the root CA certificate issue for affected devices.
Release Version Fixed Version
Firepower 6.1.x Migrate to a fixed release
Firepower 6.2.x Firepower 6.2.3.18 or later
Firepower 6.3.x Migrate to a fixed release
Firepower 6.4.x Firepower 6.4.0.13 or later
Firepower 6.5.x Migrate to a fixed release
Firepower 6.6.x Firepower 6.6.5 or later
Firepower 6.7.x Firepower 6.7.0.3 or later
Note: An update to Firepower 7.0 or later will resolve the field notice issue and requires no additional manual steps.
For Firepower 6.7 or earlier, after you upgrade the FMC to a fixed version, remove the certificate file at /etc/sf/gch/call_home_ca and restart the Smart Licensing Agent (sla) process to resume communications with Cisco Smart Software Manager (CSSM) with these steps:
Access the CLI. For FMC deployments, log in to the FMC CLI as admin or another user with shell access.
Enter the expert command in order to access the Linux shell.
Elevate the user to root with the sudo su – command and enter the password when prompted.
Remove the /etc/sf/gch/call_home_ca file with the rm /etc/sf/gch/call_home_ca command.
Restart the Smart Licensing Agreement process with the pmtool restartbyid sla command.
  Firepower - Manual Certificate Update
For devices managed by FMC, the issue can be resolved for the Smart Licensing service only without an upgrade to the Firepower software. For services other than Smart Licensing, a software upgrade is required to fix the issue.
Complete these steps in order to manually import the IdenTrust Commercial Root CA 1 certificate. Do not use this workaround when you use Common Criteria (CC) Mode or for devices managed by Firepower Device Manager (FDM). Instead, upgrade to one of the Firepower software versions provided in the table.
Enter sudo su - in order to elevate to root.
Enter mv /etc/sf/gch/call_home_ca /etc/sf/gch/call_home_ca.bak in order to back up the current certificate.
Create a new certificate file.
Enter vim /etc/sf/gch/call_home_ca.
Press the i key in order to enter editing mode.
Copy and paste this IdenTrust Commercial Root CA 1 certificate into the file.
