Solution Overview
Introduction
Cisco UCS Integrated Infrastructure provides a pre-validated, ready-to-deploy infrastructure, which reduces the time and complexity involved in configuring and validating a traditional data center deployment. Cisco UCS Platforms is flexible, reliable and cost effective to facilitate various deployment options of the applications while being easily scalable and manageable. The reference architecture detailed in this document highlights the resiliency, cost benefit, and ease of deployment of a SAP HANA solution. This document describing the infrastructure installation and configuration to run SAP HANA on a dedicated or shared infrastructure.
SAP HANA is SAP SE’s implementation of in-memory database technology. The SAP HANA database takes advantage of the low cost main memory (RAM), data-processing capabilities of multicore processors, and faster data access to provide better performance for analytical and transactional applications. SAP HANA offers a multi-engine, query-processing environment that supports relational data (with both row- and column-oriented physical representations in a hybrid engine) as well as a graph and text processing for semi-structured and unstructured data management within the same system. As an appliance, SAP HANA combines software components from SAP optimized for certified hardware. However, this solution has a preconfigured hardware set-up and preinstalled software package that is dedicated for SAP HANA. In 2013, SAP introduced SAP HANA Tailored Datacenter Integration (TDI) option; TDI solution offers a more open and flexible way for integrating SAP HANA into the data center by reusing existing enterprise storage hardware, thereby reducing hardware costs. With the introduction of SAP HANA TDI for shared infrastructure, the Cisco UCS Integrated Infrastructure solution provides the advantage of having the compute, storage, and network stack integrated with the programmability of the Cisco Unified Computing System (Cisco UCS). SAP HANA TDI option enables organizations to run multiple SAP HANA production systems on a shared infrastructure. It also enables customers to run the SAP applications servers and SAP HANA database hosted on the same infrastructure.

Technology Overview
Cisco Unified Computing System
The Cisco Unified Computing System is a state-of-the-art data center platform that unites computing, network, storage access, and virtualization into a single cohesive system.
The main components of the Cisco Unified Computing System are:
·         Computing - The system is based on an entirely new class of computing system that incorporates rack mount and blade servers based on Intel Xeon Processor E5 and E7. The Cisco UCS Servers offer the patented Cisco Extended Memory Technology to support applications with large datasets and allow more virtual machines per server.
·         Network - The system is integrated onto a low-latency, lossless, 40-Gbps unified network fabric. This network foundation consolidates LANs, SANs, and high-performance computing networks which are separate networks today. The unified fabric lowers costs by reducing the number of network adapters, switches, and cables, and by decreasing the power and cooling requirements.
·         Virtualization - The system unleashes the full potential of virtualization by enhancing the scalability, performance, and operational control of virtual environments. Cisco security, policy enforcement, and diagnostic features are now extended into virtualized environments to better support changing business and IT requirements.
·         Storage access - The system provides consolidated access to both SAN storage and Network Attached Storage (NAS) over the unified fabric. By unifying the storage access, the Cisco Unified Computing System can access storage over Ethernet (NFS or iSCSI) and Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE). This provides customers with choice for storage access and investment protection. In addition, the server administrators can pre-assign storage-access policies for system connectivity to storage resources, simplifying storage connectivity, and management for increased productivity.
The Cisco Unified Computing System is designed to deliver:
·         A reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and increased business agility.
·         Increased IT staff productivity through just-in-time provisioning and mobility support.
·         A cohesive, integrated system, which unifies the technology in the data center.
·         Industry standards supported by a partner ecosystem of industry leaders.

Cisco UCS Differentiators
Cisco’s Unified Compute System is revolutionizing the way servers are managed in data-center. The following are the unique differentiators of Cisco Unified Computing System and Cisco UCS Manager:
·         Embedded management: In Cisco Unified Computing System, the servers are managed by the embedded firmware in the Fabric Interconnects, eliminating need for any external physical or virtual devices to manage the servers. Also, a pair of FIs can manage up to 40 chassis, each containing 8 blade servers. This gives enormous scaling on management plane.
·         Unified fabric: In Cisco Unified Computing System, from blade server chassis or rack server fabric extender to FI, there is a single Ethernet cable used for LAN, SAN and management traffic. This converged I/O, results in reduced cables, SFPs and adapters – reducing capital and operational expenses of overall solution.
·         Auto discovery: By simply inserting the blade server in the chassis or connecting rack server to the fabric extender, discovery and inventory of compute resource occurs automatically without any management intervention. Combination of unified fabric and auto-discovery enables wire-once architecture of Cisco Unified Computing System, where compute capability of Cisco Unified Computing System can extend easily, while keeping the existing external connectivity to LAN, SAN and management networks.
·         Policy based resource classification: When a compute resource is discovered by Cisco UCS Manager, it can be automatically classified to a given resource pool based on policies defined. This capability is useful in multi-tenant cloud computing. This CVD focuses on the policy-based resource classification of Cisco UCS Manager.
·         Combined Rack and Blade server management: Cisco UCS Manager can manage Cisco UCS B-Series Blade Servers and Cisco UCS C-Series Rack Servers under the same Cisco UCS domain. This feature, along with stateless computing makes compute resources truly hardware form factor agnostic. This CVD focuses on the combination of B-Series and C-Series Servers to demonstrate stateless and form factor independent computing work load.
·         Model-based management architecture: Cisco UCS Manager Architecture and management database is model based and data driven. Open, standard based XML API is provided to operate on the management model. This enables easy and scalable integration of Cisco UCS Manager with other management system, such as VMware vCloud director, Microsoft system center, and Citrix CloudPlatform.
·         Policies, Pools, Templates: Management approach in Cisco UCS Manager is based on defining policies, pools and templates, instead of cluttered configuration, which enables simple, loosely coupled, data driven approach in managing compute, network and storage resources.
·         Loose referential integrity: In Cisco UCS Manager, a service profile, port profile or policies can refer to other policies or logical resources with loose referential integrity. A referred policy cannot exist at the time of authoring the referring policy or a referred policy can be deleted even though other policies are referring to it. This provides different subject matter experts to work independently from each-other. This provides great flexibilities where different experts from different domains, such as network, storage, security, server and virtualization work together to accomplish a complex task.
·         Policy resolution: In Cisco UCS Manager, a tree structure of organizational unit hierarchy can be created that mimics the real life tenants and/or organization relationships. Various policies, pools and templates can be defined at different levels of organization hierarchy. A policy referring to other policy by name is resolved in the org hierarchy with closest policy match. If no policy with specific name is found in the hierarchy till root org, then special policy named “default” is searched. This policy resolution practice enables automation friendly management APIs and provides great flexibilities to owners of different orgs.
·         Service profiles and stateless computing: Service profile is a logical representation of a server, carrying its various identities and policies. This logical server can be assigned to any physical compute resource as far as it meets the resource requirements. Stateless computing enables procurement of a server within minutes, which used to take days in legacy server management systems.
·         Built-in multi-tenancy support: Combination of policies, pools and templates, loose referential integrity, policy resolution in org hierarchy and service profile based approach to compute resources make Cisco UCS Manager inherently friendly to multi-tenant environment typically observed in private and public clouds.
·         Virtualization aware network: VM-FEX technology makes access layer of network aware about host virtualization. This prevents domain pollution of compute and network domains with virtualization when virtual network is managed by port-profiles defined by the network administrators’ team. VM-FEX also offloads hypervisor CPU by performing switching in the hardware, thus allowing hypervisor CPU to do more virtualization related tasks. VM-FEX technology is well integrated with VMware vCenter, Linux KVM and Hyper-V SR-IOV to simplify cloud management.
·         Simplified QoS: Even though fibre-channel and Ethernet are converged in Cisco UCS fabric, built-in support for QoS and lossless Ethernet makes it seamless. Network Quality of Service (QoS) is simplified in Cisco UCS Manager by representing all system classes in one GUI panel.
MapR Converged Data Platform
The MapR Converged Data Platform integrates Hadoop and Spark, real-time database capabilities, and global event streaming with big data enterprise storage, for developing and running innovative data applications. The MapR Platform is powered by the industry’s fastest, most reliable, secure, and open data infrastructure that dramatically lowers TCO and enables global real-time data applications.
MapR Platform Services is the set of core capabilities in the MapR Converged Data Platform. Core components include:
·         MapR Streams - a global publish-subscribe event streaming system for big data
·         MapR-DB - a high performance, in-Hadoop NoSQL database management system
·         MapR-FS - the underlying POSIX file system that provides distributed, reliable, high performance, scalable, and full read/write data storage
The Cisco UCS C240 Appliance for SAP HANA takes advantage of the enterprise grade MapR-FS in MapR Platform Services. It offers the appliance a robust storage layer that is highly available, resilient and performant.
MapR converged data platform is backed by the robust MapR-FS, which can be accessed through the NFS gateway. The SAP HANA Servers mounts MapR-FS using NFS client. Data can be persisted to the storage system managed by MapR-FS. MapR-FS is distributed, has a global name space, real-time read/write access, volume based, secure and has many other benefits compared to HDFS.
Solution Design
This section describes the SAP HANA system requirements defined by SAP and Architecture of Cisco UCS Integrated Infrastructure for SAP HANA.
SAP HANA System
SAP HANA System on a Single Server Scale-Up, is the simplest of the installation types. It is possible to run an SAP HANA system entirely on one host and then scale the system up as needed. All data and processes are located on the same server and can be accessed locally. The network requirements for this option minimum one 1-Gb Ethernet (access) and one 10-Gb Ethernet storage networks are sufficient to run SAP HANA scale-up. SAP HANA Scale-Out option is used if the SAP HANA system does not fit into the main memory of a single server based on the rules defined by SAP. In this method, multiple independent servers are combined to form one system and the load is distributed among multiple servers. In a distributed system, each index server is usually assigned to its own host to achieve maximum performance. It is possible to assign different tables to different hosts (partitioning the database), or a single table can be split across hosts (partitioning of tables). SAP HANA Scale-Out supports failover scenarios and high availability. Individual hosts in a distributed system have different roles master, worker, slave, standby depending on the task.
          Some use cases are not supported on SAP HANA Scale-Out configuration and it is recommended to check with SAP whether a use case can be deployed as a Scale-Out solution.
The network requirements for this option are higher than for Scale-Up systems. In addition to the client and application access and storage access network, a node-to-node network is necessary. One 10 Gigabit Ethernet (access) and one 10 Gigabit Ethernet (node-to-node) and one 10 Gigabit Ethernet storage networks are required to run SAP HANA Scale-Out system. Additional network bandwidth is required to support system replication or backup capability.
Hardware Requirements for the SAP HANA Database
There are hardware and software requirements defined by SAP to run SAP HANA systems. This Cisco Validated Design uses guidelines provided by SAP.
For additional information, go to: http://saphana.com.
          This document does not cover the updated information published by SAP.
CPU
SAP HANA supports servers equipped with Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8176, 8176M, 8180 and 8180M CPU.
Memory
SAP HANA Scale-Out solution is supported in the following memory configurations:
·         Homogenous symmetric assembly of dual in-line memory modules (DIMMs) for example, DIMM size or speed should not be mixed
·         Maximum use of all available memory channels
·         Memory of 1.5 TB or 3 TB per 4 Socket Server for SAP NetWeaver Business Warehouse (BW) and DataMart
Network
A SAP HANA data center deployment can range from a database running on a single host to a complex distributed system. Distributed systems can get complex with multiple hosts located at a primary site having one or more secondary sites; supporting a distributed multi-terabyte database with full fault and disaster recovery.
SAP HANA has different types of network communication channels to support the different SAP HANA scenarios and setups:
·         Client zone: Channels used for external access to SAP HANA functions by end-user clients, administration clients, and application servers, and for data provisioning through SQL or HTTP
·         Internal zone: Channels used for SAP HANA internal communication within the database or, in a distributed scenario, for communication between hosts
·         Storage zone: Channels used for storage access (data persistence) and for backup and restore procedures

For detailed information about the network requirements for SAP HANA see: SAP HANA Network Requirements.
The network need to be properly segmented and must be connected to the same core/ backbone switch as shown in Figure 13 based on customer’s high-availability and redundancy requirements for different SAP HANA network segments.

  Figure 13        High-Level SAP HANA Network Overview
Based on the listed network requirements, every server must be equipped with 2x 10 Gigabit Ethernet for scale-up systems to establish the communication with the application or user (Client Zone) and a 10 GbE Interface for Storage access.
For scale-out solutions an additional redundant network for SAP HANA node to node communication with 10 GbE is required (Internal Zone).
          For more information on SAP HANA Network security please refer to the SAP HANA Security Guide.
Storage
As an in-memory database, SAP HANA uses storage devices to save a copy of the data, for the purpose of startup and fault recovery without data loss. The choice of the specific storage technology is driven by various requirements like size, performance and high availability. To use the storage system in the Tailored Datacenter Integration option, the storage must be certified for the SAP HANA TDI option at: http://scn.sap.com/docs/DOC-48516.
All relevant information about storage requirements is documented in the white paper SAP HANA Storage Requirements.
          SAP can only support performance related SAP HANA topics if the installed solution has passed the validation test successfully.
Refer to SAP HANA Administration Guide section 2.8 Hardware Checks for Tailored Datacenter Integration for Hardware check test tool and the related documentation.
Filesystem Layout
Figure 14 shows the file system layout and the required storage sizes to install and operate SAP HANA. For the Linux OS installation (/root) 10 GB of disk size is recommended. Additionally, 50 GB must be provided for the /usr/sap since the volume used for SAP software that supports SAP HANA.
While installing SAP HANA on a host, we specify the mount point for the installation binaries (/hana/shared/<sid>), data files (/hana/data/<sid>) and log files (/hana/log/<sid>), where sid is the instance identifier of the SAP HANA installation.
Figure 14       File System Layout for 2 Node Scale-Out System
The storage sizing for filesystem is based on the amount of memory equipped on the SAP HANA host.
In case of distributed installation of SAP HANA Scale-Out, each server will have the following:
Root-FS: 10 GB
/usr/sap: 50 GB
The installation binaries, trace and configuration files are stored on a shared filesystem, which should be accessible for all hosts in the distributed installation. The size of shared filesystem should be equal to one times memory in each host for every four worker nodes. For example: In a distributed installation with eight hosts with 2 TB of memory each, shared file system should be 4 TB.
For each HANA host there should be a mount point for data and log volume.
Size of the file system for data volume for Appliance option is three times the host memory:
/hana/data/<sid>/mntXXXXX: 3 x Memory
Size of the file system for data volume with TDI option is one times the host memory:
/hana/data/<sid>/mntXXXXX: 1 x Memory
The Log volume must be as follows:
·         Half of the server memory for systems ≤ 256 GB memory
·         Min 512 GB for systems with ≥ 512 GB memory
Operating System
The supported operating systems for SAP HANA are as follows:
·         SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications
·         RedHat Enterprise Linux for SAP HANA
          This document provides the installation process for the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications only. For RedHat Enterprise Linux option, please review the Cisco Validated Design, Cisco UCS II for SAP HANA with RHEL.
High Availability
The infrastructure for a SAP HANA solution must not have single point of failure. To support high-availability, the hardware and software requirements are:
·         Internal storage: A RAID-based configuration is preferred
·         External storage: Redundant data paths, dual controllers, and a RAID-based configuration are required
·         Ethernet switches: Two or more independent switches should be used
SAP HANA Scale-Out comes with in integrated high-availability function. If a SAP HANA system is configured with a stand-by node, a failed part of SAP HANA will start on the stand-by node automatically. For automatic host failover, storage connector API must be properly configured for the implementation and operation of the SAP HANA.
Please check the latest information from SAP at: http://saphana.com or http://service.sap.com/notes.
Physical Topology
The Cisco UCS Integrated Infrastructure for SAP HANA with MapR Converged Data Platform provides an end-to-end architecture with Cisco Hardware that demonstrate support for multiple SAP HANA workloads with high availability and server redundancy. The architecture uses Cisco UCS Manager with combined Cisco UCS B-Series and C-Series Servers with Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect. The uplink from Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect is connected to Nexus 3524 switches for High Availability and Failover functionality. The Cisco UCS C-Series Rack Servers are connected directly to Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect with single-wire management feature, the data traffic between HANA servers and Storage will be contained in the Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect. This infrastructure is deployed to provide IP based Storage access using NFS protocols with file-level access to shared storage.
Considerations
Scale
Although this is the base design, each of the components can be scaled easily to support specific business requirements. Additional servers or even blade chassis can be deployed to increase compute capacity without additional Network components. Two Cisco UCS 6332UP, 32 port Fabric interconnect can support up to:
·         16 Cisco UCS B-Series B460 M4 Server with 8 Blade Server Chassis
·         8 Cisco UCS C240 M4 Server
Minimum of 3 x UCS C240 M4 Servers are required to install MapR Converged Data Platform with High Availability. 3 x Cisco UCS C240 M4 can support up to 6 Active HANA Servers. The scaling of storage to computer node is linear, for every 2 x Cisco UCS Server for HANA, 1 x Cisco UCS C240 M4 for Storage is required to meet the SAP HANA storage performance defined by SAP SE.
Performance
The solution is designed to meet SAP HANA performance requirement defined by SAP SE. The HANA Server and Storage server are connecting to Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect, all the data traffic between HANA node and Storage node is contained in the Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect. Each HANA Server and Storage Server are equipped with 2 x 40GbE capable Cisco Virtual Interface Cards, the storage network provides dedicated bandwidth between HANA servers and Storage Servers. The traffic shaping and Quality of Service (QoS) is configured and managed by Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect. For HANA node-to-node network, 40 Gb dedicated network bandwidth is provided with non-blocking mode. The Cisco UCS Integrated Infrastructure for SAP HANA quarantines the bandwidth and latency for best performance to run SAP HANA.

1.     To configure the network interface on the OS, it is required to identify the mapping of the ethernet device on the OS to vNIC interface on the Cisco UCS.
2.     From the OS, execute the following command to get list of Ethernet device with MAC Address:
ifconfig -a|grep HWaddr
eth0 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 00:25:B5:2A:00:2C
eth1 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 00:25:B5:2B:00:28
eth2 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 00:25:B5:2B:00:29
eth3 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 00:25:B5:2A:00:2E
3.     In Cisco UCS Manager, click the Servers tab in the navigation pane.
4.     Expand Servers > Service Profile > root > Sub-Organization > HANA > MapR-01.
5.     Click + to Expand. Click vNICs.

7.     Note the MAC Address of the MapR-01 vNIC is “00:25:B5:2A:00:2C”.
8.     By comparing the MAC Address on the OS and Cisco UCS, eth0 on OS will carry the VLAN for MapR-01.
9.     Go to the network configuration directory and create a configuration for eth0:
/etc/sysconfig/network/
vi ifcfg-eth0
##
# Mapr-01 Network
##
BOOTPROTO='static'
BROADCAST=''
ETHTOOL_OPTIONS=''
IPADDR='<<IP address for MapR-01 example:10.21.21.101/24>>'
MTU='9000'
NAME='VIC Ethernet NIC'
NETWORK=''
REMOTE_IPADDR=''
STARTMODE='auto'
10.  Repeat the steps 1 to 9 for each vNIC interface.
11.  Add default gateway:
vi etc/sysconfig/network/routes
default 192.168.196.1 - -
DNS
Domain Name Service configuration must be done based on the local requirements.
Configuration Example
Add DNS IP if it is required to access internet:
vi /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver <<IP of DNS Server1>>
nameserver <<IP of DNS Server2>>
search <<Domain_name>>
Hosts
All nodes should be able to resolve internal network IP address, below is an example of 4 node host file with the entire network defined in the /etc/hosts file.

Network Time
The configuration of NTP is important and must be performed on all systems. To configure network time, complete the following step:
1.     Configure NTP by adding at least one NTP server to the NTP config file /etc/ntp.conf:
vi /etc/ntp.conf
server <NTP-SERVER IP>
fudge <NTP-SERVER IP> stratum 10
keys /etc/ntp.keys
trustedkey 1
SSH Keys
The SSH Keys must be exchanged between all MapR servers for user ‘root’. To exchange the SSH keys, complete the following steps:
1.     Generate the rsa public key by executing the following command:
ssh-keygen -b 2048
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
62:8a:0b:c4:4c:d7:de:8d:dc:e7:b7:17:ca:c7:02:94 root@mapr21.ciscolab.local
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
| |
| . |
| . . . . |
|+ . . o + E |
| + .o+So.. |
|. . o . o. . |
|. . . .o.o .|
| . . .+.+ |
| . .+ |
+-----------------+
2.     Exchange the rsa public key by executing the below command from First server to rest of the servers. This helps ensure that every host can establish a password-less ssh connection to every other host:
“ssh-copy-id -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub mapr31”
ssh-copy-id -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub mapr32
3.     Repeat the steps above for all the servers in the MapR cluster.
MapR Installation
The installation of the MapR software needs a repository with the MapR software packages. If the MapR cluster nodes have internet access, it is recommended to prepare an online repository. If the MapR cluster nodes do not have internet access, you can download the packages from a computer which has internet access, unzip and copy them to a server which is reachable by the MapR cluster nodes or to a MapR cluster node itself and prepare an offline repository.
          The following information is required to setup the MapR Cluster.
Cluster IDs
Cluster Name:                example: mapr500
Virtual IP Range
For High Availability and network bandwidth distribution, virtual IPs are created on the MapR cluster. These virtual IPs are bind to HANA Storage Ethernet device. HANA servers will use these virtual IPs to mount the NFS volumes. If a MapR node is failed, the virtual IPs are moved to other active nodes and the HANA servers will continue to access NFS volumes without any disruption. Its recommended to create two virtual IP address per MapR server, for example if there are 4 MapR nodes in the cluster – Create 8 Virtual IPs.
IP Address:                example: 192.168.110.101-108
Subnet Mask:             example: 255.255.255.0 or /24
Preparing Online Repository
On every MapR cluster node, to add the MapR repository, complete the following steps:
1.     Use the following command to add the repository for MapR packages:
zypper ar http://package.mapr.com/releases/v5.2.0/suse/ maprtech
2.     If your connection to the Internet is through a proxy server, you must set the http_proxy environment variable before installation:
http_proxy=http://<host>:<port>
export http_proxy
3.     Update the system package index by running the following command:
zypper refresh
4.     MapR packages require a compatibility package in order to install and run on SUSE. Execute the following command to install the SUSE compatibility package:
zypper install mapr-compat-suse
Installing MapR Packages
Packages are installed based on the role of the node. To install the MapR packages, complete the following steps:
1.     Install on MapR NFS and MapR Fileserver on all nodes in the MapR Cluster:
zypper in mapr-nfs mapr-fileserver
2.     Install zookeeper service on last three nodes of the MapR Cluster:
zypper in mapr-zookeeper
3.     Install cldb service on first two nodes of the MapR Cluster:
zypper in mapr-cldb
4.     Install webserver service on all the nodes or at least on two nodes in the MapR Cluster:
zypper in mapr-webserver
Initial Configuration
After all packages are installed, follow the steps below to configure MapR cluster.
          WARNING! Any changes after these steps without re-running the configuration script might result in an unstable cluster state.
1.     Increase memory usage of MapR instance:
sed -i
's/service.command.mfs.heapsize.percent=.*/service.command.mfs.heapsize.percent=8
5/g' /opt/mapr/conf/warden.conf
2.     Define the MapR subnets to use:
sed -i 's%s#export MAPR_SUBNETS=%export
MAPR_SUBNETS=<<internal_network_01>>/<<subnet_short>>,<<internal_network_02>>/<<s
ubnet_short>> %g' /opt/mapr/conf/env.sh
Example:
sed -i -e 's%#export MAPR_SUBNETS=%export
MAPR_SUBNETS=10.21.221.0/24,10.22.222.0/24 %g' /opt/mapr/conf/env.sh
3.     Modify the DrCache size of the NFS server:
sed -i 's/#DrCacheSize =.*/DrCacheSize = 614400/g' /opt/mapr/conf/nfsserver.conf
4.     Create the /mapr directory and the /opt/mapr/conf/mapr_fstab file:
mkdir -p /mapr
echo "localhost:/mapr /mapr hard,nolock" > /opt/mapr/conf/mapr_fstab
5.     Run the configuration script. -C followed by the cldb nodes, -Z followed by the zookeeper nodes, -N gives the cluster name, and -no-autostart hinders the MapR software to start automatically. If you use hostnames instead of IP addresses for -C and -Z, be sure to use hostnames which reflect to the internal cluster network IP addresses.
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -C <<cldbnode1>>,<<cldbnode2>> -Z
<<zookeepernode1>>,<<zookeepernode2>>,<<zookeepernode3>> -N <<clustername>> -noautostart
Example:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -C mapr31, mapr32 -Z mapr32,mapr33,mapr34 -N
mapr600 -no-autostart
6.     Create a file with a disk list, containing all Virtual Drives in RAID 5 created:
lsblk | grep 8.2T | awk '{print "/dev/"$1}' > /tmp/disk.list
7.     Set up the disks in the disk.list file with a storage pool of 1 disk each on all nodes:
          WARNING! The disks will be wiped immediately!
/opt/mapr/server/disksetup -W 1 -F /tmp/disk.list
8.     Repeat Step 1 through 7 on each MapR node in the cluster.
Starting up MapR cluster
To issue the following commands to start the cluster, complete the following steps:
1.     On zookeeper nodes:
service mapr-zookeeper start
2.     On all nodes, including zookeeper nodes:
service mapr-warden start
3.     Wait for about 5 minutes for the cluster to come up.
Add License to MapR Cluster
To add a license to the MapR Cluster, complete the following steps:
1.     When MapR Cluster is installed and running, log in to any MapR cluster node and retrieve your unique MapR cluster ID:
maprcli license showid
2.     Send the cluster ID and the number of MapR nodes, along with <customer info> to <MapR> to get your MapR License.
3.     If your cluster has internet access, install your license directly from the MapR License Server. Select Admin from the drop-down list and select Cluster Setting. In the Admin/ Cluster Setting click License.
4.     Select Import License, enter the credentials for mapr.com Account to retrieve the license.
5.     Alternatively, if your cluster does not have internet access, you can copy your license file to any MapR cluster node, and install it via the command line interface:
maprcli license add -is_file true -license <license_file>
          The MapR license file is a text file starting with the line "-----BEGIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----" and ending with the line "-- ---END MESSAGE HASH-----". You can also use "Add licenses via upload" or "Add licenses via copy/paste" in the "Manage Licenses" dialog in the MapR Control System GUI to install the license from a file.
Create Virtual IPs
In order to create virtual IP addresses for the MapR NFS server, MAC address of HANA-Storage vNIC on all the MapR nodes, IP address range for Virtual IP and Network subnet are required.
From each MapR Server execute ifconfig –a|grep HWaddr command to get list of Ethernet device with MAC Address. By comparing MAC Address on the OS and Cisco UCS Service Profile, eth2 on OS will carry the VLAN for HANA-Storage.
ifconfig -a |grep HWaddr
eth0 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 00:25:B5:2A:00:2C
eth1 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 00:25:B5:2B:00:28
eth2 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 00:25:B5:2B:00:29
eth3 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 00:25:B5:2A:00:2E
Below is the command to create Virtual IP on the MapR cluster:
maprcli virtualip add -macs <mac_addr_node1> <mac_addr_node2> <mac_addr_nodeN> -
virtualipend <<last_virtual_ip>> -netmask <<subnet_mask> -virtualip
<<first_virtual_ip>>
Example:
maprcli virtualip add -macs 00:25:b5:fb:00:29 00:25:b5:fb:00:22 00:25:b5:fb:00:24
00:25:b5:fb:00:26 -virtualipend 192.168.110.78 -netmask 255.255.255.0 -virtualip
192.168.110.71
Create Volumes
The MapR cluster needs an internal directory structure for its volumes. It is recommended to store the volumes in the /apps folder of the MapR cluster directory structure. The MapR file system is mounted on the MapR cluster nodes under /mapr, so the following directory structure should be created on one of the MapR cluster node.
1.     Confirm MapR file system is mounted at /mapr:
mount | grep mapr
localhost:/mapr on /mapr type nfs (rw,nolock,addr=127.0.0.1)
2.     Create HANA directory:
mkdir -p /mapr/<clustername>/apps/hana/<SID>
Example:
mkdir -p /mapr/mapr600/apps/hana/ANA
          When creating a volume, the volume name can differ from the directory name of MapR internal file system.
3.     Create volume for /hana/shared:
maprcli volume create -name <volumename> -path /apps/hana/<SID>/<volumename> -
replicationtype high_throughput -replication 2 -minreplication 2
4.     Create volumes for /hana/data for every single storage partition:
maprcli volume create -name <volumename> -path
/apps/hana/<SID>/<datamountpoint_storage_partition> -replicationtype
high_throughput -replication 2 -minreplication 2
5.     Create volumes for /hana/log for every single storage partition:
maprcli volume create -name <volumename> -path
/apps/hana/<SID>/<logmountpoint_storage_partition> -replicationtype low_latency -
replication 2 -minreplication 2
6.     Turn off the compression for log volumes:
hadoop mfs -setcompression off /mapr/<clustername>/apps/hana/<SID>/<volumename>
          It is recommended to reflect the SID in the path. For the three different volume types shared, data and log.
7.     Example for creating a volume for /hana/shared for SID "ANA":
maprcli volume create -name shared -path /apps/hana/ANA/shared -replicationtype
high_throughput -replication 2 -minreplication 2
8.     Example for creating eight volumes for /hana/data for SID "ANA":
maprcli volume create -name data001 -path /apps/hana/ANA/data001 -replicationtype
high_throughput -replication 2 -minreplication 2
maprcli volume create -name data002 -path /apps/hana/ANA/data002 -replicationtype
high_throughput -replication 2 -minreplication 2
maprcli volume create -name data003 -path /apps/hana/ANA/data003 -replicationtype
high_throughput -replication 2 -minreplication 2
maprcli volume create -name data004 -path /apps/hana/ANA/data004 -replicationtype
high_throughput -replication 2 -minreplication 2
maprcli volume create -name data005 -path /apps/hana/ANA/data005 -replicationtype
high_throughput -replication 2 -minreplication 2
maprcli volume create -name data006 -path /apps/hana/ANA/data006 -replicationtype
high_throughput -replication 2 -minreplication 2
maprcli volume create -name data007 -path /apps/hana/ANA/data007 -replicationtype
high_throughput -replication 2 -minreplication 2
maprcli volume create -name data008 -path /apps/hana/ANA/data008 -replicationtype
high_throughput -replication 2 -minreplication 2
9.     Example for creating eight volumes for /hana/log for SID "ANA":
maprcli volume create -name log001 -path /apps/hana/ANA/log001 -replicationtype
low_latency -replication 2 -minreplication 2
maprcli volume create -name log002 -path /apps/hana/ANA/log002 -replicationtype
low_latency -replication 2 -minreplication 2
maprcli volume create -name log003 -path /apps/hana/ANA/log003 -replicationtype
low_latency -replication 2 -minreplication 2
maprcli volume create -name log004 -path /apps/hana/ANA/log004 -replicationtype
low_latency -replication 2 -minreplication 2
maprcli volume create -name log005 -path /apps/hana/ANA/log005 -replicationtype
low_latency -replication 2 -minreplication 2
maprcli volume create -name log006 -path /apps/hana/ANA/log006 -replicationtype
low_latency -replication 2 -minreplication 2
maprcli volume create -name log007 -path /apps/hana/ANA/log007 -replicationtype
low_latency -replication 2 -minreplication 2
maprcli volume create -name log008 -path /apps/hana/ANA/log008 -replicationtype
low_latency -replication 2 -minreplication 2
10.  Example to turn off compression on eight log volumes for SID "ANA":
hadoop mfs -setcompression off /mapr/mapr600/apps/hana/ANA/log001

Network Time
It is important that the time on all components used for SAP HANA is in sync. The configuration of NTP is important and to be performed on all systems.
1.     Configure NTP by adding at least one NTP server to the NTP config file /etc/ntp.conf:
vi /etc/ntp.conf
server <NTP-SERVER IP>
fudge <NTP-SERVER IP> stratum 10
keys /etc/ntp.keys
trustedkey 1
SSH Keys
The SSH Keys must be exchanged between all nodes in a SAP HANA Scale-Out system for user ‘root’ and user <SID>adm.
1.     Generate the rsa public key by executing the command:
ssh-keygen -b 2048
2.     The SSH Keys must be exchanged between all nodes in a SAP HANA Scale-Out system for user ‘root’ and user.
3.     Exchange the rsa public key by executing the following command from the first server to rest of the servers in the scale-out system.
ssh-copy-id -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub cishanaso12
4.     Repeat the 1- 3 for all the servers in the SAP HANA system.
Mount Options
Mount options vary from the default Linux setting for using NFS for SAP HANA data and log volumes. The following is an example of /etc/fstab entry for an eight node SAP HANA Scale-Out system with SID ANA.

High Availability (HA) Configuration for Scale-Out
For HANA Scale-Out, the ha_provider python class supports the STONITH functionality.
STONITH = Shoot the Other Node In The Head. With this python class, we are able to reboot the failing node to prevent a split brain and thus an inconsistency of the database. Since we use NFSv3, we must implement the STONITH functionality to prevent the database from a corruption because of multiple access to mounted file systems. If a HANA node is failed over to another node, the failed node will be rebooted from the master name server. This eliminates the risk of multiple accesses to the same file systems.
High Availability Configuration
The used version of the ucs_ha_class.py must be at least 1.1

Enable the SAP HANA Storage Connector API
The SAP Storage Connector API provides a way to call a user procedure whenever the SAP HANA Nameserver triggers a node failover. The API requires the files mentioned above.
The procedure is executed on the master nameserver.
To activate the procedure in case of a node failover, the global.ini file in:
<HANA installdirectory>/<SID>/global/hdb/custom/config/
must be edited and the following entry must be added:
