Introduction
This document describes how to check the compatibility of the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) with your Network Access Device (NAD).
ISE Supports the RADIUS and TACACS Protocols
If your network device can issue access control requests using the standard RADIUS and TACACS protocols then ISE can support it!
ISE supports RADIUS to perform access control with whatever enforcement mechanisms the network device's hardware and software supports.
The capabilities of a given network device to do port-based access control with the IEEE 802.1X standard are software - and often hardware-dependent! Simply supporting RADIUS does not mean the network device supports many useful enforcement capabilities like MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB), RADIUS Change of Authorization (CoA) [RFC-5176], Layer-3/4 Access Control Lists (ACLs), domain-based ACLs, URL-redirection or software-defined segmentation with Cisco TrustSec. You cannot always tell you what any given network device is capable of and you may need to research that with the vendor or product team.
When people ask; Does ISE support my network device? What they mean is, Can ISE give me all of these modern access control capabilities even with this old, inexpensive switch?
For these older and less expensive switches, ISE offers features like SNMP CoA and Authentication VLAN to provide some similar capabilities needed to handle Guest, BYOD, and Posture flow.
ISE Compatibility Guides
Always check the ISE Compatibility Guides to see what our Quality Assurance (QA) team has Validated for each ISE release.
Network Device Capabilities for ISE
These are modern network device functions typically required to deliver ISE capabilities:
ISE Capability Network Device Features
AAA 802.1X, MAB, VLAN Assignment, Downloadable ACLs
Profiling RADIUS CoA and Profiling Probes
BYOD RADIUS CoA, URL Redirection + SessionID
Guest RADIUS CoA, URL Redirection + SessionID, Local Web Auth
Guest Originating URL RADIUS CoA, URL Redirection + SessionID, Local Web Auth
Posture RADIUS CoA, URL Redirection + SessionID
MDM RADIUS CoA, URL Redirection + SessionID
TrustSec SGT Classification
So what do you do if your network device does not have all of the features for the ISE capability?
Create a Network Access Device (NAD) Profile.
How do you Know the Capabilities of your Network Devices?
The capabilities for validated hardware and software combinations are conveniently documented in our ISE Compatibility Guides. For all others, you need to research this on the vendors' websites, product documentation, forums, etc. Sometimes you may just have to play in your lab to find out what works and what does not and create a Network Device Profile for the different combinations of capabilities.
Unable to see your Hardware or Software in the ISE Compatibility Guide
Just because a hardware model or software release is not explicitly listed, does not mean that it will not work - only that you haven't validated it with ISE! The Supported Network Access Devices  section of the ISE Compatibility Guides states that ISE supports RADIUS, regardless of the vendor or model:
Cisco ISE supports interoperability with any Cisco or non-Cisco RADIUS client network access device (NAD) that implements common RADIUS behavior (similar to Cisco IOS 12.x) for standards-based authentication.
ISE supports protocol standards like RADIUS, its associated RFC Standards, and TACACS+ . If your network device supports RADIUS and/or TACACS+ then ISE can support it!
There are many reasons why both Cisco and non-Cisco devices may not be listed:
Our QA team cannot afford to test every single hardware and software combination with every ISE release.
New hardware platforms must be acquired and tested which usually occurs within 6-9 months after the hardware release.
Every model of a hardware family is not validated - one model is picked and then it is used to represent the hardware family.
Every software release is not validated - one released platform software version recommended by the platform team is picked, a few months before the actual ISE release for QA validation planning.
Older ISE releases are not tested with newer Network Device software but still should per standards.
Exactly what you can do with ISE is then determined by your network device's hardware and software capabilities. It is always recommended that you try your network device hardware and software in your lab with ISE before it is deployed to production so you are confident that it behaves as expected.
ISE Network Access Device (NAD) Profiles
If you have :
non-Cisco hardware
inexpensive, low-end network device hardware
older network device hardware
older network device software
then you can use our ISE Third-Party NAD Profiles and Configs or create your own custom NAD profile. Using a NAD profile, you can completely customize how ISE communicates with your network device whether it is on custom ports for RADIUS CoA or if you need to use Authentication VLANs instead of URL Redirection.
Authentication VLAN Support
If you have some old, legacy switches that are incapable of 802.1X, ISE does have the ability to control endpoint using Authentication VLANs. This is a very crude method of control that uses DNS and DHCP to redirect HTTP traffic to a web portal where the user may authenticate. For more information, see Third-Party Network Device Support in Cisco ISE in the ISE Administrators Guides.
Problems with using Authentication VLANs
You cannot control multiple devices per port.
Traffic filtering is very crude with L2 VLANs - no L3/4 IP/protocol/port control except with a VACL or VRF.
No East/West segmentation within a VLAN means malware is easily spread to other endpoints within VLANs, whether untrusted or trusted.
