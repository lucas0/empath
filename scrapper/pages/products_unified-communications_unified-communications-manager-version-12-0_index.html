Information about product support
Comprehensive unified communications
Cisco Unified Communications Manager is the core call-control application of our collaboration portfolio. It provides reliable, highly secure, scalable, and efficient enterprise call processing and session management. More than 200,000 customers worldwide have deployed over 60 million Cisco IP phones and tens of millions of soft clients.
Features and capabilities
Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CallManager) 12.0 creates simple user experiences and streamlines administration. It also connects premises and cloud collaboration and enhances network security and compliance.
Highlights include:
Enhanced mobile user experience
Receive message and call notifications on iOS devices with Cisco Jabber, using the latest Apple Push Notifications APIs. Upgrade your unified communications network to Cisco Unified Communications Manager 12.0, Expressway 8.10 and Jabber 11.9 to ensure consistent, reliable mobile communications. You'll also get better battery performance.
We've also simplified the extension mobility login process. Mobile workers and those in hot-desk environments can more easily make and receive calls from any IP phone.
Streamlined administration
Which of your UC devices have been idle or are never used? The new Device Last Seen report makes it easier to track down or remove those phones and potentially recover unused licenses.
Also, centralize and simplify management of instant messaging and presence (IM&P) with a new clusterwide IM&P architecture and external IM&P database clean-up tools.
Cisco Spark Hybrid Services
Extend your call control to the cloud. Simplify deployment and administration of hybrid calling services for large deployments with Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition and Cisco Expressway. Home-cluster call routing means fewer direct SIP trunks and less call-routing configuration.
Security and compliance
Working toward your next Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance audit? Is your assessor mandating Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.1 or 1.2 as a minimum? With Unified Communications Manager 12.0 you can now set the minimum TLS version allowed for communication across your key UC interfaces.
Enhanced IPv6 support
Running out of IPv4 address space? Unified Communications Manager 12.0 now gives you the option* to deploy all your 7800 and 8800 Series IP Phones using IPv6 addresses only.
Free up tens of thousands of IP4 addresses, and support your strategic initiatives to move to IPv6 as standard.
* Note: Support for deployments using IPv4 addressing is unchanged.
Simple, flexible, smart
Say goodbye to product-activation keys. Unified Communications Manager 12.0 now supports Smart Software Licensing. Streamline procurement and activation of UC licenses across your network. Get better visibility into usage for compliance and planning purposes. For more detail on these and other updates, read the latest release notes.
