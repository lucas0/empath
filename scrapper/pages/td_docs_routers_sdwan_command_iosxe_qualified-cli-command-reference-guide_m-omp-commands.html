advertise
To advertise additional paths for a BGP peer policy template based on the best path selection, use the advertise command in address family configuration mode at the specific VPN or VRF level.
Route advertisements that you configure with the advertise command apply to all VPNs configured on the router. The advertise command can be issued for either a VPN, or for all VPNs on a device.
advertise [ bgp ] [ connected ] [ ospf type ] [ static ]
no advertise [ bgp ] [ connected ] [ ospf type ] [ static ]
Syntax Description
bgp
BGP Routes:
Advertise all BGP routes learned by the Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices to OMP.
connected
Connected Routes:
Advertise all connected routes on the Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices to OMP. The connected routes are advertised by default. To disable advertisement, use the no advertise connected command.
ospf type
OSPF Routes:
Advertise all OSPF routes learned by the local Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices to OMP. For the global OMP configuration, type can be external, to advertise routes learned from external ASs. For the VPN-specific OMP configuration, type can be external, to advertise routes learned from the local AS. For the global OMP configuration, OSPF external routes are advertised by default.
static
Static Routes:
Advertise all static routes configured on the Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices to OMP. Static routes are advertised by default. To disable advertisement, use the no advertise static command.
Command Default
This command has no default behavior.

send-path-limit number-of-routes
no send-path-limit number-of-routes
Syntax Description
number-of-routes
Maximum number of equal-cost routes that a router advertises to a Cisco SD-WAN controller or that a Cisco SD-WAN controller redistributes to routers. A route is a routeâ€“TLOC tuple. Each TLOC consists of an IP address, color, and encap.
Beginning with Cisco SD-WAN Controllers Release 20.8.x, for a Cisco SD-WAN controller operating within a Hierarchical SD-WAN architecture, the controller can provide up to 32 routes to edge devices. When an edge device installs the routes, it uses the OMP algorithm to select the best 16 routes, and forwards traffic on those routes.
Range: 1 to 16 routes in most Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN overlay networks. For a Cisco SD-WAN controller operating within a Hierarchical SD-WAN architecture, the range is 1 to 32.
Command Default
4 routes are advertised.

timers
To configure OMP timers on Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices and Cisco SD-WAN Controllers, use timers command. When you change an OMP timer on a device, the BFD sessions on that device go down and then come back up. To disable timers, use the no form of this command.
timers [ advertisement-interval interval | eor-timer eor-timer | graceful-restart-timer restart-timer | holdtime holdtime ]
no timers
Syntax Description
eor-timer seconds
End-of-RIB Timer:
Specifies how long to wait after an OMP session has gone down and then come back up to send an end-of-RIB (EOR) marker. After this marker is sent, any routes that werenâ€™t refreshed after the OMP session came back up are considered to be stale and are deleted from the route table.
Range: 1â€“3600 seconds (1 hour)
Default: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
graceful-restart-timer seconds
Graceful Restart Timer:
Specifies how often the OMP information cache is flushed and refreshed. To disable OMP graceful restart, use the no omp graceful-restart command.
Note
  The graceful-restart-timer is peer driven. That is, WAN edge waits for the timer configured on Cisco vSmart to expire before removing the stale routes from the OMP table and Cisco vSmart waits for the timer configured on WAN Edge.
Range: 1â€“604800 seconds (168 hours, or 7 days)
Default: 43200 seconds (12 hours)
holdtime seconds
Holdtime Interval:
Specifies how long to wait before closing the OMP connection to a peer. If the peer doesnâ€™t receive three consecutive keepalive messages within the specified hold time, the OMP connection to the peer is closed. (Note that the keepalive timer is one-third the hold time and isnâ€™t configurable.) If the local device and the peer have different hold time intervals, the higher value is used. If you set the hold time to 0, the keepalive and hold timers on the local device and the peer are set to 0. The hold time must be at least two times the hello tolerance interval set on the WAN tunnel interface in VPN 0. To configure the hello tolerance interval, use the hello-tolerance command.
Range: 0â€“65535 seconds
Default: 60 seconds
advertisement-interval seconds
Update Advertisement Interval:
Configures the amount of time between OMP Update packets.
Range: 0â€“65535 seconds
Default: 1 second

tloc-color-compatibility
To override the default compatibilities of TLOC colors, use the tloc-color-compatibility command in system configuration mode. To cancel the configuration, use the no form of the command.
tloc-color-compatibility { compatible first-color second-color | incompatible first-color second-color }
no tloc-color-compatibility { compatible first-color second-color | incompatible first-color second-color }
Syntax Description
compatible first-color second-color
Configure two TLOC colors to be compatible, even if they are incompatible by default.
incompatible first-color second-color
Configure two TLOC colors to be incompatible, even if they are compatible by default.
Command Default
The command has no default.
Command Modes
system configuration (config-system)
Command History
Release Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.11.1a
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
Using route filtering, Cisco SD-WAN controllers can reduce the number of routes that they advertise to routers in the network, to exclude routes that are not relevant to a particular device. The filtering is based on the colors of TLOCs on each device: For each individual device, the Cisco SD-WAN controller does not advertise routes that are not compatible with any of the deviceâ€™s TLOCs. For example, if a router only has a TLOC with color mpls, which is a private color, then a Cisco SD-WAN controller does not advertise a route for a TLOC of with the public-internet color, because the router cannot resolve this public route.
Example
This example, executed on a Cisco SD-WAN controller, does the following:
Configures the lte and private1 TLOC colors to be compatible
Configures the private1 and private2 TLOC colors to be compatible
Configures the lte and default TLOC colors to be incompatible
Configures the lte and 3g TLOC colors to be incompatible
vsmart(config)# system 
vsmart(config-system)# host-name vm1
vsmart(config-system)# tloc-color-compatibility
vsmart(config-tloc-color-compatibility)# compatible lte private1 
vsmart(config-compatible-lte/private1)# exit
vsmart(config-tloc-color-compatibility)# compatible private1 private2
vsmart(config-compatible-private1/private2)# exit
vsmart(config-tloc-color-compatibility)# incompatible lte default
vsmart(config-incompatible-lte/default)# exit
vsmart(config-tloc-color-compatibility)# incompatible lte 3g
vsmart(config-incompatible-lte/3g)# exit
vsmart(config-tloc-color-compatibility)# exit
vsmart(config-system)# exit
vsmart(config)# 
The following example shows the same configuration using a CLI template in Cisco SD-WAN Manager:
system
 host-name vm1
 tloc-color-compatibility
  compatible lte private1
  !
  compatible private1 private2
  !
  incompatible lte default
  !
  incompatible lte 3g
  !
 !
To reverse a compatible or incompatible command, use the no form, as follows:
vsmart(config-tloc-color-compatibility)# no compatible lte private1
