Cisco ISE Reports
Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) reports are used with monitoring and troubleshooting features to analyze trends, and, monitor system performance and network activities from a central location.
Cisco ISE collects log and configuration data from across the network. It then aggregates the data into reports for you to view and analyze. Cisco ISE provides a standard set of predefined reports that you can use and customize to fit your needs.
Cisco ISE reports are preconfigured and e grouped into logical categories with information related to authentication, session traffic, device administration, configuration and administration, and troubleshooting.

Schedule and Save Cisco ISE Reports
You can customize a report and save the changes as a new report, or restore the default report settings.
You can also customize and schedule Cisco ISE reports to run and re-run at specific time or time intervals. You can also send and receive email notifications for the reports generated.
When scheduling reports with Hourly frequency, you can have the report run over multiple days, but the timeframe cannot spread across two days.
For example, when scheduling an hourly report from May 4, 2019, to May 8, 2019, you can set the time interval as between 6:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. each day, but not between 6:00 p.m. of one day and 11:00 a.m. of the next. Cisco ISE displays an error message that the time range is invalid in the latter case.

Note
If an external administrator (for example: Active Directory Administrator) creates a scheduled report without filling in the email-id field, no email notifications are sent.
You cannot schedule the following reports:
Authentication Summary

Cisco ISE Active RADIUS Sessions
Cisco ISE provides a dynamic Change of Authorization (CoA) feature for the Live Sessions that allows you to dynamically control active RADIUS sessions. You can send reauthenticate or disconnect requests to a Network Access Device (NAD) to perform the following tasks:
Troubleshoot issues related to authentication—You can use the Session reauthentication option to follow up with an attempt to reauthenticate again. However, you must not use this option to restrict access. To restrict access, use the shutdown option.
Block a problematic host—You can use the Session termination with port shutdown option to block an infected host that sends a lot of traffic over the network. However, the RADIUS protocol does not currently support a method for re-enabling a port that has been shut down.
Force endpoints to reacquire IP addresses—You can use the Session termination with port bounce option for endpoints that do not have a supplicant or client to generate a DHCP request after a VLAN change.
Push an updated authorization policy to an endpoint—You can use the Session reauthentication option to enforce an updated policy configuration, such as a change in the authorization policy on existing sessions based on the discretion of the administrator. For example, if posture validation is enabled, when an endpoint gains access initially, it is usually quarantined. After the identity and posture of the endpoint are known, it is possible to send the Session reauthentication command to the endpoint for the endpoint to acquire the actual authorization policy based on its posture.
For CoA commands to be understood by the device, it is important that you configure the options appropriately.
For CoA to work properly, you must configure the shared secret of each device that requires a dynamic change of authorization. Cisco ISE uses the shared secret configuration to request access from the device and issue CoA commands to it.

Note
In this release of Cisco ISE, the maximum number of active authenticated endpoint sessions that can be displayed is limited to 100,000.

Change Authorization for RADIUS Sessions
Some Network Access Devices on your network may not send an Accounting Stop or Accounting Off packet after a reload. As a result, you might find two sessions in the Session Directory reports, one which has expired.
To dynamically change the authorization of an active RADIUS session or disconnect an active RADIUS session, be sure to choose the most recent session.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Operations > RADIUS Livelog.
Step 2
Switch the view to Show Live Session.
Step 3
Click the CoA link for the RADIUS session that you want to issue CoA and choose one of the following options:
SAnet Session Query—Use this to query information about sessions from SAnet supported devices.
Session reauthentication—Reauthenticate session. If you select this option for a session established on an ASA device supporting COA, this will invoke a Session Policy Push CoA.
Session reauthentication with last—Use the last successful authentication method for this session.
Session reauthentication with rerun—Run through the configured authentication method from the beginning.
Note 
Session reauthentication with last and Session reauthentication with rerun options are not currently supported in Cisco IOS software.
Session termination—Just end the session. The switch reauthenticates the client in a different session.
Session termination with port bounce—Terminate the session and restart the port.
Session termination with port shutdown—Terminate the session and shutdown the port.
Step 4
Click Run to issue CoA with the selected reauthenticate or terminate option.
If your CoA fails, it could be one of the following reasons:
Device does not support CoA.
Changes have occurred to the identity or authorization policy.
There is a shared secret mismatch.

Note 
RADIUS Suppression should be enabled to run this report.
—
Network Device Session Status
The Network Device Session Status Summary report enables you to display the switch configuration without logging into the switch directly.
Cisco ISE accesses these details using an SNMP query and requires that your network devices are configured with SNMP v1/v2c.
If a user is experiencing network issues, this report can help you identify if the issue is related to the switch configuration rather than with Cisco ISE.
—
OCSP Monitoring
The OCSP Monitoring Report specifies the status of the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) services. It identifies whether Cisco ISE can successfully contact a certificate server and provides certificate status auditing. Provides a summary of all the OCSP certificate validation operations performed by Cisco ISE. It retrieves information related to the good and revoked primary and secondary certificates from the OCSP server. Cisco ISE caches the responses and utilizes them for generating subsequent OCSP Monitoring Reports. In the event the cache is cleared, it retrieves information from the OCSP server.
Choose Administration > System > Logging > Logging Categories and select System Diagnostics.
RADIUS Errors
The RADIUS Errors report enables you to check for RADIUS Requests Dropped (authentication/accounting requests discarded from unknown Network Access Device), EAP connection time outs, and unknown NADs.
Note 
You can view the report only for the past 5 days.
Choose Administration > System > Logging > Logging Categories and select Failed Attempts.
System Diagnostics
The System Diagnostic report provides details about the status of the Cisco ISE nodes. If a Cisco ISE node is unable to register, you can review this report to troubleshoot the issue.
This report requires that you first enable several diagnostic logging categories. Collecting these logs can negatively impact Cisco ISE performance. So, these categories are not enabled by default, and you should enable them just long enough to collect the data. Otherwise, they are automatically disabled after 30 minutes.
Choose Administration > System > Logging > Logging Categories and select these logging categories: Internal Operations Diagnostics, Distributed Management, Administrator Authentication and Authorization.
Endpoints and Users
Authentication Summary
The Authentication Summary report is based on the RADIUS authentications. It enables you to identify the most common authentications and the reason for any authentication failures. For example, if one Cisco ISE server is handling significantly more authentications than others, you might want to reassign users to different Cisco ISE servers to better balance the load.
Note 
As the Authentication Summary report or dashboard collects and displays the latest data corresponding to failed or passed authentications, the contents of the report appear after a delay of a few minutes.
—
Agentless Posture
Lists all endpoints that ran Agentless posture.
Client Provisioning
The Client Provisioning report indicates the client provisioning agents applied to particular endpoints. You can use this report to verify the policies applied to each endpoint to verify whether the endpoints have been correctly provisioned.
Note 
MAC address of an endpoint is not displayed in the Endpoint ID column, if the endpoint does not connect with ISE (no session is established) or if a Network Address Translation (NAT) address is used for the session.
Choose Administration > System > Logging > Logging Categories and select Posture and Client Provisioning Audit and Posture and Client Provisioning Diagnostics.
Current Active Sessions
The Current Active Sessions report enables you to export a report with details about who was currently on the network within a specified time period.
