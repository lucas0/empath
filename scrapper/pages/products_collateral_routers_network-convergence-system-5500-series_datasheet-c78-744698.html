    Product overview
With global data center and public/private cloud network traffic growing at more than 25 percent annually, network providers and hyperscalers alike are rapidly adopting 400GE as the basis for their mass-scale core and aggregation networks. The Cisco® Network Convergence System 5700 Series builds on the success of previous Cisco NCS 5500 fixed systems by combining the latest in forwarding ASIC design with the advanced innovation of Cisco IOS® XR7.
The NCS-57B1-6D24-SYS and NCS-57B1-5DSE-SYS break new ground by combining 4.8 Terabits of 400GE/100GE optimized forwarding capacity, QSFP-DD optics, deep packet buffering, full line-rate MACsec, Class C 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP), and Synchronous Ethernet (SyncE) in an extremely power-efficient, 1-rack-unit package. The industry-leading Cisco IOS XR7 pushes the scalability of the hardware even further through the use of flexible database profiles that allow ASIC and TCAM resources to be reconfigured by network role. Next-generation security, automation, telemetry, segment routing, EVPN, and Equal-Cost Multipathing (ECMP) capabilities make XR7 the perfect complement to the NCS-57B1 series.
