Create an Identity Group for the policy
Check one of the following options to create an endpoint identity group:
Yes, create matching Identity Group
No, use existing Identity Group hierarchy
Yes, create matching Identity Group
Choose this option to use an existing profiling policy.
This option creates a matching identity group for those endpoints and the identity group will be the child of the Profiled endpoint identity group when an endpoint profile matches an existing profiling policy.
For example, the Xerox-Device endpoint identity group is created in the Endpoints Identity Groups page when endpoints discovered on your network match the Xerox-Device profile.
No, use existing Identity Group hierarchy
Check this check box to assign endpoints to the matching parent endpoint identity group using hierarchical construction of profiling policies and identity groups.
This option allows you to make use of the endpoint profiling policies hierarchy to assign endpoints to one of the matching parent endpoint identity groups, as well as to the associated endpoint identity groups to the parent identity group.
For example, endpoints that match an existing profile are grouped under the appropriate parent endpoint identity group. Here, endpoints that match the Unknown profile are grouped under Unknown, and endpoints that match an existing profile are grouped under the Profiled endpoint identity group. For example,
If endpoints match the Cisco-IP-Phone profile, then they are grouped under the Cisco-IP-Phone endpoint identity group.
If endpoints match the Workstation profile, then they are grouped under the Workstation endpoint identity group.
The Cisco-IP-Phone and Workstation endpoint identity groups are associated to the Profiled endpoint identity group in the system.
Parent Policy
Choose a parent profiling policy that are defined in the system to which you want to associate the new endpoint profiling policy.
You can choose a parent profiling policy from which you can inherit rules and conditions to its child.

Endpoint Context Visibility Using UDID Attribute
Endpoint Context Visibility Using UDID Attribute
The Unique Identifier (UDID) is an endpoint attribute that identifies MAC addresses of a particular endpoint. An endpoint can have multiple MAC addresses. For example, one MAC address for the wired interface and another for the wireless interface. The AnyConnect agent generates a UDID for that endpoint, and saves it as an endpoint attribute. The UDID remains constant for an endpoint; the UDID does not change with the AnyConnect installation or uninstallation. When using UDID, Context Visibility window (Context Visibility > Endpoints > Compliance) displays one entry instead of multiple entries for endpoints with multiple NICs. You can ensure posture control on a specific endpoint rather than on a Mac address.

Note
The endpoint must have AnyConnect 4.7 or higher to create the UDID.
RADIUS Vendor Dictionary Attribute Settings
This section describes RADIUS vendor dictionaries used in Cisco ISE.
The following table describes the fields in the Dictionary window for RADIUS vendors, which allows you to configure dictionary attributes for the RADIUS vendors. The navigation path for this window is Policy > Policy Elements > Dictionaries > System > RADIUS > RADIUS Vendors.
Table 5. RADIUS Vendor Dictionary Attribute Settings
Field Name
Usage Guidelines

Enable MAC option
Check this check box to enable the comparison of RADIUS attribute as MAC address. By default, for the RADIUS attribute calling-station-id this option is marked as enabled and you cannot disable it. For other dictionary attributes (of string types) within the RADIUS vendor dictionary, you can enable or disable this option.
Once you enable this option, while setting the authentication and authorization conditions, you can define whether the comparison is clear string by selecting the Text option or whether it is MAC address by selecting the MAC address option.
Direction
Choose one of the options that applies to RADIUS messages:
ID
Enter the vendor attribute ID. The valid range is 0 to 255.
Allow Tagging
Check this check box to mark the attribute as being permitted to have a tag, as defined in RFC2868. The purpose of the tag is to allow grouping of attributes for tunnelled users. See RFC2868 for more details.
The tagged attributes support ensures that all attributes pertaining to a given tunnel contain the same value in their respective tag fields, and that each set includes an appropriately-valued instance of the Tunnel-Preference attribute. This conforms to the tunnel attributes that are to be used in a multi-vendor network environment, thereby eliminating interoperability issues among Network Access Servers (NASs) manufactured by different vendors.
Allow Multiple Instances of this Attribute in a Profile
Check this check box when you want multiple instances of this RADIUS vendor specific attribute in profiles.

Continuous Endpoint Attribute Monitoring
You can use the AnyConnect agent to continuously monitor different endpoint attributes to ensure that dynamic changes are observed during posture assessment. This improves the overall visibility of an endpoint and helps you create posture policies based on their behavior. The AnyConnect agent monitors applications that are installed and running on an endpoint. You can turn on and off the feature and configure how often the data should be monitored. By default, data is collected every 5 minutes and is stored in the database. During initial posture, AnyConnect reports a complete list of running and installed applications. After initial posture, the AnyConnect agent scans the applications every X minute and sends the differences from the last scan to the server. The server displays the complete list of running and installed applications.

The following table describes the fields in the Allowed Protocols window, which allows you to configure the protocols to be used during authentication. The navigation path is Policy > Policy Elements > Results > Authentication > Allowed Protocols.
Table 21. Allowed Protocols
Field Name
Usage Guidelines
Allowed Protocols > Authentication Bypass
Process Host Lookup
Check this check box if you want Cisco ISE to process the Host Lookup request. The Host Lookup request is processed for PAP/CHAP protocol when the RADIUS Service-Type equals 10 (Call-Check) and the username is equal to Calling-Station-ID. The Host Lookup request is processed for EAP-MD5 protocol when the Service-Type equals 1 (Framed) and the username is equal to Calling-Station-ID. Uncheck this check box if you want Cisco ISE to ignore the Host Lookup request and use the original value of the system username attribute for authentication. When unchecked, message processing is done according to the protocol (for example, PAP).
Note 
Disabling this option could result in the failure of existing MAB authentications.
Allowed Protocols > Authentication Protocols
Allow PAP/ASCII
This option enables PAP/ASCII. PAP uses cleartext passwords (that is, unencrypted passwords) and is the least secure authentication protocol.
Allow CHAP
This option enables CHAP authentication. CHAP uses a challenge-response mechanism with password encryption. CHAP does not work with Microsoft Active Directory.
Allow MS-CHAPv1
Check this check box to enable MS-CHAPv1.
Allow MS-CHAPv2
Check this check box to enable MS-CHAPv2.
Allow EAP-MD5
Check this check box to enable EAP-based MD5 password hashed authentication.
Allow EAP-TLS
Check this check box to enable EAP-TLS Authentication protocol and configures EAP-TLS settings. You can specify how Cisco ISE will verify the user identity as presented in the EAP identity response from the end-user client. User identity is verified against information in the certificate that the end-user client presents. This comparison occurs after an EAP-TLS tunnel is established between Cisco ISE and the end-user client.
Note 
EAP-TLS is a certificate-based authentication protocol. EAP-TLS authentication can occur only after you have completed the required steps to configure certificates.
Allow authentication of expired certificates to allow certificate renewal in Authorization Policy: Check this check box, if you want to allow users to renew certificates. If you check this check box, ensure that you configure appropriate authorization policy rules to check if the certificate has been renewed before processing the request any further.
Enable Stateless Session Resume: Check this check box to allow EAP-TLS session resumption without requiring the session state to be stored at the server. Cisco ISE supports session ticket extension as described in RFC 5077. Cisco ISE creates a ticket and sends it to an EAP-TLS client. The client presents the ticket to ISE to resume a session.
Proactive Session Ticket update: Enter the value as a percentage to indicate how much of the Time To Live (TTL) must elapse before the session ticket is updated. For example, if you enter the value 60, the session ticket is updated after 60 percent of the TTL has expired.
Session ticket Time to Live: Enter the time after which the session ticket expires. This value determines the duration that a session ticket remains active. You can enter the value in seconds, minutes, hours, days, or weeks.
Allow LEAP
Check this check box to enable Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP) authentication.
Allow PEAP
Check this check box to enable PEAP authentication protocol and PEAP settings. The default inner method is MS-CHAPv2.
When you check the Allow PEAP check box, you can configure the following PEAP inner methods:
Allow EAP-MS-CHAPv2: Check this check box to use EAP-MS-CHAPv2 as the inner method.
Allow Password Change: Check this check box for Cisco ISE to support password changes.
Retry Attempts: Specifies how many times Cisco ISE requests user credentials before returning login failure. Valid values are 0 to 3.
Allow EAP-GTC: Check this check box to use EAP-GTC as the inner method.
Allow Password Change: Check this check box for Cisco ISE to support password changes.
Retry Attempts: Specifies how many times Cisco ISE requests user credentials before returning login failure. The valid range is from 0 to 3.
Allow EAP-TLS: Check this check box to use EAP-TLS as the inner method.
Check the Allow authentication of expired certificates to allow certificate renewal in Authorization Policy check box, if you want to allow users to renew certificates. If you check this check box, ensure that you configure appropriate authorization policy rules to check if the certificate has been renewed before processing the request any further.
Require Cryptobinding TLV: Check this check box if you want both the EAP peer and the EAP server to participate in the inner and outer EAP authentications of the PEAP authentication.
Allow PEAPv0 Only for Legacy Clients: Check this check box to allow PEAP supplicants to negotiate using PEAPv0. Some legacy clients do not conform to the PEAPv1 protocol standards. To ensure that such PEAP conversations are not dropped, check this check box.
Allow EAP-FAST
Check this check box to enable EAP-FAST authentication protocol and EAP-FAST settings. The EAP-FAST protocol can support multiple internal protocols on the same server. The default inner method is MS-CHAPv2.
When you check the Allow EAP-FAST check box, you can configure EAP-FAST as the inner method:
Allow EAP-MS-CHAPv2
Allow Password Change: Check this check box for Cisco ISE to support password changes.
Retry Attempts: Specifies how many times Cisco ISE requests user credentials before returning login failure. Valid values are 0-3.
Allow EAP-GTC
Allow Password Change: Check this check box for Cisco ISE to support password changes.
Retry Attempts: Specifies how many times Cisco ISE requests user credentials before returning login failure. Valid values are 0-3.
Use PACs: Choose this option to configure Cisco ISE to provision authorization Protected Access Credentials (PAC) for EAP-FAST clients. Additional PAC options appear.
Don't Use PACs: Choose this option to configure Cisco ISE to use EAP-FAST without issuing or accepting any tunnel or machine PACs. All requests for PACs are ignored and Cisco ISE responds with a Success-TLV without a PAC.
When you choose this option, you can configure Cisco ISE to perform machine authentication.
Allow EAP-TLS: Check this check box to use EAP-TLS as the inner method.
Check the Allow authentication of expired certificates to allow certificate renewal in Authorization Policy check box, if you want to allow users to renew certificates. If you check this check box, ensure that you configure appropriate authorization policy rules to check if the certificate has been renewed before processing the request any further.
Enable EAP Chaining: Check this check box to enable EAP chaining.
EAP chaining allows Cisco ISE to correlate the results of user and machine authentication and apply the appropriate authorization policy using the EAPChainingResult attribute.
EAP chaining requires a supplicant that supports EAP chaining on the client device. Choose the User and Machine Authentication option in the supplicant.
EAP chaining is available when you choose the EAP-FAST protocol (both in PAC based and PAC less mode).
For PAC-based authentication, you can use user authorization PAC or machine authorization PAC, or both to skip the inner method.
For certificate-based authentication, if you enable the Accept Client Certificate for Provisioning option for the EAP-FAST protocol (in the Allowed Protocol service), and if the endpoint (AnyConnect) is configured to send the user certificate inside the tunnel, then during tunnel establishment, ISE authenticates the user using the certificate (the inner method is skipped), and machine authentication is done through the inner method. If these options are not configured, EAP-TLS is used as the inner method for user authentication.
After you enable EAP chaining, update your authorization policy and add a condition using the NetworkAccess:EapChainingResult attribute and assign appropriate permissions.
Allow EAP-TTLS
Check this check box to enable EAP-TTLS protocol.
You can configure the following inner methods:
Allow PAP/ASCII: Check this check box to use PAP/ASCII as the inner method. You can use EAP-TTLS PAP for token and OTP-based authentications.
Allow CHAP: Check this check box to use CHAP as the inner method. CHAP uses a challenge-response mechanism with password encryption. CHAP does not work with Microsoft Active Directory.
Allow MS-CHAPv1: Check this check box to use MS-CHAPv1 as the inner method.
Allow MS-CHAPv2: Check this check box to use MS-CHAPv2 as the inner method.
Allow EAP-MD5: Check this check box to use EAP-MD5 as the inner method.
Allow EAP-MS-CHAPv2: Check this check box to use EAP-MS-CHAPv2 as the inner method.
Allow Password Change: Check this check box for Cisco ISE to support password changes.
Retry Attempts: Specifies how many times Cisco ISE requests user credentials before returning login failure. Valid values are 0 to 3.
Preferred EAP Protocol
Check this check box to choose your preferred EAP protocols from any of the following options: EAP-FAST, PEAP, LEAP, EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, and EAP-MD5. If you do not specify the preferred protocol, EAP-TLS is used by default.
EAP-TLS L-bit
Check this check box to support legacy EAP supplicants that expect length-included flag (L-bit flag) by default in TLS Change Cipher Spec message and Encrypted Handshake message from ISE.
Allow Weak Ciphers for EAP
If this option is enabled, legacy clients are allowed to negotiate using weak ciphers (such as RSA_RC4_128_SHA, RSA_RC4_128_MD5). We recommend that you enable this option only if your legacy clients support only weak ciphers.
This option is disabled by default.
Note 
Cisco ISE does not support EDH_RSA_DES_64_CBC_SHA and EDH_DSS_DES_64_CBC_SHA.
Require Message Authenticator for all RADIUS Requests
If this option is enabled, Cisco ISE verifies whether the RADIUS Message Authenticator attribute is present in the RADIUS message. If the message authenticator attribute is not present, the RADIUS message is discarded.
Enabling this option provides protection from spoofed Access-Request messages and RADIUS message tampering.
The RADIUS Message Authenticator attribute is a Message Digest 5 (MD5) hash of the entire RADIUS message.
Note 
EAP uses the Message Authenticator attribute by default and does not require that you enable it.
Allow 5G
Check this check box to enable Cisco Private 5G in Cisco ISE.
Note 
You must already have Cisco Private 5G deployed in your network, prior to enabling 5G as a Service (5GaaS) in Cisco ISE

Table 22. PAC Options
Field Name
Usage Guidelines
Use PAC
Tunnel PAC Time To Live: The Time to Live (TTL) value restricts the lifetime of the PAC. Specify the lifetime value and units. The default is 90 days. The range is between 1 and 1825 days.
Proactive PAC Update When: <n%> of PAC TTL is Left: The Update value ensures that the client has a valid PAC. Cisco ISE initiates an update after the first successful authentication but before the expiration time that is set by the TTL. The update value is a percentage of the remaining time in the TTL. The default is 90%.
Allow Anonymous In-band PAC Provisioning: Check this check box for Cisco ISE to establish a secure anonymous TLS handshake with the client and provision it with a PAC by using phase zero of EAP-FAST with EAP-MSCHAPv2. To enable anonymous PAC provisioning, you must choose both of the inner methods, EAP-MSCHAPv2 and EAP-GTC.
Allow Authenticated In-band PAC Provisioning: Cisco ISE uses SSL server-side authentication to provision the client with a PAC during phase zero of EAP-FAST. This option is more secure than anonymous provisioning but requires that a server certificate and a trusted root CA be installed on Cisco ISE.
When you check this option, you can configure Cisco ISE to return an Access-Accept message to the client after successful authenticated PAC provisioning.
Server Returns Access Accept After Authenticated Provisioning: Check this check box if you want Cisco ISE to return an access-accept package after authenticated PAC provisioning.
Allow Machine Authenticatio: Check this check box for Cisco ISE to provision an end-user client with a machine PAC and perform machine authentication (for end-user clients who do not have the machine credentials). The machine PAC can be provisioned to the client by request (in-band) or by the administrator (out-of-band). When Cisco ISE receives a valid machine PAC from the end-user client, the machine identity details are extracted from the PAC and verified in the Cisco ISE external identity source. Cisco ISE only supports Active Directory as an external identity source for machine authentication. After these details are correctly verified, no further authentication is performed.
When you check this option, you can enter a value for the amount of time that a machine PAC is acceptable for use. When Cisco ISE receives an expired machine PAC, it automatically reprovisions the end-user client with a new machine PAC (without waiting for a new machine PAC request from the end-user client).
Enable Stateless Session Resume: Check this check box for Cisco ISE to provision authorization PACs for EAP-FAST clients and skip phase two of EAP-FAST (default = enabled).
Uncheck this check box in the following cases:
If you do not want Cisco ISE to provision authorization PACs for EAP-FAST clients
To always perform phase two of EAP-FAST
When you check this option, you can enter the authorization period of the user authorization PAC. After this period, the PAC expires. When Cisco ISE receives an expired authorization PAC, it performs phase two EAP-FAST authentication.

USB Mass Storage Check Workflow
You can use the USB_Check condition (Cisco predefined) in a posture policy to check if a USB mass storage device is connected to an endpoint . The USB mass storage check and remediation flow is described below.
The AnyConnect agent:
Checks for a USB connection.
Detects a USB plug-in and applies the USB_Block remediation (Cisco predefined). The AnyConnect agent reports a remediation failure to Cisco ISE and initiates a CoA. The USB mass storage remediation is always active and is not limited to the time of access or Periodic reassessment (PRA).
Stops running the USB detection, when the user disconnects from the network interface.
Runs the posture flow again, when the endpoint reconnects. However, if the endpoint is in the posture lease period, the AnyConnect agent does not run the USB check again.

Note
AnyConnect performs the USB check and remediation sequentially. Consequently, there may be a delay in handling USB dynamic change while performing PRA. When the USB check is configured, it is recommended to minimize the PRA grace time (Work Centers > Posture > Settings > Reassessment Configurations) for the other checks.

Note
You cannot create a compound condition for USB check.
