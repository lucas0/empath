Introduction
The Cisco® Enterprise Agreement (EA) comprises five portfolios that encompass our software and services suites. These include Networking Infrastructure, Applications Infrastructure, Collaboration, Security, and Services. An EA offers you more than just a service agreement or buying program; it brings you the power and breadth of our entire software and services portfolio under a single, simplified agreement. It gives you easy access to the Cisco technologies you need to scale rapidly and accelerate at the speed of business. Not only does an EA simplify purchasing, it also offers you a future-ready software subscription strategy that delivers greater value, agility, and flexibility for your organization.
One agreement
The Cisco EA is designed to cover your entire organization. When you purchase through an EA, the EA Program Terms will apply from your initial purchase to any future purchases you make within the term of the agreement. With Cisco’s EA management platform, you can manage your Cisco EA from one place with complete visibility and granular control.

Financial benefits
Financial benefits of the new EA
In addition to delivering on technology and business needs, the new EA offers financial benefits designed for the needs of enterprises. The following are a few examples:
Financial flexibility
As with technology, financing increasingly needs to be more dynamic. The new EA delivers new levels of flexibility for financing, such as flexible terms and volume ramp options.
Financial predictability with True Forward
The financial predictability of True Forward makes the EA stand out from other agreements. Unlike enterprise licensing agreements from other technology providers that require businesses to true up every year, the new EA does not retroactively charge for a year's extra usage if it stays within 15 percent of the initial order. This saves you from potentially having a large, unexpected bill at your contract anniversary—as frequently happens with other technology providers. Instead, Cisco will work with you to update the next year’s contract to bring it closer in line with your actual usage.
