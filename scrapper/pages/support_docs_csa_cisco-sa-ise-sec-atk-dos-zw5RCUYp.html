Summary
A vulnerability in a feature that monitors RADIUS requests on Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to negatively affect the performance of an affected device.
This vulnerability is due to insufficient management of system resources. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by taking actions that cause Cisco ISE Software to receive specific RADIUS traffic. A successful and sustained exploit of this vulnerability could allow the attacker to cause reduced performance of the affected device, resulting in significant delays to RADIUS authentications.
Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Affected Products
Vulnerable Products
At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco ISE Software if the software was configured to detect a steady, high rate of RADIUS requests. This configuration is disabled by default.
For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.
Determine the Device Configuration
To determine if a device is vulnerable, log in to the web management GUI with super admin privileges. Choose Administration > System > Settings > Protocols > RADIUS. If Detect High Rate of RADIUS Requests is checked, the device is vulnerable.
Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.
Workarounds
As a workaround, customers who do not require the detection of a steady, high rate of RADIUS requests for their daily operations may disable the detection to prevent the exploitation of this vulnerability. To disable this feature, log in to the web management GUI with super admin privileges. Choose Administration > System > Settings > Protocols > RADIUS and uncheck Detect High Rate of RADIUS Requests.
While this workaround has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.
Fixed Software
When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page, to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.
In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
