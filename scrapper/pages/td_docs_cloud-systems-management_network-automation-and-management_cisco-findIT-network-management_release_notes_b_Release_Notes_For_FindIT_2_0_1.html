License Requirements
FindIT Network Manager is a licensed application. Device licenses are required for each Cisco 100 to 500 series product being managed. A count of up to ten Cisco 100 to 500 series devices may be managed in Evaluation Mode without a license. For more information, please refer to the FindIT Network Manager Datasheet page.
Upgrading to Cisco FindIT 2.0.1 from 2.0.0
To upgrade from FindIT Network Manager or Probe version 2.0.1 to version 2.0.0, do the following:
On the Manager, click About FindIT
Select the radio button next to the Manager update and click Upgrade. The Manager will download and apply the update and then restart
Log back on to the Manager, click About FindIT again
Select the radio button next to the Probe update and click Upgrade. Each Probe will download and apply the update and then restart

Note
For more details on each step of this process, refer to the corresponding section of the Cisco FindIT Network Management Administration Guide.
Upgrading to Cisco FindIT 2.0.1 from 1.1.x
To upgrade from FindIT Network Manager or Probe version 1.1.x to version 2.0.1, do the following:
On the Manager, click About FindIT
Select the radio button next to the Manager update and click Upgrade. The Manager will download and apply the update and then restart
Log back on to the Manager, click About FindIT again
Select the radio button next to the Probe update and click Upgrade. Each Probe will download and apply the update and then restart
When upgrading from 1.1.x to 2.0.1, the following changes will be made during the upgrade process:
Each Network Plug and Play Project will be converted to a network and a device group with names corresponding to the project name prefixed with PnP
Device Groups defined on each probe are moved to the manager and the group name is prefixed with the name of the network
Network and System configuration profiles will be moved to the manager
In addition, certain information previously stored on the Probe will not be migrated to the Manager:
Device credentials defined in the Add New Credentials section of the Device Credentials page will not be migrated to the Manager. However, any device that has working credentials assigned will continue to have those credentials assigned after the upgrade.
Device configuration backups will not be retained through the upgrade. Backups should be downloaded to the local PC prior to performing the upgrade.
Floorplans will be lost during the upgrade.
Any dashboard customization will be lost during the upgrade.

Note
Probe configuration will only be migrated to the manager if the probe upgrade is triggered through the manager user interface. If the probe upgrade is triggered from the probe user interface, or the probe is manually upgraded by running the linux installer on the probe platform, the configuration migration process will not take place.
Support for 1.1.x Probes with a 2.0.1 Manager
FindIT Network Manager 2.0.1 provides limited support for FindIT Network Probe version 1.1.x to allow upgrades to be gradually deployed across the network. Selecting the network and clicking Manage opens the Probe GUI in a new window giving the same experience as with a version 1.1.x manager. The network may then be managed through the probe user interface as normal. Please note that any changes to the network name or location in the Probe user interface will not be reflected in the Manager user interface.
In addition to the ability to access the probe user interface directly, the following functionality is available from the Manager user interface:
Viewing device information through the inventory is supported for networks with probe version 1.1.x
The Lifecycle, End of Life and Maintenance reports include devices from networks with probe version 1.1.x
The Event Log displays events for networks with probe version 1.1.x
The probe may be upgraded to version 2.0.1 from the manager user interface
Limitations and Restrictions
The Cisco FindIT Network limitations and restrictions are described in the following sections:
General Limitations
System Backup and Restore
General Limitations
The web interface on FindIT Network Manager takes a few minutes to become operational after the application is started
Depending on the size of the network, it may take the Probe several minutes to discover all devices and calculate the network topology
Up to 50 network devices can be managed by single Probe instance
Up to 2500 devices can be managed by a single Manager instance
SNMPv3 authentication keys and privacy keys must be at least 8 characters in length
When using Safari, ensure that the certificate presented by the FindIT Network Probe is set to Always Trust
System Backup and Restore
When performing a system backup or restore, FindIT will prevent you from doing any further configuration actions
Prior to beginning a system backup or restore, the idle timeout value in Administration > User Management > User Session Settings should be set to at least 30 minutes (default is 60 minutes)
