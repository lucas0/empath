Setting Up Your Cisco CSP 2100 and Configuring Services
Summary Steps
Setting up your Cisco Cloud Services Platform 2100 (Cisco CSP 2100) and creating services consists of the following high-level steps:
Procedure
Step 1   Upgrade the Cisco CSP 2100 software or perform the initial setup.
Step 2   Log in to the Cisco CSP 2100.
Step 3   Generate and install an SSL certificate.
Step 4   Access the Cisco CSP 2100 through the web interface.
Step 5   Upload the service image to the Cisco CSP 2100.
Step 6   Create a service.
You must define the host, image, network type, and any additional information required by the service. Optionally, you can define high availability, the VLAN configuration, vNIC drivers, and default resources.
Step 7   Verify the service instance.
Upgrading the Cisco CSP 2100 Software
You can upgrade the Cisco CSP 2100 software by installing an ISO image through any of the following methods:
Using the Cisco Integrated Management Controller (CIMC) KVM console: Map the ISO image to the Virtual CD/DVD by using the CIMC console and then install the image. The ISO image installation through CIMC console is useful for clean installations because the CIMC KVM or a direct console connected to the Cisco CSP 2100 system is required to perform the tasks described in Performing the Initial Setup.
Using the Cisco CSP 2100 CLI: Copy the update ISO image to the repository, specify the installation mode, and then install the image. The ISO image installation through CLI is more useful for software updates because the CIMC KVM or direct console support is not required to configure the system. After the installation is complete and the system reboots, the Cisco CSP 2100 system can be accessed through Secure Shell (SSH).
Upgrading the Cisco CSP 2100 Software Using CLI
To upgrade the Cisco CSP 2100 software using CLI, do the following:
Procedure
Step 1   Copy the update ISO image to the repository by running the copy image source_filename destination_filename command.
Step 2   Specify the installation mode by running the system install iso mode {clean-install | software-update} command.
By default, the installation mode is set to software-update and existing configurations and settings are retained in the new installation. If you do not want to retain the existing configurations and settings, you can change the installation mode to clean-install.
Note   
Only clean installation is supported in Release 2.1.0. Upgrade from Cisco CSP 2100 Release 1.0 and 2.0.0 to Release 2.1.0 is not supported.
Step 3   Initiate the installation by running the system install iso update image imagename.iso command.
Performing the Initial Setup
Before You Begin
Make sure that the Cisco CSP 2100 is set up correctly and is cabled for network access. For information about setting up the Cisco CSP 2100, see the Cisco Cloud Services Platform 2100 Hardware Installation Guide.
Choose a hostname for your Cisco CSP 2100.
Obtain the following information about the Cisco CSP 2100 from your network administrator:
Physical network interface card (pNIC) number to be used as the management interface
Management IP address (appears as the mgmt0 interface on the platform)
Netmask for the management interface
Default gateway IP address
Domain name server (DNS) (optional)
Domain name
Password for the admin user
Procedure
Step 1   Turn on the Cisco CSP 2100.
Step 2   Enter admin as the username and admin as the password.
Step 3   Enter the pNIC interface number that you want to use for the management interface. The Linux naming convention designates the four 1-GB Ethernet ports as enp4s0f0, enp4s0f1, enp4s0f2, and enp4s0f3 and the two 10-GB Ethernet ports as enp7s0f0 and enp7s0f1. In addition, there are two 1-GB onboard Ethernet interfaces named enp1s0f0 and enp1s0f1.
Note   
We recommend that you choose one of the 1-GB Ethernet ports as the management interface, so that you can use the higher bandwidth interface for services.
Step 4   Enter yes or no to specify the shared or dedicated mode for the management pNIC:
If you want to share the management pNIC with service VMs, enter yes. The pNIC carries the traffic for the management port and any service using this pNIC.
If you do not want to share the management with service VMs, enter no. The pNIC carries the traffic only for the management port.
Step 5   Enter yes to save the settings.
Step 6   Enter a password for the admin user and then enter the password again for verification.
Step 7   Enter the hostname.
Step 8   Enter the IP address of the management interface.
Step 9   Enter the netmask of the management interface.
Step 10   Enter the IP address of the default gateway.
Step 11   For the DNS, do one of the following:
If you do not have a DNS, enter no and proceed to the next step.
If you have a DNS, enter yes and enter the IP address of the DNS.
Step 12   Enter the domain name; for example, cisco.com.
Step 13   Enter yes to save the settings.
Your specified settings are saved and you are connected to the Cisco CSP 2100 console.
Note   
The config terminal command fails when you run it after performing the initial setup for a new installation. This happens because the admin user is not assigned to a group at the initial login. To run this command and configure Cisco CSP 2100 features, you must log out and then log in to the Cisco CSP 2100.
The following example shows the prompts described in this procedure.
localhost login: admin

Logging In to the Cisco CSP 2100
You can log in to the Cisco CSP 2100 by using one of the following modes: web interface (accessible through a web browser), CLI, or REST APIs (accessible through cURL tool or Windows PowerShell). However, before logging in to the web interface or using the REST APIs, you must install an SSL certificate using the CLI. For detailed information about the CLI and available commands, see the Cisco Cloud Services Platform 2100 Command Reference Guide.
Generating and Installing an SSL Certificate

Note
For proof-of-concept (POC) or lab deployments, an SSL certificate is not required. You can skip this section and go to Accessing the Cisco CSP 2100 Web Interface.
You must generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to send to a Certification Authority (CA) to obtain an SSL certificate and use the CLI to install the SSL certificate on Cisco CSP 2100. The default self-signed certificate installed on the Cisco CSP 2100 is only for temporary use.
Procedure
Step 1   Log in to the Cisco CSP 2100 CLI in EXEC mode.
Step 2   On the command prompt, use the following command to create a CSR:
csp# certificate request sha sha256 keysize 2048
After you enter the command, you are prompted for some information such as country name, state, city, email, common name, and so on. For detailed information about this command, see the Cisco Cloud Services Platform 2100 Command Reference Guide.
Note   
The common name is the DNS name of the host, including the domain name; for example, myserver.mycompany.com.
Step 3   Provide the required information in the prompt.
After you provide the required information, the following two files are generated in the /osp/certificates directory:
myhost.csr—The server certificate request file
myPrivate.key—The server key file
Note   
To enable the Cisco CSP 2100 to start without entering a password, the myPrivate.key file is not protected with a passphrase. However, you can use a passphrase to protect it. When the myPrivate.key file is protected with a passphrase, the administrator must enter the password every time the Cisco CSP 2100 starts.
Step 4   Send the myhost.csr file to a CA to obtain an SSL certificate.
After you submit the CSR to a CA, the CA generates an SSL certificate and sends a certificate file to you. The CA may also send a certificate chain file.
Step 5   Copy the SSL certificate files that you received from the CA to the /osp/certificates directory using the scp command from an external server.
Step 6   On the Cisco CSP 2100 command prompt, enter the following command to install the certificate:
csp# certificate install-certificate 
After you enter the command, you are prompted for some information such as localhost (hostname including the domain name), key filename, certificate filename, and chain filename. For detailed information about this command, see the Cisco Cloud Services Platform 2100 Command Reference Guide.
Step 7   Provide the required information in the prompt.
After you provide the required information, the SSL certificate is installed.
To verify that the certificate is installed, follow the instructions in the next section to log in to the Cisco CSP 2100 web interface using a web browser. After logging in, click the lock icon in the address bar to see information about the installed certificate.
Accessing the Cisco CSP 2100 Web Interface
Procedure
Step 1   Enter https://hostname or https://ip-address in a web browser.
Note   
The hostname should resolve to the IP address that you entered as the management IP address in Step 5 of Performing the Initial Setup. The hostname should also match the hostname specified in Step 2 of Generating and Installing an SSL Certificate.
Step 2   Enter the username admin and the password.
The Cisco CSP 2100 web interface is displayed.
