    Video traffic continues to grow rapidly. It would take more than 5 million years to watch the amount of video that will cross global IP networks each month in 2021. Every second, a million minutes of video content will cross the network. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) will carry 71 percent of Internet traffic by 2021. Content providers will need to scale their networks at speed to keep up with the demand for more video. Networks needs to be designed with “web-scale” in mind. A web-scale network needs to scale at deployment speed while being operationally simple. Network Convergence System 1004 uses state of the art silicon along with complete automation and real-time visibility to deliver a universal transponder solution that provides best-in-class performance for metro, long-haul and submarine applications while being simple to deploy and manage.
Product overview
The Cisco NCS 1004 (Figure 1) is a 2RU system, mechanically optimized to maximize capacity at minimum space and power footprint. The system uses a Linux kernel with the 64 bit IOS XR OS in a Linux Container (LxC) and admin plane operating in a separate LxC. It encompasses carrier-class software with a number of features such as machine-to-machine APIs based on YANG data models, streaming telemetry agent for real time, granular device monitoring and also an infrastructure for 3rd party applications.
The NCS 1004 has two redundant and field replaceable AC & DC power supply units and three redundant and field replaceable fans. It also provides a field replaceable controller card (Figure 1). The NCS 1004 has one main SSD removable from CPU controller unit which is field replaceable. In addition, a local non-removeable backup SSD is provided to store backup XR images and system customer configuration. Each NCS 1004 chassis provide four line card slots.

Features and benefits
NCS 1004 has a front to back airflow scheme. The air inlet is at the front side of the chassis and the exhaust is on the rear side. This ensures that the airflow is not obstructed or impeded by any object as it may lead to reduced airflow in the system, causing components to operate at a higher temperature. The controller is on the front side and the PSUs and the fan units are on the rear side of the chassis. NCS1004 can host upto 4xsingle slot NCS1004 line cards, but has been designed also to accommodate 2xdouble-high line cards.
Management
The Cisco NCS 1004 provides comprehensive management capabilities to support Operations, Administration, Maintenance, and Provisioning (OAM&P) through IOS-XR CLI, SNMP, Syslog, and XML. In addition, iPXE for automated software download and Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) for automated configuration download are available for simplified installation. For machine-to-machine configuration and management of NCS 1004, NETCONF, RESTCONF and gRPC transport protocols with JSON, XML and GPB encoding are provided. OpenConfig protocols for management GNMI and operations GNOI are also supported. The NCS 1004 provides a set of native YANG models as well as the ability to map into any industry standard or customer defined YANG data models. For monitoring, NCS 1004 provides a streaming telemetry feature that relies on a push mechanism to disseminate user selected PM and status information at user specified frequencies at granular 10 second intervals. This improves monitoring speed and scale compared to traditional pull based mechanisms such as SNMP. The telemetry infrastructure also allows for events such as alarms, port-state changes to be notified.
The NCS 1004 can also support third party application hosting. Such an application can be hosted in a container or docker and can perform provisioning and monitoring on the NCS 1004.
Headless Operation
The headless operation allows for NCS 1004 data plane to operate errorless during software upgrades and when the controller card is either physically absent or in a failed state. The fault propagation will continue to operate for client and trunk failures without the presence of the controller module.
