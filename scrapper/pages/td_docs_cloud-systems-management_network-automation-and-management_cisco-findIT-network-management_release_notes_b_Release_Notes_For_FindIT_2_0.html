Introduction
These release notes describe the recommended practices and known issues that apply to software version 2.0.0 of Cisco FindIT Network Manager and Cisco FindIT Network Probe.
What's New in Cisco FindIT Network Manager & Probe, Release 2.0.0
Cisco FindIT Network Manager and Probe release 2.0.0 introduces the following new features and changes:
The Probe management functionality has been migrated to the Manager. This has the following impact:
All network management is performed through the Manager GUI. There is no longer any reason to access the Probe GUI for day to day operations.
The device inventory contains all devices from all networks and may be filtered to display devices with common characteristics regardless of which network they are located in.
Configuration profiles and device groups may be applied across multiple networks.
Reports span all networks.
The Network Plug and Play feature is now integrated with the inventory, meaning that a device deployed using PnP will be automatically correlated with the same device discovered by a Probe.
FindIT Network Manager now supports the concept of Organizations. Organizations allow networks and configuration data to be divided based on administrative characteristics (For example, end customer identity, department or region). Access to network and configuration information may now be restricted to a subset of organizations on a per-user basis.
The wireless reports have been enhanced to display data visually and be more interactive
The wireless reports now keep historical data for up to two years
The dashboard has been reworked to provide simpler and more flexible customization and layout. Dashboard widgets are now more interactive.
Controls have been added allowing the user to individually enable and disable features that require sharing data with Cisco.
Software images have been cryptographically signed to prevent tampering.
Manager scalability is now based on the total number of devices under management, not the number of networks. This allows the Manager to support a larger number of networks with smaller average device counts.
Numerous small user experience improvements have been made.
System Requirements for Cisco FindIT Network Manager
Cisco FindIT Network Manager is distributed as a virtual machine image, as an installer for use with the Ubuntu Linux distribution, and is available for Amazon Web Services (AWS) through the AWS Marketplace (https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace).

Cisco Supported Devices
FindIT Network Manager supports the Cisco 100 to 500 series products. For a detailed list of devices and features supported, please refer to the Cisco FindIT Network Manager - Device Support List.
License Requirements
FindIT Network Manager is a licensed application. Device licenses are required for each Cisco 100 to 500 series product being managed. A count of up to ten Cisco 100 to 500 series devices may be managed in Evaluation Mode without a license. For more information, please refer to the FindIT Network Manager Datasheet page.
Upgrading to Cisco FindIT 2.0.0 from 1.1.x
To upgrade from FindIT Network Manager or Probe version 1.1.x to version 2.0.0, do the following:
On the Manager, click About FindIT
Select the radio button next to the Manager update and click Upgrade. The Manager will download and apply the update and then restart
Log back on to the Manager, click About FindIT again
Select the radio button next to the Probe update and click Upgrade. Each Probe will download and apply the update and then restart
When upgrading from 1.1.x to 2.0.0, the following changes will be made during the upgrade process:
Each Network Plug and Play Project will be converted to a network and a device group with names corresponding to the project name prefixed with PnP
Device Groups defined on each probe are moved to the manager and the group name is prefixed with the name of the network
Network and System configuration profiles will be moved to the manager
In addition, certain information previously stored on the Probe will not be migrated to the Manager:
Device credentials defined in the Add New Credentials section of the Device Credentials page will not be migrated to the Manager. However, any device that has working credentials assigned will continue to have those credentials assigned after the upgrade.
Device configuration backups will not be retained through the upgrade. Backups should be downloaded to the local PC prior to performing the upgrade.
Floorplans will be lost during the upgrade.
Any dashboard customization will be lost during the upgrade.

Note
Probe configuration will only be migrated to the manager if the probe upgrade is triggered through the manager user interface. If the probe upgrade is triggered from the probe user interface, or the probe is manually upgraded by running the linux installer on the probe platform, the configuration migration process will not take place.
Support for 1.1.x Probes with a 2.0.0 Manager
FindIT Network Manager 2.0.0 provides limited support for FindIT Network Probe version 1.1.x to allow upgrades to be gradually deployed across the network. Selecting the network and clicking Manage opens the Probe GUI in a new window giving the same experience as with a version 1.1.x manager. The network may then be managed through the probe user interface as normal. Please note that any changes to the network name or location in the Probe user interface will not be reflected in the Manager user interface.
In addition to the ability to access the probe user interface directly, the following functionality is available from the Manager user interface:
Viewing device information through the inventory is supported for networks with probe version 1.1.x
The Lifecycle, End of Life and Maintenance reports include devices from networks with probe version 1.1.x
The Event Log displays events for networks with probe version 1.1.x
The probe may be upgraded to version 2.0.0 from the manager user interface
Limitations and Restrictions
The Cisco FindIT Network limitations and restrictions are described in the following sections:
General Limitations
System Backup and Restore
General Limitations
The web interface on FindIT Network Manager takes a few minutes to become operational after the application is started
Depending on the size of the network, it may take the Probe several minutes to discover all devices and calculate the network topology
Up to 50 network devices can be managed by single Probe instance
Up to 2500 devices can be managed by a single Manager instance
SNMPv3 authentication keys and privacy keys must be at least 8 characters in length
When using Safari, ensure that the certificate presented by the FindIT Network Probe is set to Always Trust
System Backup and Restore
When performing a system backup or restore, FindIT will prevent you from doing any further configuration actions
Prior to beginning a system backup or restore, the idle timeout value in Administration > User Management > User Session Settings should be set to at least 30 minutes (default is 60 minutes)
Caveats
The following table lists the open caveats for version 2.0.0
