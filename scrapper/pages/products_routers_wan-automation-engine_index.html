Cisco WAN Automation Engine (WAE)
Operational excellence for your network
WAE is a network design and planning tool used to visualize and optimize networks. The network abstraction contains all relevant information, including topology, configuration, and traffic details. Users leverage WAE to model, simulate and analyze failures, design changes, and the impact of traffic growth.

Features and benefits
  Visibility
See graphical layouts of the network, showing views of different regions and layers, as well as traffic utilization and how it is routed.
“What-if” predictive analysis
Simulate availability and failure scenarios to predict the impact of planned and unplanned events considering traffic flows, IGP/EGP routing protocols, Quality of Service, Segment Routing, IP over Optical (L1), etc.
Capacity planning
Comprehensive forecasting based on traffic trends, external network influences, regional growth, and other network inputs.
Path routing optimization
WAE can consider various traffic profiles and advanced services (VPN, multicast, etc.) in recommending optimal paths for Segment routing and/or MPLS.
WAE Architecture
WAE Server
The collector can leverage SNMP, BGP-LS, NetFlow, SR-PCE, OSPF LSD, etc., to collect data and build abstracted network models (also known as Plan files).
WAE Design
Using WAE Design you can retrieve a network model from the WAE server and view the topology. You can quickly filter and drill down, simulate “what if” scenarios and run tools to evaluate potential risks, find optimal paths/IGP metrics or suggest changes in capacity.
WAE Live
WAE Live is a web-based application that provides visibility into the network infrastructure, state, and traffic utilization. WAE Live provides immediate and easy access to both current and historical network data.
