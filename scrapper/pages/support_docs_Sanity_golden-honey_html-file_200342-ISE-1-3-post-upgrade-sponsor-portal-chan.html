Introduction
This document describes the methods for accessing the sponsor portal after upgrading to Identity Services Engine (ISE) version 1.3 and higher from versions 1.2 and lower.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have basic knowledge of these topics:
ISE guest configuration
Certificates
Components Used
The information in this document is based on ISE version 1.3 and above.
Problem - ISE 1.2 sponsor portal URL is invalid after upgrade
ISE 1.3 introduced changes to the configuration of guest and sponsor portals.
One of these changes is the ability to configure multiple sponsor portals.
As a result, the ISE 1.2 URL https://ise-psn:8443/sponsorportal does not fetch the sponsor portal anymore.
Solution 1 - Use the test portal URL
The current URL to refer to the sponsor portal can be found here:
Navigate to Guest Access > Configure > Sponsor Portals > [Select portal]
Click on the portal test URL
This will take you to a page with a link similar to:
https://ise-psn:8443/sponsorportal/PortalSetup.action?portal=1a745890-5e4e-11e4-b905-005056bf2f0a
The new URL has an added parameter, a portal ID, referencing the portal that needs to be opened.
This link can be distributed to the sponsors and can be used for all sponsor portal related activities.
Solution 2 - Use the sponsor portal name
A sponsor portal can also be accessed via a URL in this format:
https://ise-psn:8443/sponsorportal/PortalSetup.action?portal=url-encoded-portal-name
An example:
The default sponsor portal is: Sponsor Portal (default)
The corresponding URL would be: https://ise-psn:8443/sponsorportal/PortalSetup.action?portal=Sponsor+Portal+%28default%29/
A URL encoding tool like w3schools can be used to encode special characters in the URL correctly.
Solution 3 - Use a sponsor portal FQDN
The limitation of solutions 1 and 2 is that the URL is long and difficult to remember. It needs to be saved or bookmarked and referenced each time. This solution aims at a simple and long term fix to the problem.
This is done by configuring a Fully Qualifed Domain Name (FQDN) unique to the sponsor portal.
Navigate to Guest Access > Configure > Sponsor Portals > [Select portal] and scroll down till you see a text box with an option to configure an FQDN:


FQDN requirements
The FQDN must be different from the FQDN of all ISE nodes.
This FQDN should resolve to only the Policy Service Nodes(PSNs) in the deployment.
The admin and portal certificates should have this FQDN in their Subject Alternative Name(SAN) field.
Once these conditions are met, type in the FQDN in the text box and save the portal configuration.
The portal can now be accessed by simply browsing to https://FQDN/ or http://FQDN/
Considerations for Portal certificate
A new feature also introduced in ISE 1.3 is that the portal and admin certificates can be different.
You can have different certificates for different portals as well, by assigning a unique tag to each portal certificate and calling these tags under the respective portals.
When using solution 3, you will be browsing to https://FQDN/ where FQDN is mapped to a sponsor portal and resolves to one of the PSNs. Therefore, this is a connection on port 443 to the PSN.
Since port 443 is the admin port, the PSN will present its admin certificate to the browser.
When the client requests the sponsor portal FQDN in the GET request, the PSN redirects it to the appropriate portal URL on port 8443 and the corresponding portal certificate is presented.
Therefore, despite using different certificates for admin and portal, you still need to include the portal FQDN in both of them.
Alternatively, you will need to enforce browsing to http://FQDN/. This too will redirect to the corresponding sponsor portal. Since the initial connection is on HTTP, the admin certificate is not used.
