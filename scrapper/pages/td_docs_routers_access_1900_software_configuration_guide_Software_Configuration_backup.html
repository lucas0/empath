Chapter: Configuring Backup Data Lines and Remote Management
Chapter Contents
Cisco 3900 series, Cisco 2900 series, and Cisco 1900 series integrated services routers (ISRs) support remote management and backup data connectivity by means of ISDN.
The following sections describe how to configure backup data lines and remote management:
Configuring Backup Interfaces
Configuring Dial Backup and Remote Management Through the Console Port or Auxiliary Port
Configuring Data Line Backup and Remote Management Through the ISDN S/T Port
Configuring Third-Party SFPs
Configuring Backup Interfaces
This section contains the following topics:
Configuring the Backup Interface
Configuring Gigabit Ethernet Failover Media
Configuring Cellular Dial-on-Demand Routing Backup
Configuring the Backup Interface
When the router receives an indication that the primary interface is down, the backup interface is enabled. After the primary connection is restored for a specified period, the backup interface is disabled.
Note For dial-on-demand routing (DDR) backup, even if the backup interface comes out of standby mode, the router does not enable the backup interface unless the router receives the traffic specified for that backup interface.
To configure the router with a backup interface, follow these steps, beginning in global configuration mode.
SUMMARY STEPS
1. interface type number
2. backup interface interface-type interface-number
3. backup delay enable-delay disable-delay
4. exit
DETAILED STEPS
  Command
Purpose
Step 1
interface type number
  Router(config)# interface atm 0/0/0
Router(config-if)#
Enters interface configuration mode for the interface for which you want to configure backup.
The example shows configuration of a backup interface for an ATM WAN connection.
Step 2
backup interface interface-type interface-number
  Router(config-if)# backup interface bri 0/0/1
Router(config-if)#
Assigns an interface as the secondary or backup interface.
This can be a serial interface or an asynchronous interface. For example, a serial 1 interface could be configured to back up a serial 0/2/1 interface.
The example shows a BRI interface configured as the backup interface for the ATM 0/0/0 interface.
Step 3
backup delay enable-delay disable-delay
  Router(config-if)# backup delay enable delay
Specifies the delay between the physical interface going down and the backup interface being enabled, and the delay between the physical interface coming back up and the backup interface being disabled.
Step 4
exit
  Router(config-if)# exit
Router(config)#
Exits configuration interface mode.
Configuring Gigabit Ethernet Failover Media
Cisco 2921, Cisco 2951, and Cisco 3900 Series routers provide a Gigabit Ethernet (GE) small-form-factor pluggable (SFP) port that supports copper and fiber concurrent connections. Media can be configured for failover redundancy when the network goes down.
Note Do not connect back-to-back Cisco 2921, Cisco 2951, or Cisco 3900 Series routers with failover or as auto-detect configured. This is not a supported configuration and the behavior is unpredictable.
Assigning Primary and Secondary Failover Media
To assign primary and secondary failover media on the GE-SFP port, follow these steps, beginning in EXEC mode.
SUMMARY STEPS
1. configure terminal
2. interface gigabitethernet slot/port
3. media-type sfp
4. media-type sfp auto-failover
5. end
DETAILED STEPS
  Command
Purpose
Step 1
configure terminal
  Router> enable
Router# configure terminal
Router(config)#
Enters global configuration mode, when using the console port.
Use the following commands to connect to the router with a remote terminal:
telnet router name or address
Login: login id
Password: *********
Router> enable
Step 2
interface gigabitethernet slot/port
  Router(config)# interface gigabitethernet 0/1
Router(config-if)#
Enters interface configuration mode.
Step 3
media-type sfp
  Router(config-if)# media-type sfp
Router(config-if)#
  Router(config-if)# media-type rj45
Router(config-if)#
Designates SFP port as the primary media.
OR
Designates RJ-45 as the primary media.
Step 4
media-type sfp auto-failover
  Router(config-if)# media-type sfp auto-failover
Router(config-if)#
  Router(config-if)# media-type rj45 auto-failover
Router(config-if)#
Configures the port with SFP as the primary media for automatic failover from SFP to RJ-45.
OR
Configures the port with RJ-45 as the primary media for automatic failover from RJ-45 to SFP.
Step 5
end
Exits to global configuration mode.
Enabling Auto-Detect
The Auto-Detect feature is enabled if media-type is not configured. This feature automatically detects which media is connected and links up. If both media are connected, whichever media comes up first is linked up.
Note The Auto-Detect feature only works with 1 GigE SFPs. This feature does not detect 100M SFPs.
Use the no media-type command in interface configuration mode to enable the Auto-Detect feature.
To configure the Auto-Detect feature, follow these steps, beginning in global configuration mode.
SUMMARY STEPS
1. configure terminal
2. interface gigabitethernet slot/port
3. no media-type
DETAILED STEPS
  Command
Purpose
Step 1
configure terminal
  Router# configure terminal
Router(config)#
Enters global configuration mode.
Step 2
interface gigabitethernet slot/port
  Router(config)# interface gigabitethernet 0/1
Router(config-if)#
Enters interface configuration mode.
Step 3
no media-type
  Router(config-if)# no media-type
GigabitEthernet0/1: Changing media to UNKNOWN.
You may need to update the speed and duplex settings for this interface.
Enables Auto-Detect. If a 1 GigE SFP is plugged in, set the speed as 1000 and duplex as full. An RJ45 connection only works with speed as 1000 and duplex as full. If a SFP is not plugged in, all speeds and duplexes are available for the RJ45 media.
Note Do not set speed as 100 or 10 and duplex as half if a 1 GigE SFP is plugged in. SFP behavior is unpredictable at these settings.
Configuring Cellular Dial-on-Demand Routing Backup
To monitor the primary connection and initiate the backup connection over the cellular interface when needed, the router can use one of the following methods:
Backup Interface—Backup interface stays in standby mode until the primary interface line protocol is detected as down; then the backup interface is brought up. See the “Configuring Backup Interfaces” section.
Dialer Watch—Dialer watch is a backup feature that integrates dial backup with routing capabilities. See the “Configuring DDR Backup Using Dialer Watch” section.
Floating Static Route—Route through the backup interface has an administrative distance that is greater than the administrative distance of the primary connection route and therefore is not in the routing table until the primary interface goes down. When the primary interface goes down, the floating static route is used. See the “Configuring DDR Backup Using Floating Static Route” section.
Cellular Wireless Modem—To configure the 3G wireless modem as backup with Network Address Translation (NAT) and IPSec on either Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) or code division multiple access (CDMA) networks, see “Cellular Wireless Modem as Backup with NAT and IPSec Configuration” section.
Note You cannot configure a backup interface for the cellular interface or any other asynchronous serial interface.
Configuring DDR Backup Using Dialer Watch
To initiate dialer watch, you must configure the interface to perform dial-on-demand routing (DDR) and backup. Use traditional DDR configuration commands, such as dialer map, for DDR capabilities. To enable dialer watch on the backup interface and create a dialer list, use the following commands in interface configuration mode.
SUMMARY STEPS
1. configure terminal
2. interface type number
3. dialer watch group group-number
4. dialer watch-list group-number ip ip-address address-mask
5. dialer-list dialer-group protocol protocol-name {permit | deny | list access-list-number | access-group}
6. ip access-list access list number permit ip source address
7. interface cellular 0
8. dialer string string
DETAILED STEPS
  Command or Action
Purpose
Step 1
configure terminal
  Router# configure terminal
Enters global configuration mode.
Step 2
interface type number
  Router (config)# interface ATM 0
Specifies the interface.
Step 3
dialer watch-group group-number
  Router(config-if)# dialer watch-group 2
Enables dialer watch on the backup interface.
Step 4
dialer watch-list group-number ip ip-address address-mask
  Router(config-if)# dialer watch-list 2 ip 10.4.0.254 255.255.0.0
Defines a list of all IP addresses to be watched.
Step 5
dialer-list dialer-group protocol protocol-name {permit | deny | list access-list-number | access-group}>
  Router(config)# dialer-list 2 protocol ip permit
Creates a dialer list for traffic of interest and permits access to an entire protocol.
Step 6
ip access-list access-list-number permit ip-source-address
  Router(config)# access list 2 permit 10.4.0.0
Defines traffic of interest.
Do not use the access list permit all command to avoid sending traffic to the IP network. This may result in call termination.
Step 7
interface cellular 0
  Router (config)# interface cellular 0
Specifies the cellular interface.
Step 8
dialer string string
or
dialer group dialer-group-number
  Router (config-if)# dialer string cdma *** cdma ***
  Router (config-if)# dialer group 2 *** gsm ***
CDMA only—dialer string string specifies the dialer script. (The dialer script is defined by using the chat script command).
GSM only—dialer group dialer-group-number maps a dialer list to the dialer interface.
Configuring DDR Backup Using Floating Static Route
To configure a floating static default route on the secondary interface, use the following commands, beginning in global configuration mode.
Note Make sure you have IP classless enabled on your router.
SUMMARY STEPS
1. configure terminal
2. ip route network-number network-mask { ip address | interface } [ administrative-distance ] [name name]
DETAILED STEPS
  Command or Action
Purpose
Step 1
configure terminal
  Router# configure terminal
Enters global configuration mode from the terminal.
Step 2
ip route network-number network-mask { ip-address | interface } [ administrative-distance ] [name name ]
  Router (config)# ip route 0.0.0.0 Dialer 2 track 234
Establishes a floating static route with the configured administrative distance through the specified interface.
A higher administrative distance should be configured for the route through the backup interface, so that the backup interface is used only when the primary interface is down.
Cellular Wireless Modem as Backup with NAT and IPSec Configuration
The following example shows how to configure the 3G wireless modem as backup with NAT and IPsec on either GSM or CDMA networks.
Note The receive and transmit speeds cannot be configured. The actual throughput depends on the cellular network service.

Configuring Dial Backup and Remote Management Through the Console Port or Auxiliary Port
When customer premises equipment, such as a Cisco 3900 series ISR, is connected to an ISP, an IP address is dynamically assigned to the router, or the IP address is assigned by the router peer through the centrally managed function. The dial backup feature can be added to provide a failover route in case the primary line fails. Cisco 3900 series ISRs can use the auxiliary port for dial backup and remote management.
Figure 1 shows the network configuration used for remote management access and for providing backup to the primary WAN line.

Configuring Data Line Backup and Remote Management Through the ISDN S/T Port
This section contains the following topics:
Configuring ISDN Settings
Example
Cisco 3900 series routers can use the ISDN S/T port for remote management. Figure 2 and Figure 3 show two typical network configurations that provide remote management access and backup for the primary WAN line.
Figure 2 shows a dial backup link that goes through a customer premises equipment (CPE) splitter, a digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM), and a central office (CO) splitter before connecting to the ISDN switch.

Configuring ISDN Settings
Note Traffic of interest must be present in order to activate the backup ISDN line by means of the backup interface and floating static routes methods. Traffic of interest is not needed in order for the dialer watch to activate the backup ISDN line.
To configure your router ISDN interface for use as a backup interface, follow these steps, beginning in global configuration mode.

Step 1
isdn switch-type switch-type
  Router(config)# isdn switch-type basic-net3
Router(config)#
Specifies the ISDN switch type.
The example specifies a switch type used in Australia, Europe, and the United Kingdom. For details on other supported switch types, see Cisco IOS Dial Technologies Command Reference.
Step 2
interface type number
  Router(config)# interface bri 0
Router(config-if)#
Enters configuration mode for the ISDN BRI.
Step 3
encapsulation encapsulation-type
  Router(config-if)# encapsulation ppp
Router(config-if)#
Sets the BRI0 interface encapsulation type.
Step 4
dialer pool-member number
  Router(config-if)# dialer pool-member 1
Router(config-if)#
Specifies the dialer pool membership.
Step 5
isdn switch-type switch-type
  Router(config-if)# isdn switch-type basic-net3
Router(config-if)#
Specifies the ISDN switch type.
Step 6
exit
  Router(config-if)# exit
Router(config)#
Exits interface configuration mode and enters global configuration mode.
Step 7
interface dialer dialer-rotary-group-number
  Router(config)# interface dialer 0
Router(config-if)#
Creates a dialer interface (numbered 0 to 255) and enters interface configuration mode.
Step 8
ip address negotiated
  Router(config-if)# ip address negotiated
Router(config-if)#
Specifies that the IP address for the interface is obtained through PPP/IPCP (IP Control Protocol) address negotiation. The IP address is obtained from the peer.
Step 9
encapsulation encapsulation-type
  Router(config-if)# encapsulation ppp
Router(config-if)#
Sets the encapsulation type for the interface.
Step 10
dialer pool number
  Router(config-if)# dialer pool 1
Router(config-if)#
Specifies the dialer pool to be used.
In the example, the dialer pool 1 setting associates the dialer 0 interface with the BRI0 interface because the BRI0 dialer pool-member value is 1.
Step 11
dialer string dial-string# [ : isdn-subaddress ]
  Router(config-if)# dialer string 384040
Router(config-if)#
Specifies the telephone number to be dialed.
Step 12
dialer-group group-number
  Router(config-if)# dialer group 1
Router(config-if)#
Assigns the dialer interface to a dialer group (1–10).
Step 13
exit
  Router(config-if)# exit
Router(config)#
Exits dialer interface configuration mode and enters global configuration mode.
Step 14
dialer-list dialer-group protocol protocol-name { permit | deny | list access-list-number | access-group }
  Router(config)# dialer-list 1 protocol ip permit
Router(config)#
Creates a dialer list for packets of interest to be forwarded through the specified interface dialer group.
In the example, dialer-list 1 corresponds to dialer-group 1.
For details about this command and additional parameters that can be set, see Cisco IOS Dial Technologies Command Reference.
Example
The following configuration example configures an aggregated and ISDN peer router.
The aggregator is typically a concentrator router where your Cisco router Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) permanent virtual connection (PVC) terminates. In the following configuration example, the aggregator is configured as a PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) server.
The ISDN peer router is any router that has an ISDN interface and can communicate through a public ISDN network to reach your Cisco router ISDN interface. The ISDN peer router provides Internet access for your Cisco router during the ATM network downtime.
  ! This portion of the example configures the aggregator.

Configuring Third-Party SFPs
Small Form-Factor Pluggables (SFPs) that are not Cisco certified are called third-party SFPs. Cisco approved means the SFPs have undergone rigorous testing with Cisco products and the SFPs are guaranteed to have 100% compatibility.
Third-party SFPs are manufactured by companies that are not on the Cisco-approved Vendor List (AVL). Currently, Cisco ISR G2 routers support only Cisco-approved SFPs. From Release 15.3(2)T, Cisco ISR G2 routers recognize third-party SFPs.
Note Cisco does not provide any kind of support for the third-party SFPs because they are not validated by Cisco.
Restrictions
Supports only 100BASE SFPs and 1000BASE SFPs under two speed configurations:
100 Mbps speed for 100BASE SFPs
1000 Mbps speed for 1000BASE SFPs
Only the following routers and modules support third-party SFPs:
Cisco 2921 Integrated Services Router
Cisco 2951 Integrated Services Router
Cisco 3900 Integrated Services Router
Cisco 3900E Series Integrated Services Routers
Cisco 892-F Gigabit Ethernet Security Router
Cisco 898-EA Gigabit Ethernet Security Router

Note For 100BASE SFPs, configure the speed to 100 Mbps only. Similarly, for 1000BASE SFPs, configure the speed to 1000 Mbps only.
Step 7
shutdown
  Router(config-if)# shutdown
Disables the interface, changing its state from administratively UP to administratively DOWN.
Step 8
no shutdown
  Router(config-if)# no shutdown
Enables the interface, changing its state from administratively DOWN to administratively UP.
Step 9
exit
  Router(config-if)# exit
