Note
The method used to calculate ASA differs based on the type of system associated with the reporting object Webex CCE). The following table shows the calculations. X means that the value is included in the calculation.

ASA for Agent and Skill Group
Agent. The ASA is calculated for the agent at the PG level.
The internal queuing time is sent to the PG by Webex CCE when an agent becomes available for the call. The PG adds up the internal queue time, ring time, and network time and adds that into AnswerWaitTime in the agent skill group table. AnswerWaitTime is then divided by the CallsAnswered for the agent.
skill group. The ASA is calculated for the skill group at the PG level.
For Webex CCE Enterprise Queuing, the time spent in the enterprise queue is not used in the calculation of AnswerWaitTime. The calculation includes the ACD queue time only.
For ACD queuing, the queue time is reported by the PG based on events received from the ACD.
Consider this example:
A call is queued at skill group X.
At Time T, the call is then queued at skill group Y at time T+30 seconds.
An additional 10 seconds transpire before the call is answered by an agent at skill group Y.
In this case, the internal queuing time will be 40 seconds. This is the total length that the call has been queued even though it was only queued at skill group Y for 10 seconds.
The agent's PG adds the internal queue time, ring time, and network time to create the total AnswerWaitTime for the call and adds it to AnswerWaitTime in the skill group table. AnswerWaitTime is then divided by CallsAnswered within the skill group table to arrive at the ASA for the skill group.
Precision queue. The ASA is calculated for the precision queue by summing skill groups across PGs which are associated with the precision queue.

ASA for Call Type and Service
The call type ASA is calculated as AnswerWaitTime divided by CallsAnswered.
Call type ASA is applicable only when calls are translation routed and includes time spent in the Enterprise Queue as well as time spent in the ACD queue.
ASA for the service is computed based on the AnswerWaitTime as reported from the peripheral. This value includes the time spent on the ACD after the call was offered up until the time the call was answered. If an Enterprise Queue is used, ASA reported for the service does not include time spent in the Enterprise Queue.
