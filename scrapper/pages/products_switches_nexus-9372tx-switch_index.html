Performance and Scale in a Small Form Factor
The Cisco Nexus 9372TX/9327TX-E Switch offers a line-rate layer 2 and layer 3 feature set in a compact form factor. It offers a flexible switching platform for both 3-tier and spine-leaf architectures as a leaf node. With the option to operate in Cisco NX-OS or Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode, it can be deployed within small business, enterprise, and service provider architectures.
