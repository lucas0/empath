Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCvw68741 DCNM 7.x Release wont support be supported on browsers due to Flash support going away
Problem Description
Data Center Network Manager 7.X releases listed in the Products Affected section require Adobe Flash, and full functionality requires that Adobe Flash be installed on the system and that Flash-based content is enabled. Some functionality might no longer work after 2020-12-31.
Background
In accordance with Adobe’s End-of-Life announcement, Adobe might block Flash-based content and will no longer distribute or support Flash software after 2020-12-31. In addition, third-party software updates from operating system vendors and/or browser vendors might also block Flash-based content after 2020-12-31.
Even if Flash-based content works normally after 2020-12-31, the lack of Flash maintenance updates from Adobe introduces various levels of risk that administrators should evaluate.
Cisco has migrated from Flash to alternate technologies. Refer to the Workaround/Solution section for specific details on this product.
Problem Symptom
After 2020-12-31, if Adobe Flash-based content is blocked or if Flash cannot be downloaded or installed, affected products might lose full functionality.
If Adobe Flash-based content is enabled on a system with Flash already installed, affected products might or might not continue to operate normally after 2020-12-31, depending on the organization’s operating system and browser environments.
The Adobe Flash interface is no longer usable after 2020-12-31. The End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager 7.x and earlier concludes that Adobe Flash will not be supported.
All Java interfaces will continue to function.
Workaround/Solution
Upgrade to Release 11.4.1 or later. Customers can download DCNM Release 11.
Release 11.4.1 or later is the recommended release for customers to upgrade to the 11.x train.
