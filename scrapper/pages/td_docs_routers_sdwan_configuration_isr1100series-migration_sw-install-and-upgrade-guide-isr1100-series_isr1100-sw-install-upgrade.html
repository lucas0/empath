Overview
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.4.1a introduces Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN support for Cisco ISR1100 and ISR1100X Series Integrated Services Routers. This provides these devices with a new flexibility. They can use Cisco vEdge software and operate as a Cisco vEdge device, or they can use Cisco IOS XE Release 17.4.1a or later and operate as a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device.
You can use the upgrade procedures in this section to change the software on a Cisco ISR1100 Series device from Cisco vEdge software to Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN, or from Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN to Cisco vEdge software.
Supported Platforms
Cisco ISR1100-4G
Ciscoo ISR1100X-4G
Cisco ISR1100-6G
Cisco ISR1100X-6G
Cisco ISR1100-4GLTE (Cisco ISR1100-4GLTENA and Cisco ISR1100-4GLTEGB )
Use Cases for Updating a Device to Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN or to Cisco vEdge Software
If a device has already been onboarded and is currently running Cisco vEdge software, you can upgrade to Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN.
If a device has not yet been onboarded, then by default, when you upload the device serial file in Cisco vManage, Cisco vManage creates a database entry for the device identifying it as a Cisco vEdge device. In this scenario, you can:
Onboard the device with Cisco vEdge software and continue to use the device as a Cisco vEdge device.
or
Use Cisco vManage to update the device to Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN. Updating to Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN changes the database entry for the device to identify it as a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device.
Notes
When Cisco vManage onboards a Cisco ISR1100 and ISR1100X Series router, by default Cisco vManage treats it as a device running Cisco vEdge software. Cisco vManage indicates the software of Cisco ISR1100 and ISR1100X Series routers in the devices list. To view the device list, in Cisco vManage, click Configuration > Devices.

Detach any device template
In Cisco vManage, if a device template has been applied to the device that you are upgrading, detach the device template.
Configuration file
Typically, the upgrade procedure automatically creates a configuration file for the new software. This configuration file preserves the following basic device configuration from the existing configuration file:
System IP
Physical WAN interface name
Cisco vBond IP
Site ID
Organization name
Static default routes
Hostname IP configurations
DNS (primary/seconday) IP configurations
WAN IP/Netmask (IPv4)
However, in some cases, it may be necessary to create a configuration file manually. See Create the Cisco IOS XE Configuration File Manually for Upgrading a Cisco ISR1100 and ISR1100X Series Router.
Upgrade to Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN
If you are creating the configuration file for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN manually, see Create the Cisco IOS XE Configuration File Manually for Upgrading a Cisco ISR1100 and ISR1100X Series Router.
In Cisco vManage, click Configuration > Devices to view devices in the network. For Cisco ISR1100 Series routers, the table of devices shows the current software. Locate the device that you want to upgrade and note its system IP address.
In Cisco vManage, click Maintenance > Software Upgrade.
Locate the router in the table, using the system IP address noted earlier.
Select the router in the table and click Upgrade.
In the Software Upgrade pop-up:
Select the vManage option.
In the Version field, select the Cisco IOS XE image to use for the upgrade.
The image must be for Cisco IOS XE Release 17.4.1a or later.
Select the Activate and Reboot and Confirm checkboxes.
Click Upgrade. The Task View page displays progress. The device reboots at the end of the upgrade process.
The process takes several minutes.
In the Task View, verify that the device is accessible. If Cisco vManage can reach the device, then the upgrade is considered successful.
Messages on the Task View page show the status:
Message
Description
Operation status being verified by vManage
Cisco vManage is attempting to connect to the device. This message may continue for several minutes.
Note 
If the device is not configured to use Cisco PnP, confirm that you have loaded the device configuration correctly.
Done – Software Install
The upgrade is complete.
In Cisco vManage, click Configuration > Devices and select the WAN Edge List tab.
In the table row for the upgraded device, click More Actions (…) and select Migrate Device. A warning pop-up appears, indicating that the upgrade clears the existing statistics, event history, and configuration. Click Yes to continue.
On the Configuration page, click Refresh. In the Device Model column, verify that the device shows the correct software, according to the migration.
If you migrated the device to Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN, it says Cisco OS.
If you migrated the device to Cisco vEdge software, it says Viptela OS.
After the upgrade, the device uses the configuration file to start up, and re-establishes a control connection to Cisco vManage. If the device is unable to automatically generate the configuration file, the device attempts a PnP workflow after upgrading to Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN to re-establish a control connection to Cisco vManage.
The device operates as any other device running the selected software. Optionally, you can use Cisco vManage to push a device template to add additional configuration to the device.

Note
If the upgrade process fails, Cisco vManage returns the device to its previous software, reloads the previous configuration, and re-establishes the previous connection to the Cisco SD-WAN controller.
Create the Cisco IOS XE Configuration File Manually for Upgrading a Cisco ISR1100 and ISR1100X Series Router

Note
Use this procedure only in cases where it is necessary to create the configuration file manually before the upgrade procedure.
It may be necessary to create a configuration file manually, in the format of the software to which you are upgrading the router, in the following cases:
If the active WAN interface is a non-physical interface.
If Cisco Network Plug and Play (PnP) cannot be used.
If you need to preserve aspects of a complex configuration file that are not converted automatically by the upgrade procedure.
If a loopback interface or extended TLOC is used for the connection between the device and the controller.
Before upgrading a device to Cisco IOS XE, create a bootstrap file called ciscomigration.cfg containing any configuration details that you want to preserve from the current device configuration. This file must contain the full Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN running-config for the router to use after the upgrade procedure.
See Example Bootstrap Configuration Files.

Note
If the ciscomigration.cfg file is empty, it forces a Cisco Plug and Play (PnP) workflow on the device after upgrading to Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN. PnP attempts to connect the device to Cisco vManage.
Do one of the following:
Use a USB flash drive: Copy the file to the root folder of a USB flash drive and connect the USB flash drive to the router.
or
Copy the file by SSH: Connect to the router using SSH (in Cisco vManage, click Tools > SSH Terminal) and transfer the file to the following directory on the router:
/home/admin
Proceed with the upgrade procedure in Cisco vManage. See Upgrade a Cisco ISR1100 and ISR1100X Series Router to Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN. The procedure checks for the presence of the manually created configuration file (first) on an attached USB flash drive and (second) in the home directory described in the previous step. It finds the configuration file that you created and uses it instead of creating a new configuration file automatically.

Create the Cisco vEdge Configuration File Manually for Upgrading a Cisco ISR1100 and ISR1100X Series Router

Note
Use this procedure only in cases where it is necessary to create the configuration file manually before the upgrade procedure.
It may be necessary to create a configuration file manually, in the format of the software to which you are upgrading the router, in the following cases:
If the active WAN interface is a non-physical interface.
If Cisco Network Plug and Play (PnP) cannot be used.
If you need to preserve aspects of a complex configuration file that are not converted automatically by the upgrade procedure.
If a loopback interface or extended TLOC is used for the connection between the device and the controller.
Before upgrading the device to Cisco vEdge software, create a bootstrap file called vedgemigration.cfg containing any configuration details that you want to preserve from the current device configuration. This file must contain the full Cisco vEdge software running-config for the router to use after the upgrade procedure.
See Example Bootstrap Configuration Files.

Note
If the vedgemigration.cfg file is empty, it forces a Cisco Plug and Play (PnP) workflow on the device after upgrading to Cisco vEdge software. PnP attempts to connect the device to Cisco vManage.
