Objective
This article shows you how to download and install the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client on a Windows Computer.
This article is ONLY applicable to the Cisco Small Business RV34x series routers, not Enterprise products.
Introduction
AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client is a modular endpoint software product. It not only provides Virtual Private Network (VPN) access through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) Internet Key Exchange version2 (IKEv2) but also offers enhanced security through various built-in modules.
AnyConnect Software Version
AnyConnect | 4.10.x (Download latest)
Install AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client
Beginner Information
Step 1
Open a web browser and navigate to the Cisco Software Downloads webpage.
Step 2
In the search bar, start typing 'Anyconnect' and the options will appear. Select AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client v4.x.
Step 3
Download the Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client. Most users will select the AnyConnect Pre-Deployment Package (Windows) option.
The images in this article are for AnyConnect v4.10.x, which was latest version at the time of writing this document.
If you purchased a license and you are unable to download AnyConnect, call Cisco Global Service Relations at +1 919-993-2724. Select option 2. You will need to know your Cisco ID (the one you use to log into Cisco.com) and the sales order number when you call. They will get that situation all straightened out.
Step 4
Navigate Windows File Explorer to the installer file. Double-click Setup.exe to initiate the installation process.
Check your Downloads folder to locate the AnyConnect files. Browser based downloads are often deposited into the downloads folder on your device on windows. The path to the file often resembles C:\Users\[Your User ID]\Downloads with the C:/ referring to your devices storage drive.
Step 5
A pop-up window may ask for permissions, in this case, select Yes. If your pop-up asks if you are sure you want to run this software, select Run.
Step 6
Check the check boxes for the modules that you need to install.
Core & VPN - Includes AnyConnect core client with VPN capability.
Start Before Login - User sees the AnyConnect GUI logon dialog before the Windows logon dialog box appears.
Network Access Manager - It is a client software that provides a secure Layer 2 network.
VPN Posture (Hostscan) - Provides the client the ability to identify the operating system, anti-virus, anti-spyware, and firewall software installed on the host.
AMP Enabler - It is used as a medium for deploying Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for endpoints.
Network Visibility Module - Collects rich flow context from an endpoint on or off premise and provides visibility into network connected devices.
Cloud Web Security - It is an endpoint component that routes HTTP traffic to a Cisco Cloud Web Security scanning proxy.
Umbrella Roaming Security - Provides DNS-layer security when no VPN is active.
ISE Posture - It is similar to VPN Posture; performs a client-side evaluation.
Select All - Selects all modules.
Diagnostic and Reporting Tool - It is used to collect data for troubleshooting AnyConnect installation and connection problems.
All modules will be installed by default unless you manually uncheck the boxes.
Step 7
(Optional) Check the Lock Down Component Services check box if the feature needs to be enabled. Enabling this feature will prevent users from disabling the Windows Web Security service.
In this example, Lock Down Component Services is not enabled.
Step 8
Click Install Selected.
Step 9
Click OK.
Step 10
Carefully review the Supplemental End User License Agreement and then click Accept.
