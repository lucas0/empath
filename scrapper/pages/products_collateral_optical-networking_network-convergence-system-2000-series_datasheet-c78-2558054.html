    Product overview
The Cisco Optical Network Controller (CONC) provides an SDN-compliant domain controller for Cisco optical networks. Using an industry-standard OIF Transport API (T-API) interface over RESTCONF, CONC gives a Hierarchical Controller (HCO) or orchestrator abstracted visibility and control for Cisco Optical Networks. CONC is built on the Cisco Crosswork platform using microservices to allow scaling and alignment with Cisco automation direction and products.
Initial functionality will address network discovery (inventory, topology) and service provisioning. Additional network element types/versions and capabilities are being developed.

●      Automatic patch-cord creation for site aggregation base on CONP imported design
●      Bulk push of optical design data to NCS 1010 devices based on CONP Imported design
●      Collects from network:
◦    Nodes, links, connectivity, inventory, utilization, etc. (calculates network topology)
◦    NCS 1010 Current Alarms and PM data (object operational state in TAPI reflects the alarm status of every object)
●      Compute service requests
◦    Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) functions
◦    Calculate the circuit path (+ optical impairments verification) and establish path
●      Provides abstracted network view and functions on northbound interface
◦    ONC provides the inventory, wavelength services, and topology to hierarchical controller via T-API interface (T-API model version 2.1.3)
◦    ONC receives provisioning information from hierarchical controller via T-API interface
◦    ONC provisions the optical nodes
◦    ONC acknowledges the provisioning to hierarchical controller via T-API interface
●      Co-exists/compliments EPNM (Cisco’s EMS/NMS), HCO, and automation software
  Figure 2.            
CONC alarm list and Node Functional View
Some of the advantages CONC provides are as follows:
●      VM-based deployment with Microservices architecture
●      Industry-standard T-API over RESTCONF (for integration into HCO and variety of orchestrators)
●      Co-existence/integration with EPNM, HCO, and Cisco Automation products
●      OCH-NC provisioning between OLS (Open Line System) Add/Drop endpoints
●      Supports ZR, ZR+ DCO, and transponders
●      Supports Alien wavelengths/with Alien transceiver spec validation (imported from CONC)
●      Supports fix-grid (Mux/Demux) and flex-grid (Colorless ports and/or Colorless-Directionless-Contention-less ports)
●      Supports multi-carrier OHC-NC provisioning for higher spectral efficiency
●      Scale and performance benchmarking were done and CONC 2.0 can scale up to 750 devices (future releases will support thousands of devices)
Cisco Optical Network Controller Architecture
Cisco Optical Network Controller was designed to align with an ACTN (Abstraction and Control of Traffic-Engineered Networks) standard architecture. CONC acts as a Provisioning Network Controller (PNC) in an ACTN as shown in the following figure.
Figure 3.            
ACTN standard architecture
The following figure shows the CONC architecture. The northbound interface allows CONC to interact with any OSS solution, while the south bound allows the monitoring and configuring of Cisco NCS2K (Rel12) and NCS1010 optical devices. Additionally, the Crosswork framework on which CONC exists today provides functions such as user management, logging and monitoring, and the common Kafka bus as well as the underlying platform for HA and scale.
Figure 4.            
Cisco Optical Network Controller architecture
The functions that are created as parts of CONC include the key path computation element (PCE), which is the key to determining optically valid paths in a Cisco optical network. Additional CONC functions include device onboarding, topology, inventory, collector services (to gather information from the network), deployer services (to push information into the network), and capacity to add future applications.
Some architectural advantages of CONC are as follows:
●      Components are designed as microservices and run as docker containers
●      Being packaged as Docker images and launched in K8s pods
●      Being designed to work in a distributed compute environment (future)
The next figure shows the overall architecture for Cisco’s management and automation offering. It is key to understand that CONC is built for and intended to be integrated within a larger SDN OSS management framework.
1.     In the RON use case (but also applicable outside RON), ONC is integrated with the Crosswork Hierarchical Controller (HCO). In this case, HCO is acting as the hierarchical controller providing visibility to the entire network and using the TAPI interface to manage optical devices using CONC as the optical domain controller (understanding the optical inventory and topology, provisioning optical services).
2.     EPNM coexists with CONC, and EPNM provides the NMS/EMS function for Cisco IP and Optical products.
3.     Given that CONC provides an industry-standard TAPI interface over RESTCONF, an HCO or orchestration system can use the topology/inventory and service-provisioning functions as well. To support third-party products, CONC has been integrated with Cisco Hierarchical controller (formerly Sedona NetFusion) – this proves the ability for an OEM product to integrate to CONC over the TAPI interface.
4.     ZTP provisioning of the optical devices can also be done by customers who prefer this option.
5.     The CONP optical network planner tool would provide the necessary configuration files (e.g. XML, JSON) that can be consumed by the CONC controller. The data is then utilized to bulk configure NCS1010 devices in the optical network according with planning data.
6.     Looking at the relationship with EPNM, it is critical to understand that there are network management-related functions that EPNM provides that are independent of CONC but critical for managing a real-world network. If EPNM is not used, these functions need to be provided by some other software product(s). The following figure shows the co-existence of EPNM and CONC. It is important to note that both EPNM and CONC should not be used to provision services in the same network so as to ensure a consistent view of services as well as full visibility.

Overall architecture for management and automation
CONC TAPI interface
CONC’s Northbound Interface (NBI) is based on the ONF-standard TAPI model and is accessible via RESTCONF. Within the TAPI model, CONC 2.0 has implemented the following:
●      Service-interface-point
◦    List all the interfaces available for client signal connection and possible termination point of service creation
●      Topology-context
◦    Include topological information of all network nodes with their owned Network-Edge-Point (NEP)
◦    Include topological link that connects nodes in the network at their NEP
●      Connectivity-context
◦    Include connection-service (circuits) present in the network
◦    Include connections that compose all connection-service
◦    Allow for creation and deletion of connection-service
●      Physical-context
◦    Provide the inventory information off all network nodes including the hierarchical rack relationship; shelf, slot, etc.,
CONC 2.0 supports two network-provisioning models:
1.     Provisioning wavelength service path (OCH) for router-based ZR+ optics
●      Used when CONC controls the OLS Network (ROADMs, Amps, DWDM filters) but DCO (Digital Coherent Optic) is in router
●      CONC determines if the DCO service can be carried, and then sets it up (if feasible) and returns values for to HCO
●      HCO does settings on router (through CNC IP controller)
Figure 6.            
CONC 2.x service provisioning with router-based ZR+ optics workflow
2.     Provisioning service path with NCS2K (Rel12) and NCS1K (or third-party DWDM system)
Used when values are already known for a service riding the optical network (e.g., when 1004 is used or an Alien transceiver spec is imported from CONC)
●      CONC determines if that wavelength service can be carried and then sets it up (if feasible)
●      User does settings on TXP

Product specifications
Cisco ONC runs on the Cisco Crosswork Infrastructure 4.4. Infrastructure information for Cisco Crosswork is provided below (for complete requirements, see the Cisco Crosswork Infrastructure 4.4 and Applications Installation Guide).
Cisco Crosswork can be deployed in either a vCenter-managed data center or onto Cisco CSP.
●      VMware data center requirements:
●      VMware vSphere 6.7or later
●      vCenter Server 6.7
●      Update 3g or later (ESXi 6.7 Update 1 installed on hosts)
●      All the physical host machines must be organized within the same VMware data center, and while it is possible to deploy all the cluster nodes on a single physical host (provided it meets the requirements), it is recommended that the nodes be distributed across multiple physical hosts to get better performance and support High Availability.
●      The networks required for the Crosswork management and data networks need to be built and configured within the data center and must allow L2 communication. A single pair of network names is required for these networks to be used across all the physical host machines hosting the Crosswork VMs.
Cisco Cloud Services Platform (CSP) data center requirements
●      Cisco CSP release 2.8.0.276
●      Allowed hardware list:
◦    UCSC-C220-M5S, UCSC-C240-M5SX

◦    CSP-5200, CSP-5216, CSP-5228
◦    CSP-5400, CSP-5436, CSP-5444, CSP-5456
●      CSP host or cluster is set up and installed with a minimum of two physical Ethernet interfaces - one Ethernet connected to the management network, and the other to the data network.
Requirements for CONC 2.0 Installation are three VM clusters. Each VM needs to be on a different compute.
Minimum config for each VM: 12 vCPUs | 96 GB RAM Memory | 966 GB SSD.
(SSD is recommended. In a case of HDDs, then more than 10,000 RPM required.)
The VMs need to be interconnected by 10G links between them (both management and data).
