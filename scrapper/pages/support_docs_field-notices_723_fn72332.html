Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCwa70008 Expired certs cause Security Intelligence updates to fail
Problem Description
For affected versions of Firepower software, the Cisco Talos security intelligence updates might fail after March 5, 2022 due to a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate change.
Background
The existing SSL certificate authority (CA) used to sign certificates for Talos security intelligence updates will be decommissioned and replaced on March 6, 2022.
This Talos website has been signed by this CA and is used to obtain Talos security intelligence updates: https://intelligence.sourcefire.com.
Problem Symptom
Affected Firepower platforms will be unable to receive the latest Talos intelligence feeds (IPs, URLs, DNS Hosts).
The platform might experience a degraded security posture for future threats. Health monitoring indications regarding failures to download Talos security intelligence updates should be ignored until the platform software is upgraded to a fixed release.
No other content updates (Snort Rule Updates (SRUs), Vulnerability Database (VDB), Geolocation Database (GeoDB), and so on) will be affected by this issue.
Workaround/Solution
Cisco recommends to upgrade to one of the Firepower software versions shown in the table in order to continue to receive the latest Talos security intelligence updates.
The Firepower Management Center (FMC) must be updated to fix the certificate issue. The Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) device managed by the FMC does NOT need to be updated to fix the certificate issue.
The Firepower Device Manager (FDM) must be updated to fix the certificate issue for the FTD device managed by the FDM.
