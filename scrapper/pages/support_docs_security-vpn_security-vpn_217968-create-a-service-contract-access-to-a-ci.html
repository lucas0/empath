Introduction
This document describes the process of the addition of a Cisco service contract access to a Cisco.com account.
Prerequisites
Before you start, you must have access to this data:
Active Cisco.com account
Contract Number
Add a Cisco Service Contract Access to a Cisco.com Account
Step 1. Navigate to Cisco Software Central and log in with your Cisco.com account.
Step 2. Click the profile button, and then choose Manage Profile.
Step 3. On the Profile Management page, click Access Management.
.
Step 4. On the Access tab, under Services & Support, click Add Access.
Note: If your service contract is already associated with your Cisco.com account, you can find your current contract on the 'Your Current Access' tab. If you have already requested your service contract to be associated with your Cisco.com account, you can find your access requests on the 'Your Access Requests' tab.
Step 5. In the Add Access dialog box, choose TAC and RMA case creation, Software Download, support tools, and entitled content on Cisco.com, and then click Go.
Step 6. Choose the Specific Contract radio button, and then clickBy Service Contract Number and enter the service contract number(s) in the field next to it. ClickSubmit.
If the information on your contract (for example, a company name) matches the information on your Cisco.com account, then the contract is automatically added to your Cisco.com account.
If the automation fails due to the information mismatch, then the entitlement needs to be further verified manually. If that is the case, you are to be contacted by Cisco for further clarification within the next two hours.
