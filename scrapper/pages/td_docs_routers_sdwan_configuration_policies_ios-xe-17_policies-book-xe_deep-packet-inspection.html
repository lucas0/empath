SD-WAN Application Intelligence Engine Flow Overview
The SD-WAN Application Intelligence Engine (SAIE) flow provides the ability to look into the packet past the basic header information. The SAIE flow determines the contents of a particular packet, and then either records that information for statistical purposes or performs an action on the packet.

Note
In Cisco vManage Release 20.7.x and earlier releases, the SAIE flow is called the deep packet inspection (DPI) flow.
Benefits include increased visibility into the network traffic, which enables network operators to understand usage patterns and to correlate network performance information along with providing usage base billing or even acceptable usage monitoring. The SAIE flow can also reduce the overall costs on the network.
You can configure the SAIE flow using a centralized data policy. You define the applications of interest in a Cisco vManage policy list or with the policy lists app-list CLI command, and you call these lists in a policy data-policy command. You can control the path of the application traffic through the network by defining, in the action portion of the data policy, the local TLOC or the remote TLOC, or for strict control, you can define both.
The following list of protocols are not supported in SAIE flow:
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)
Configure SD-WAN Application Intelligence Engine Flow Using Cisco vManage
To configure the SD-WAN Application Intelligence Engine (SAIE) flow, use the Cisco vManage policy configuration wizard. The wizard consists of the following sequential screens that guide you through the process of creating and editing policy components:
Create Applications or Groups of Interest—Create lists that group together related items and that you call in the match or action components of a policy. For configuration details, see Configure Groups of Interest.
Configure Traffic Rules—Create the match and action conditions of a policy. For configuration details, see Configure Traffic Rules.
Apply Policies to Sites and VPNs—Associate policy with sites and VPNs in the overlay network.

Apply Centralized Policy for SD-WAN Application Intelligence Engine Flow
To ensure that a centralized data policy for the SD-WAN Application Intelligence Engine (SAIE) flow takes effect, you must apply it to a list of sites in the overlay network.
To apply a centralized policy in Cisco vManage, see Configure Centralized Policy Using Cisco vManage.
To apply a centralized policy in the CLI:
vSmart(config)# apply-policy site-list list-name data-policy policy-name (all | from-service | from-tunnel)
By default, data policy applies to all data traffic passing through the Cisco vSmart Controller: the policy evaluates all data traffic going from the local site (that is, from the service side of the router) into the tunnel interface, and it evaluates all traffic entering to the local site through the tunnel interface. You can explicitly configure this behavior by including the all option. To have the data policy apply only to policy exiting from the local site, include the from-service option. To have the policy apply only to incoming traffic, include the from-tunnel option.
You cannot apply the same type of policy to site lists that contain overlapping site IDs. That is, all data policies cannot have overlapping site lists among themselves. If you accidentally misconfigure overlapping site lists, the attempt to commit the configuration on the Cisco vSmart Controller fails.
Monitor Running Applications
To enable the SD-WAN Application Intelligence Engine (SAIE) infrastructure on Cisco vEdge devices, you must enable application visibility on the devices:

Note
In Cisco vManage Release 20.7.x and earlier releases, the SAIE flow is called the deep packet inspection (DPI) flow.
vEdge(config)# policy app-visibility
To display information about the running applications, use the show app dpi supported-applications, show app dpi applications, and show app dpi flows commands on the device.
View SAIE Applications
You can view the list of all the application-aware applications supported by the Cisco SD-WAN software on the router using the following steps:
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Monitor > Devices.
Cisco vManage Release 20.6.x and earlier: From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Monitor > Network.
Click WAN-Edge, select the Device that supports the SD-WAN Application Intelligence Engine (SAIE) flow. The Cisco vManage Control Connections page is displayed.
In the left pane, select Real Time to view the device details.
From the Device Options drop-down, choose SAIE Applications to view the list of applications running on the device.
From the Device Options drop-down, choose SAIE Supported Applications to view the list of applications that are supported on the device.
Action Parameters for Configuring SD-WAN Application Intelligence Engine Flow
When data traffic matches the conditions in the match portion of a centralized data policy, the packet can be accepted or dropped, and it can be counted. Then, you can associate parameters with accepted packets.
From the Cisco vManage menu, you can configure match parameters from:
Configuration > Policies > Centralized Policy > Add Policy > Configure Traffic Rules > (Application-Aware Routing | Traffic Data | Cflowd) > Sequence Type > Sequence Rule > Action
Configuration > Policies > Custom Options > Centralized Policy > Traffic Policy > (Application-Aware Routing | Traffic Data | Cflowd) > Sequence Type > Sequence Rule > Action.
In the CLI, you configure the action parameters under the policy data-policy vpn-list sequence action command.
Each sequence in a centralized data policy can contain one action condition.
In the action, you first specify whether to accept or drop a matching data packet, and whether to count it:
Table 1.
Description Cisco vManage
CLI Command
Value or Range
Accept the packet. An accepted packet is eligible to be modified by the additional parameters configured in the action portion of the policy configuration.
Click Accept.
accept
—
Count the accepted or dropped packets.
Action Counter
Click Accept, then action Counter
count counter-name
Name of a counter. Use the show policy access-lists counters command on the Cisco device.
Discard the packet. This is the default action.
Click Drop
drop
—
To view the packet logs, use the show app log flow and show log commands.
Then, for a packet that is accepted, the following parameters can be configured.
Table 2.
Description Cisco vManage CLI Command Value or Range
DSCP value.
Click Accept, then action DSCP.
set dscp value
0 through 63
Forwarding class.
Click Accept, then action Forwarding Class.
set forwarding-class value
Name of forwarding class
Direct matching packets to a TLOC that matches the color and encapsulation
By default, if the TLOC is not available, traffic is forwarded using an alternate TLOC.
Click Accept, then action Local TLOC.
set local-tloc color color [encap encapsulation]
color can be:
3g, biz-internet, blue, bronze, custom1, custom2, custom3, default, gold, green lte, metro-ethernet mpls, private1 through private6, public-internet, red, and silver.
By default, encapsulation is ipsec. It can also be gre.
Direct matching packets to one of the TLOCs in the list if the TLOC matches the color and encapsulation
By default, if the TLOC is not available, traffic is forwarded using an alternate TLOC. To drop traffic if a TLOC is unavailable, include the restrict option.
Click Accept, then action Local TLOC
set local-tloc-list color color encap encapsulation [restrict]
Set the next hop to which the packet should be forwarded.
Click Accept, then action Next Hop.
set next-hop ip-address
IP address
Apply a policer.
Click Accept, then action Policer.
set policer policer-name
Name of policer configured with a policy policer command.
Direct matching packets to the name service, before delivering the traffic to its ultimate destination.
The TLOC address or list of TLOCs identifies the remote TLOCs to which the traffic should be redirected to reach the service. In the case of multiple TLOCs, the traffic is load-balanced among them.
The VPN identifier is where the service is located.
Configure the services themselves on the Cisco devices that are collocated with the service devices, using the vpn service configuration command.
Click Accept, then action Service.
set service service-name [tloc ip-address | tloc-list list-name] [vpn vpn-id]
Standard services: FW, IDS, IDP
Custom services: netsvc1, netsvc2,netsvc3, netsvc4
TLOC list is configured with a policy lists tloc-list list.
Direct matching packets to the named service that is reachable using a GRE tunnel whose source is in the transport VPN (VPN 0). If the GRE tunnel used to reach the service is down, packet routing falls back to using standard routing. To drop packets when a GRE tunnel to the service is unreachable, include the restrict option. In the service VPN, you must also advertise the service using the service command. You configure the GRE interface or interfaces in the transport VPN (VPN 0).
Click Accept, then action Service.
set service service-name [tloc ip-address | tloc-list list-name] [vpn vpn-id]
Standard services: FW, IDS, IDP
Custom services: netsvc1, netsvc2,netsvc3, netsvc4
Direct traffic to a remote TLOC. The TLOC is defined by its IP address, color, and encapsulation.
Click Accept, then action TLOC.
set local-tloc color color [encap encapsulation]
TLOC address, color, and encapsulation
Direct traffic to one of the remote TLOCs in the TLOC list.
Click Accept, then action TLOC.
set tloc-list list-name
Name of a policy lists tloc-list list
Set the VPN that the packet is part of.
Click Accept, then action VPN.
set vpn vpn-id
0 through 65530
Default Action
If a data packet being evaluated does not match any of the match conditions in a data policy, a default action is applied to the packet. By default, the data packet is dropped.
From the Cisco vManage menu, you modify the default action from Configuration > Policies > Centralized Policy > Add Policy > Configure Traffic Rules > Application-Aware Routing > Sequence Type > Sequence Rule > Default Action.
In the CLI, you modify the default action with the policy data-policy vpn-list default-action accept command.
Configure SD-WAN Application Intelligence Engine Flow Using the CLI
Following are the high-level steps for configuring a centralized data policy for the SD-WAN Application Intelligence Engine (SAIE) flow.

Note
In Cisco vManage Release 20.7.x and earlier releases, the SAIE flow is called the deep packet inspection (DPI) flow.
Create a list of overlay network sites to which the data policy is to be applied using the apply-policy command:
vSmart(config)# policy
vSmart(config-policy)# lists site-list list-name
vSmart(config-lists-list-name)# site-id site-id
The list can contain as many site IDs as necessary. Include one site-id command for each site ID. For contiguous site IDs, you can specify a range of numbers separated with a dash (–).
Create additional site lists, as needed.
Create lists of applications and application families that are to be subject to the data policy. Each list can contain one or more application names, or one or more application families. A single list cannot contain both applications and application families.
vSmart(config)# policy lists
vSmart(config-lists)# app-list list-name
vSmart(config-app-list)# app application-name

vSmart(config)# policy lists
vSmart(config-lists)# app-list list-name
vSmart(config-applist)# app-family family-name
Create lists of IP prefixes and VPNs, as needed:
vSmart(config)# policy lists
vSmart(config-lists)# data-prefix-list list-name
vSmart(config-lists-list-name)# ip-prefix prefix/length

vSmart(config)# policy lists
vSmart(config-lists)# vpn-list list-name
vSmart(config-lists-list-name)# vpn vpn-id
Create lists of TLOCs, as needed:
vSmart(config)# policy
vSmart(config-policy)# lists tloc-list list-name
vSmart(config-lists-list-name)# tloc ip-address color color encap encapsulation [preference number]
Define policing parameters, as needed:
vSmart(config-policy)# policer policer-name
vSmart(config-policer)# rate bandwidth
vSmart(config-policer)# burst bytes
vSmart(config-policer)# exceed action
Create a data policy instance and associate it with a list of VPNs:
vSmart(config)# policy data-policy policy-name
vSmart(config-data-policy-policy-name)# vpn-list list-name
Create a series of match–pair sequences:
vSmart(config-vpn-list)# sequence number
vSmart(config-sequence-number)#
The match–action pairs are evaluated in order, by sequence number, starting with the lowest numbered pair and ending when the route matches the conditions in one of the pairs. Or if no match occurs, the default action is taken (either rejecting the route or accepting it as is).
Define match parameters based on applications:
vSmart(config-sequence-number)# match app-list list-name
Define additional match parameters for data packets:
vSmart(config-sequence-number)# match parameters
Define actions to take when a match occurs:
vSmart(config-sequence-number)# action (accept | drop) [count]
For packets that are accepted, define the actions to take. To control the tunnel over which the packets travels, define the remote or local TLOC, or for strict control over the tunnel path, set both:
vSmart(config-action)# set tloc ip-address color color encap encapsulation
vSmart(config-action)# set tloc-list list-name
vSmart(config-action)# set local-tloc color color encap encapsulation
vSmart(config-action)# set local-tloc-list color color encap encapsulation [restrict]
Define additional actions to take.
Create additional numbered sequences of match–action pairs within the data policy, as needed.
If a route does not match any of the conditions in one of the sequences, it is rejected by default. If you want nonmatching prefixes to be accepted, configure the default action for the policy:
vSmart(config-policy-name)# default-action accept
Apply the policy to one or more sites in the overlay network:
vSmart(config)# apply-policy site-list list-name data-policy policy-name (all | from-service | from-tunnel)
Use the following show commands for visibility in to traffic classification:
show app dpi flows
show support dpi flows active detail
show app dpi application
show support dpi flows expired detail
show support dpi statistics
