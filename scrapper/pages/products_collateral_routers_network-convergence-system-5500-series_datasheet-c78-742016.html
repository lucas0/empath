    The new generation of Cisco NCS 5700 series 400GE line cards increases forwarding capacity of NCS 5500 by 2.7 times to a maximum of 153.6 Tbps per system.
Product overview
Based on the Cisco® Global Cloud Index, digitalization is projected to grow global data center and public/private cloud network traffic more than 25 percent annually. To help network providers meet these challenges, the Cisco Network Convergence System 5500 Series is built with features such as extremely high port densities, deep packet buffering, and forwarding hardware optimized for these types of deployments.
The Cisco NCS 5500 Series modular chassis provides a wide variety of line cards to address customer needs to use flexible interfaces and port densities, along with full bandwidth utilization of the forwarding ASIC. The latest generation of line cards, which are shipping today, provides the capability for dense 400G interface ports with QSFP-DD optics, thus providing operators with readiness for mass-scale networking.
The new generation of NCS 5700 series line cards consists of 400GE and 100GE optimized line cards in both the base version and the scale (SE) version as well as a modular line card in base version. The scale version supports enhanced configuration needs with expanded Forwarding Information Base (FIB), Quality of Service (QoS), Access Control Lists (ACL), and so on. These line cards are capable of advanced packet forwarding, segment routing, programmable network management, and telemetry, along with the robust and mature features already present in 64-bit Cisco IOS® XR Software. Note that the newer generation line cards require the second-generation fabric cards and fan trays for NCS 5500 modular chassis to be installed on the system.
The NCS 5700 line cards are backward compatible and they can co-exist with previous generation line cards on a chassis with the second-generation fabric cards and fan trays, supporting the same features and scale as the previous generation line cards. This mode of operation will be referred to as compatibility mode. On a system with only NCS 5700 line cards, referred to as native mode, the system will support richer feature set and higher feature scale and is supported in IOS XR software release 7.2.1 or later.
The two 400GE optimized line cards in the NCS5700 series are NC57-24DD and NC57-18DD-SE and both of them are powered by 2 forwarding ASICS. The Cisco NC57-24DD line card (Figure 1), which is the base variant, provides 24 ports of 400 GE, providing an aggregate bandwidth of 9.6 Tbps. This line card uses QSFP28 / QSFP+ / QSFP-DD transceivers and is to be used in any of the NCS 5500 series of modular chassis.
Figure 1.            
Cisco NCS 5700 Series 24-port 400 GE Base Line Card
The Cisco NC57-18DD-SE line card (Figure 2) is an enhanced scale (SE) version which improves the FIB scale capabilities up to 5M IPv4 or 3M IPv6 prefixes compared to the base line card. NC57-18DD-SE provides 18 ports of 400 GE or 30 ports of 200 GE/100 GE, and provides up to 7.2 Tbps bandwidth per line card. The 18 400GE ports are the even numbered ports between port 1 and port 29 and the ports 0, 19, 21 and 23. They are highlighted in blue on the face plate of the scale line card.
Figure 2.            
Cisco NCS 5700 Series 18-port 400 GE Scale Line Card
If all the 18 ports in NC57-18DD-SE are used in 400 GE mode, the remaining 12 ports will be disabled. Alternately, the line card can be used as all 30 ports in 200 GE or 100 GE mode or 40GE mode or as a mix of 40GE or 100 GE or 200 GE or 400 GE, up to a total of 7.2 Tbps. Note that ports 0 to 17 and ports 24 to 29 on NC57-18DD-SE line card can only be used in pairs (one top port and its respective bottom port make a pair). Within a pair, if the top port has 200 GE or 100GE or 40GE optics, the respective bottom port in the pair should also be the same 200GE or 100GE or 40GE optics.
As the QSFP-DD optics have the same cage size as the QSFP optics, the same ports on the 400 GE line cards can act as 40 GE, 100 GE, 200 GE, or 400 GE, therefore allowing operators to migrate to 400 GE at their own pace as the need arises. The 400 GE ports will also support 100 GE via breakout of 4x100 GE.
In addition to the 400GE optimized line cards, there are two 100GE optimized line cards introduced as part of NCS 5700 series line cards, NC57-36H-SE (scale variant) and NC57-36H6D-S (base variant). Both the new line cards, like the 400GE optimized line cards, operate in compatibility mode (co-exist with the previous generation line cards in a modular chassis) as well as native mode (all NCS 5700 line cards in a modular chassis).
The Cisco NCS 5700 Series 100G optimized base line card, NC57-36H6D-S (Figure 3) is a combo line card with 4.8 Tbps throughput. NC57-36H6D-S provides a mix of 40GE, 100GE, 200GE and 400GE ports with macsec support and Class C timing support on all ports. Ports 24 – 35 in the line card are flex ports and they can be 400GE or 200GE/100GE ports. 6 of the ports in the port range 24-35 can be operated as 400GE (indicated in blue color on the face plate) and all 12 of them can be operated as either 200GE or 100GE ports. Each even port and the adjacent odd port in the port range 24-35, operate in pairs. NC57-36H6D-S line card thus provides flexible port configuration and can be used as 36x100GE or 24x100GE + 12x200GE(2x100GE) or 24x100GE + 6x400GE ports. NC57-36H6D-S line supports qsfp-dd, qsfp28 and qsfp+ optics. QSFP-DD coherent optics, like QDD-100G-ZR and QDD-400G-ZR/ZRp are only supported in the even numbered, or upper row ports.
The ports on NC57-36H6D-S line card are also segregated to quad groups with 4 ports in a sequence form a quad group (ports 0-3, ports 4-7, ports 8-11 and so on form a quad group). The restriction on a combination of 40GE and 4x10GE optics or a combination of 4x10GE and 4x25GE is limited to quads in port 0 -23 range alone. Quad groups with ports 24-27, 28-31 and 32-35 do not have any restriction on combination of optics.
Figure 3.            
Cisco NCS 5700 Series 36 port 100GE or (24 port 100GE and 6 port 400GE) Base Line Card
NC57-36H-SE Scale line card (Figure 4) provides 36 100GE ports and a total throughput of 3.6Tbps. NC57-36H-SE line card supports higher FIB scale (up to 5M IPv4 or 3M IPv6 prefixes) and higher feature scale compared to the base variant. NC57-36H-SE supports qsfp28, qsfp+ optics and breakout support for 4x25GE and 4x10GE is available only on the ports in the top row (even numbered ports) of the faceplate.
The ports on NC57-36H-SE are segregated into quad groups and 4 ports in a sequence form a quad group (ports 0-3, ports 4-7, ports 8-11 and so on form a quad group). Within a quad group, a combination of 40GE and 4x10GE optics or a combination of 4x10GE and 4x25GE is not supported. There is no other restriction on any combination of optics within a quad group.

Cisco NCS 5700 Series 36 port 100 GE Scale Line Card
The Cisco NCS 5700 modular line card NC57-MOD-S (figure 5) is a Base line card with 2.8T throughput. It combines in one line card 2x800G MPA slots, 8xSFP56 ports and 2xQSFP-DD ports. The 2x800G MPA slots accept all legacy 400G and new 800G MPA in the NCS 5500/5700 product portfolio while on NC55-MPA-12T-S only 10G optics are supported. The SFP56 ports support optics ranging from 10G to 50G and the QSFP-DD ports support QSFP based optics up to 400G including QDD-400G-ZR/ZRp.
