CSCwd28106 Deprecate weak cryptographic encryption algorithms used in an OSPFv3 IPsec configuration
Problem Description
In software releases earlier than Cisco IOS® XE Release 17.11.1, weak cryptographic algorithms DES, 3DES, and MD5 can be configured for Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) using the IPsec protocol.
In Cisco IOS XE Release 17.11.1 and later, weak cryptographic algorithms are no longer allowed by default due to their weak cryptographic properties. Cisco strongly recommends the use of stronger cryptographic algorithms in their place. In order to continue to use such weak cryptographic encryption algorithms, explicit configuration is required. Otherwise, OSPF neighborship will fail to establish and cause service disruption as a result.
This table lists the OSPF IPsec configurations and algorithms affected by this change.

Background
In Cisco IOS XE Release 17.11.1 and later, such weak cryptographic encryption algorithms will not be allowed by default and require explicit configuration to be allowed.
Device(config-router)#area 1 encryption ipsec spi 0x100 esp ?

  aes-cbc  Use AES-CBC encryption

  null     ESP with no encryption

Device(config-router-af)#area 1 virtual-link 1.1.1.1 encryption ipsec spi 0x100 esp ?

  aes-cbc  Use AES-CBC encryption

  null     ESP with no encryption
Problem Symptom
If the OSPFv3 IPsec configuration is not updated to use strong cryptographic algorithms prior to the Cisco IOS XE Release 17.11.1 software upgrade, OSPF neighborship will fail to establish and cause service disruption as a result.
Workaround/Solution
Recommended Solution
Before you upgrade the software to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.11.1 or later, update the OSPFv3 IPsec configuration to use strong cryptographic algorithms, specifically AES-CBC for encryption and SHA1 for authentication.
Workaround
This is a workaround only and not the recommended solution.
Enter this configuration command for OSPFv3 IPsec in order to continue to function with the weak algorithms upon an upgrade to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.11.1.
Device(config)#crypto engine compliance shield disable
Note: This command is only available in Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.1 and later, and will only take effect after a reboot. Cisco does NOT recommend this option as these weak cryptographic algorithms are insecure and do not provide adequate protection from modern threats. This command should only be used as a last resort.
