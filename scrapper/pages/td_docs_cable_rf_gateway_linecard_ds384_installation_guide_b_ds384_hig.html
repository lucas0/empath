Cisco RF Gateway 10 DS-384 Line Card Hardware Installation Guide
Overview
The Cisco RF Gateway 10 Universal Edge Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (UEQAM) Downstream 384 line card (hereafter called the Cisco RFGW-10 DS-384 line card) is a high-density downstream quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) card that resides in the RF Gateway-10 chassis. It supports a maximum of 384 downstream channels through flexible QAM-capacity licensing. The Cisco RFGW-10 DS-384 line card supports both DOCSIS data, video on demand (VoD), and switched digital video (SDV).
Effective with Cisco IOS-XE Release 3.3.1SQ and Cisco IOS-XE Release 3.2.3SQ, the Cisco RFGW-10 supports the new version of the Cisco RFGW-10 DS-384 line card with P4080 CPU revision 3. The Version Identifier (VID) of the new Cisco RFGW-10 DS-384 line card is 2. Ensure that you run one of the following releases on the Supervisor engine 7-E for using the new version of Cisco RFGW-10 DS-384 line card (with P4080 CPU revision 3):
Cisco IOS-XE Release 3.3.1SQ or later releases
Cisco IOS-XE Release 3.2.3SQ or later releases

Note
If the Supervisor engine 7-E is running a release earlier than the above releases, the new version of the Cisco RFGW-10 DS-384 line card (with P4080 CPU revision 3) does not downgrade and hence, does not work.
Effective with Cisco IOS-XE Release 3.2.0SQ, the Cisco RFGW-10 DS-384 line card supports the following features:
Different port density combinations of up to 8 ports and 384 QAMs on every line card.
Support for 1 QAM per port, 2 QAM per port, 4 QAM per port, 8 QAM per port, and up to 128 QAMs per port in increments of 4. For example:
8 ports of 48 QAMs per port
6 ports of 64 QAMs per port
3 ports of 128 QAMs per port
Downstream RF performance compliant with CableLabs CM-SP-DRFI-I11-110210.
Flexible licensing of 64 to 384 QAMs carriers per line card in increments of 1 QAM.

Note
Effective with Cisco IOS-XE Release 3.4.0SQ, for Annex B, the Cisco RFGW-10 supports a maximum of 1024 downstream channels per line card, where a maximum of 384 QAMs as pilots and a maximum of 640 QAMs as replicate. For Annex A, the Cisco RFGW-10 supports a maximum of 768 downstream channels per line card, where a maximum of 288 as pilot and 480 as replicate.
As with all components in the RF Gateway 10, the Cisco RFGW-10 DS-384 line card also provides high availability. Up to two protect line cards can be configured to operate in redundancy mode.
A line card failure results in a failover to the protect line card in less than a second. The failed line card can be debugged by taking it offline, resetting it, and bringing it back online and into operation.
The Cisco RFGW-10 DS-384 line card is designed to support a wide range of line card health conditions and initiate failover events if considered catastrophic:
QAM/upconverter HW failure. The line card monitors both the digital and RF data integrity. The modules also provide a comprehensive alarm structure to the system CPU, which allows constant monitoring of the upconverter (UPX).
Environmental alarms (temperature, voltage, frequency).
Software kernel failures.
Software module failure.
DOCSIS Timing Interface (DTI) clock/timing failures (both internal and external).

Note
If a Cisco RFGW-10 DS-384 line card is present in slot 9, then the Timing, Communication, and Control (TCC) card in slot 13 causes crosstalk resulting in packet loss on that line card. It is recommended that you replace the TCC cards.
Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP) failures.
The Cisco RFGW-10 DS-384 line card, when used as a downstream RF line card, supports both video and downstream external PHY interface (DEPI).
The Cisco RFGW-10 DS-384 line card has two upconverter modules and four RF outputs per upconverter. The upconverter module provides 128 channels per port and a high level of carrier per QAM frequency agility. Every upconverter module can process and output 384 ITU-B/C QAM channels and 288 ITU-A QAM channels.
When using the Cisco RFGW-10 DS-384 line card, a Supervisor card with greater throughput capabilities is required. Starting with Cisco IOS-XE Release 3.2.0SQ, the RF Gateway 10 supports the Cisco RF Gateway 10 Supervisor Engine 7-E.
The Cisco RF Gateway 10 Supervisor Engine 7-E is supported by the Cisco IOS-XE Release 3.2.0SQA release train.
The Cisco RF Gateway 10 Supervisor Engine 7-E has the following features:
848 Gbps switching capacity with 250 Mbps of throughput
Four non-blocking 10 Gigabit Ethernet uplinks (SFP+)
SFP support on uplinks for flexibility of up to 4 Gigabit Ethernet
External USB and Secure Data (SD) memory card support for flexible storage options
For more information on the Cisco RF Gateway 10 Supervisor Engine 7-E, see the Cisco RF Gateway 10 Hardware Installation Guide.
Figure 1. Front Panel View of Cisco RFGW-10 DS-384 Line Card

Front Panel Interfaces
The Cisco RFGW-10 DS-384 line card provides the following external interfaces:
Two SFPs and two SFP+ on the front panel—The SFP+ connector can support both GigE SFP and 10 GigE SFP modules. Because the Cisco RFGW-10 DS-384 line card does not support link redundancy and the maximum backplane data bandwidth is 20 Gbps, the line card supports the following front panel SFP configurations:
4x GigE SFP
3x GigE SFP 1x10 GigE SFP+
2x GigE SFP 2x10 GigE SFP+
2x10 GigE SFP+
Front panel SFP status LEDs
Front panel ASI monitor port—This port is normally used for video program monitoring.
Front panel line card status LEDs—For more information see, the LED Status section.
Eight backplane RF ports—The Cisco RFGW-10 DS-384 line card has eight RF output ports to the RF Gateway 10 chassis backplane. The RF ports connect to the RF switch line cards in the chassis. Each RF port covers the RF spectrum from 45 MHz to up to 1 GHz range.

Note
The Cisco RFGW-10 DS-384 has eight RF ports, therefore the last four ports on the RF switch are unused.
24 Gbps backplane data plane—The Cisco RFGW-10 DS-384 line card has two backplane bidirectional 12 Gbps data links from the Cisco RF Gateway 10 Supervisor Engine 7-E.
Backplane DTI clock and control signals—The DTI 10.24 MHz clock and the time stamp synchronize the Edge QAM and the modular CMTS (M-CMTS) core to the same time base.
Backplane active supervisor control—The backplane active Supervisor control interface indicates the primary and standby role of the two Supervisor cards in the chassis.

Tools and Equipment
To remove and replace the line card, you need the following tools and equipment:
New/replacement line card.
#2 phillips or a flathead screwdriver.
Electrostatic discharge (ESD)-preventive wrist strap.
Antistatic surface, such as a mat or antistatic bag.
Safety Information and Warnings
Electrical Equipment Guidelines
Before beginning any procedures requiring access to the chassis interior, locate the emergency power-off switch for the room in which you are working.
Disconnect all power and external cables before moving a chassis.
Do not work alone in potentially hazardous conditions.
Never assume that power has been disconnected from a circuit; always check.
Do not perform any action that creates a potential hazard to people or makes the equipment unsafe.
Carefully examine your work area for possible hazards such as moist floors, ungrounded power extension cables, and missing safety grounds.
Preventing Electrostatic Discharge Damage
Electrostatic discharge (ESD) damage occurs when electronic cards or components are improperly handled, and can result in complete or intermittent failures. All line cards consist of a printed circuit card that is fixed in a metal carrier. Electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and connectors are integral components of the carrier. Although the metal carrier helps to protect the cards from ESD, use an antistatic strap each time you handle the modules. Handle the carriers by the edges only; never touch the cards or connector pins.

Caution
Always tighten the captive installation screws on all system components when you are installing them. These screws prevent accidental removal of the module, provide proper grounding for the system, and help to ensure that the line card connectors are properly seated in the backplane. Captive screws should be torqued to 6-8 in-lbs to ensure proper grounding and mechanical support. Never use cordless or corded drills to tighten screws; power screwdrivers and hand tools are acceptable.
Static electricity can harm delicate components inside your system. To prevent static damage, discharge static electricity from your body before you touch any of your system components. As you continue to work on your system, periodically touch an unpainted metal surface on the computer chassis.
The following guidelines can prevent ESD damage:
Always use an ESD-preventive wrist or ankle strap and ensure that it makes good skin contact. Before removing a card from the chassis, connect the equipment end of the strap to the ESD plug at the bottom of the chassis below the power entry modules. Ensure that the chassis or rack or both have a grounding cable installed.
Handle line cards by the faceplate and carrier edges only; avoid touching the card components or any connector pins.
When removing a card, place the removed module component-side-up on an antistatic surface or in a static-shielding bag. If the module will be returned to the factory, immediately place it in a static-shielding bag.
Avoid contact between the modules and clothing. The wrist-strap protects the card from ESD voltages on the body only; ESD voltages on clothing can still cause damage.
When transporting a sensitive component, first place it an antistatic container or packaging.
Handle all sensitive components in a static-safe area. If possible, use antistatic floor pads and workbench pads.

Caution
For safety, periodically check the resistance value of the antistatic strap. The measurement should be between 1 and 10 megohms.
