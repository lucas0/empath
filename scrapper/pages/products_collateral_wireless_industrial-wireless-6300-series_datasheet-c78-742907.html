    Cisco® Catalyst® IW6300 access points deliver secure, scalable, and flexible wireless connectivity to the most hazardous industrial environments, reliably delivering actionable data to always-on businesses.
Product overview
Designed for the most hazardous industrial locations, Cisco Catalyst IW6300 Heavy Duty Access Points deliver wireless connectivity, IoT control, and robust data collection to dangerous environments. Mines, refineries, and factory floors are undergoing a digital transformation, with Wi-Fi availability extracting live insights from equipment and workers alike. With 802.11ac Wave 2 connectivity, dual Power over Ethernet Plus (PoE+) out for IoT sensors or peripherals, multiple power-in sources, and a variety of uplink options, the IW6300 is a flexible wireless solution today’s dynamic industry landscape requires. The IW6300 carries an IP67 rating and Class I, Division/Zone 2 certification, as well as a temperature rating of -40 to +75 degrees Celsius, making it an ideal mesh network component for heavy industry use. Additional customization beyond antenna and mounting options include WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, GPS, Bluetooth Low-Energy, and Zigbee modules, as well as customer or partner-built modules for specific use cases.
Features and benefits
Table 1.           IW6300 access points features and benefits
Feature
Benefit
Class I, Division/Zone certification and IP67 rating
Deploy wireless connectivity anywhere, and stay online during the most extreme weather, in consistently hazardous areas, or during dangerous industrial events.
Dual PoE out
Send power to, and backhaul data directly from, local IoT assets such as IP cameras, sensors, or tracking systems.
Cisco IOx-ready and built for Cisco DNA
Cisco and Linux combine to create a powerful application environment with secure connectivity, all designed to be managed on a single pane of glass with Cisco DNA Center.
802.11 AC Wave 2
Provides up to 867-Mbps data rate with 2 x 2 MIMO and 2 spatial streams.
Modular expansion
Add capabilities, including GPS or Zigbee, or unique partner- or customer-built modules directly to the chassis.
Wireless Bridging
Extend the network to remote, difficult-to-access sites using Wireless Bridging.
Flexible deployment with HAZLOC certification
Every hazardous environment is unique. Whether a remote mine or local refinery, each location provides a different set of constraints, but presents the same additional value made available by digitization and connectivity. Monitor leaks, track assets and personnel, and control remote enabled devices from a central, safe location.
The Cisco Catalyst IW6300 Series Heavy Duty Access Points bring wireless connectivity to these dangerous worksites. The HAZLOC Class I, Division/Zone 2 certified, IP67-rated access point provides the rugged enclosure needed in heavy industry, with a variety of configurations to match any deployment scenario. These access points offer:
●     Multiple power sources, including AC, DC, DCW, PoE+, and Cisco Universal Power over Ethernet (UPOE).
●     Flexible backhaul. Deliver actionable IoT data to your network via Small Form Factor Pluggable (SFP), Ethernet, and wireless uplink.
●     Modular expansion. Add IoT capability and future-proof your solutions with a variety of modules, including GPS, WirelessHART, Zigbee, and client-built modules.
●     Antenna selection, with four ports for external, single or dual band, directional, or omnidirectional antenna, with up to 27 dBm output power per radio in two-antenna mode.
●     Reach anywhere. Wireless Bridging mode and mesh capability enable coverage of less accessible areas.
