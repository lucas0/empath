Cisco ISE
Why Cisco ISE?
    What if IT and security operations could respond to change and reduce risk with seamless access to network resources from anywhere, to everywhere, and on anything? And, what if controlling and managing access to the workplace was radically simplified and modernized to build security resilience into the network?
Resilience begins with securing the network connection
For the digitally connected organization, having security resilience is paramount to maintain business continuity amidst unpredictable threats and change. The world has gone hybrid, and most, if not all of, business success depends on secure, connected experiences. And with today’s IT operating across multiple environments, ensuring only trusted users and devices gain access to trusted network resources is more important than ever to protect the integrity of the business amidst the expanding attack surface and unprecedented levels of global uncertainty
Cisco® Identity Services Engine (ISE) gives customers the flexibility and choice they require to tether Network Access Control workloads to multiple clouds and maintain business continuity through uncertainty. Customers gain a modernized way to deploy NAC services. Moving from managing infrastructure in a box to leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC) across hybrid deployments, teams can accelerate the delivery of pervasive visibility and dynamic control to secure access across the distributed network and preserve the integrity of the business.
Benefits
●      Security resilience. Rapidly deploy Network Access Control workloads across multiple clouds and achieve security resilience for the self-managed infrastructure
●      Pervasive visibility and dynamic control. See, know, and control what is connecting to your network and ensure their posture doesn’t jeopardize your business.
●      Fully mature zero trust. Integrate intelligence from across your stack into policy enforcement points throughout the network for continuous trusted access.
●      Automated threat containment. Don’t just block threats—remove them with integrated intelligence into enforcement points within the network.
●      Merge speed and agility. Move Ops from managing infrastructure in a box to Infrastructure in Code (IaC) with automated deployments to accelerate secure network access.
In today’s connected world
Uncertainty has become the new normal
Because change comes faster than ever, businesses are making massive investments across the enterprise to strengthen resilience. From financial resilience to operations resilience, from organizational to supply chain resilience, these initiatives are designed to help businesses operate in the new normal. And these investments will fall short without security resilience because security cuts through every aspect of these initiatives. Security resilience is the ability to protect the integrity of every aspect of your business to withstand unpredictable threats, or changes, and then emerge stronger.
Resilience begins with securing the network connection
If organizations are to be resilient, they require flexibility and choice in deploying secure Network Access Control services to protect the integrity of the business amidst unpredictable threats and change. To emerge stronger from security incidents, pervasive visibility and dynamic control into users and endpoints connecting to network resources is a top concern for IT as they secure network access across multiple environments.
Reducing risk, and emerging stronger
As uncertainty breeds risk, resilient organizations are reducing risk by closing the gaps between siloed solutions and looking to activate intelligence across the entire security stack. Integrated intelligence with a platform approach enables continuous trusted access that goes beyond building trust just at authentication and provides security throughout the entire session for mature zero-trust architectures.
IT is Hybrid—Don’t forget your infrastructure in your network security
The hybrid reality of IT is driving resiliency. Organizations are demanding solutions that provide the flexibility and choice they need to tailor deploying network resources in line with reducing risk. In addition, the self-managed infrastructure remains a critical environment for IT as they look to secure their most prized IT assets from unknown threat vectors and enable the connect-from-anywhere and connect-on-anything workforce.
How Cisco ISE enforces Zero Trust
Connecting trusted users and endpoints with trusted resources
Endpoint request access
●      Endpoint is identified and trust is established
●      Posture of endpoint verified to meet compliance
Trust continually verified
●      Continually monitors and verifies endpoint trust level
●      Vulnerability to identify indicators of compromise
●      Automatically updates access policy
Cisco ISE
Endpoint classified, and profiled into groups:
●      Endpoints are tagged w/SGTs
●      Policy applied to profiled groups based on least privilege
Endpoint authorized access based on least privilege:
●      Access granted
●      Network segmentation achieved
  “We now have better visibility, more granular segmentation, better policy enforcement, and better identity and access management.”

How it works
Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) activates intelligence from across the security stack to become the policy decision point in a zero-trust architecture for the workplace. Cisco ISE enables an automated approach to discover, profile, authenticate, and authorize trusted endpoints and users connecting to the self-managed network infrastructure, regardless of access medium. Cisco ISE has maintained market dominance for over ten years with its unique ability to receive and share context from the network as well as integrate intelligence. With integrated intelligence, Cisco ISE builds zero-trust policy decision points into the network for continuous trusted access and automated threat containment.
Network administrators can develop and maintain dynamic risk-based polices to ensure that only trusted users and devices gain access to trusted resources, moving protection beyond authentication and maintaining trust throughout the entirety of the session.
With Cisco ISE, organizations are confidently moving from a point solution approach that only solves for a single, immediate “compliance task” and aligning to strategic business objectives with a zero-trust policy enforcement platform that will handle what’s now, and what’s next, in the self-managed infrastructure.
Use Cases
Cisco ISE addresses these challenges with a broad set of mission-critical Network Access Control (NAC) use cases to support zero trust across the distributed network.
●      Pervasive visibility. See and know everything connecting. The first step to building a resilient security posture is gaining the ability to see and know everything that is connecting to the network. Cisco ISE automates the discovery of devices connecting to the network. With Cisco ISE, teams can identify, classify, and track endpoints connected to the network to allow the automation of policy provisioning before allowing access to network resources. IT teams have the flexibility they need to balance business objectives with security and can choose between an agent or agentless approach to gain the visibility required to look deep into the device and ensure endpoint compliance. Any changes to the overall posture of any endpoint automatically and dynamically updates the policy to control access, ensure compliance, reduce risk, and contain threats.
●      Dynamic control. Confidently build security into your network with visibility-driven network segmentation. Network segmentation builds zero trust into the network with policy-based access to contain and prevent the lateral movement of threats. Organizations can shrink the attack surface, limit the spread of ransomware, and enable rapid threat containment, all while continually assuring this level of protection will not disrupt business outcomes.
●      Automated threat containment. Don’t just block threats—remove them. Cisco ISE integrates with Cisco Security products and third-party ecosystem partners through pxGrid and pxGrid Cloud to gain contextual information from on-prem and cloud-native solutions. This open integration ecosystem brings an active arm of policy enforcement into your security stack to automate threat containment, remove threats, and reduce mean time to repair.
●      Endpoint compliance. Business continuity relies on a strong, resilient security posture. ISE continually verifies that device posture complies with your security policy so that risky, unpatched, and outdated devices cannot threaten the network. Cisco ISE 3.x increases organizational posture with a customizable approach to gaining continuous posture assessments for endpoints connecting to your managed infrastructure. With a limitless number of posture checks, customers can now customize and enforce dynamic policy and gain continuous trusted access to ensure business resiliency, while limiting organizational risk without disrupting business objectives.
●      Secure access. Accelerates value by simplifying the provisioning of policies and devices. Cisco ISE enables self-registration, automates device configuration and manages certificates and mobile policy compliance. With granular visibility and controls IT admins can confidently and quickly provision new resources to allow connection to the network without sacrificing protection.
