Striving for educator effectiveness and equity
New Teacher Center’s comprehensive professional learning program:
Uses internet-based communications technology to improve the efficiency and reach of their core products, services, and operations.
Partners with school systems to build an instructional culture anchored in on-the-job professional learning that is rooted in equity, rigorous standards, and curriculum.
Disrupts the predictability of educational inequities for systemically underserved students by accelerating educator effectiveness.

“New Teacher Center provides high-quality professional learning, leadership development, and coaching for educators who serve students with the highest needs. With this support, educators are more effective at all levels -- they stay in the profession longer while their students learn more.”
Desmond K. Blackburn, PhD, CEO, New Teacher Center
Building student-teacher trust by reducing bias
Cisco has supported the development of New Teacher Center’s high-tech solutions:
Cisco’s latest support helped to launch the Classroom Connection Program—a psychologically robust program that protects teacher-student relationships from the harmful effects of stigma and bias.
The program helps teachers build the strong, empathic relationships that provide students with the trust, respect, and psychological safety essential to whole child development.
With Cisco’s support in 2019-2020, the Classroom Connections Program pilot directly served 72 teachers and 1,588 students.
The Program evolved based on lessons learned during the piloting process, and it continues to grow and scale.
Cisco’s support has benefited the 25,000 teachers that New Teacher Center serves annually, helping to impact 1.8 million students.
Five months of extra learning
