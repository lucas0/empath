Cisco Nexus Dashboard Data Broker with Cisco Nexus switches
Cisco Nexus Dashboard Data Broker (NDDB) (formerly Nexus Data Broker (NDB)) with Cisco Nexus Family switches is a software-defined, programmable solution for packet brokering. Packet brokering is the aggregation of network traffic mirrored or copied using network/optical TAPs or Cisco Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN) for monitoring and visibility. In contrast to monitoring solutions based on traditional packet brokers, the Cisco NDDB packet brokering approach offers a simple, scalable, and cost-effective solution well suited for customers who need to monitor higher volume and business-critical traffic for security, compliance, and application-performance measurement. It also enables real-time traffic visibility with an event-based approach through northbound APIs.
Cisco Nexus Dashboard Data Broker can be run in the following modes:
●      Centralized mode on a separate compute node (virtual machine or bare metal)
●      Embedded mode on Cisco Nexus 3000 or 9000 series switches
●      As an application on Cisco Nexus Dashboard (starting from Release 2.1)
●      As an application on Cisco APIC
Cisco Nexus Dashboard Data Broker supported devices
Cisco Nexus Dashboard Data Broker support is available on both fixed and modular Cisco Nexus switches. Table 1 lists the support information. Use the device grouping information to determine the appropriate license part number to use.

OpenFlow and NX-API support on Cisco Nexus Dashboard Data Broker
Cisco Nexus Dashboard Data Broker supports both OpenFlow and NX-API.
OpenFlow is supported on Nexus 3000 and Nexus 3500 switches. For details on the PIDs and support, please refer to the “Cisco NDB Hardware and Software Interoperability Matrix” in the Cisco Nexus Dashboard Data Broker release guide: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/net_mgmt/xnc/nexus_data_broker/release_notes/nexus-data-broker-release-notes-39.html
NX-API is supported on all Cisco Nexus 9300 (EX/FX/FX2/FX3/GX) and 9500 switches (but only EX and FX line cards).
Cisco Nexus 3550 switch as TAP device
Cisco Nexus Dashboard Data Broker supports the Nexus 3550 switch (Cisco Nexus 3550-F Fusion L1) as a TAP device. The 3550-F can be onboarded and programmed as a TAP device from the Nexus Dashboard Data Broker controller. This L1 switch can replace up to 16 optical TAPs in a small 1RU form factor.
Cisco Nexus 3550-Fusion switch has four bays, each of which houses a line card with 16 SFP ports. Depending on the number of TAPs required, these modules should be ordered in addition to the switch. PID details are given in Table 6, below.

Cisco Nexus Dashboard Data Broker licensing
A Cisco Nexus Dashboard Data Broker add-on license is required for each NDDB switch that will be used for packet brokering. An NDDB add-on license is available primarily in subscription model (a subscription license is available only for Nexus 9000 series switches at this time). The part numbers differ depending on the switch form factor and also the term length in the case of the subscription model. But the same part number can be used for all deployment methods of the NDDB controller.
Tables 2 and 3 provide ordering information for the Cisco Nexus Dashboard Data Broker software license when buying along with the Nexus switches (under “Edit Options” in Cisco Commerce).

Table 5 provides ordering information for the Nexus NX-OS software license, which is needed for the NDB/aggregation switches. Also, the table gives the license requirements Cisco IOS-XE for Cisco Catalyst® 9000 Switches, which will be supported as production switches starting from Cisco Nexus Dashboard Data Broker Release 3.10.1.

Software license type
Description
NX-OS
Cisco NX-OS Essentials
For all Nexus switches that will be used as NDDB/Tap-Agg switches (only if sFlow or NetFlow generation is done by the NDDB switch)
IOS-XE
Cisco DNA Essentials
License type needed on the Catalyst-9K switch if SPAN needs to be configured
The Catalyst switch will be the production switch and NOT an NDDB/Tap-Agg switch
IOS-XE
Cisco DNA Advantage or Cisco DNA Premier
License type needed on the Catalyst-9K switch if ERSPAN needs to be configured
The Catalyst switch will be the production switch and NOT an NDDB/Tap-Agg switch
Note 1: The NX-OS software image part number must be added because the NDDB switch runs an NX-OS image.
Note 2: If the NDB license does not appear as an add-on license, an a-la-carte license for the right form factor can be ordered as a workaround.
Note 3: The IOS-XE software image part number must be added when one or more of the production switches are Catalyst switches.
Note 4: To evaluate NDDB in the lab, a separate license is not required; you can perform an evaluation of NDDB without any license. A license needs to be purchased before deploying the NDB in production.
