    The Cisco Cloud Services Platform (CSP) 5000 Series is a turnkey, open Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) platform based on x86 and RHEL Kernal-based Virtual Machine (KVM). It is optimized for the networking data plane and for operational simplicity, and can be managed with orchestration or as standalone network platform.
Product Overview
Cisco Cloud Services Platform (CSP) 5000 Series platforms are x86 Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) software and hardware platforms for the data center, regional hub, and colocation Network Functions Virtualization (NFV). The platforms enable enterprise IT teams or service providers to quickly deploy any Cisco or third-party network virtual service with Cisco’s Network Services Orchestrator (NSO) or any other northbound management and orchestration system. Or they can be used standalone through a simple, built-in native web user interface, a Command-Line Interface (CLI), a Representational State Transfer (REST) API, and NETCONF/YANG interfaces. The Cisco CSP 5000 Series comes in either 1-rack-unit (Figure 1) or 2RU form factors to fit the requirements of Virtual Network Functions (VNF) and network-service chains in network and compute.

Cisco CSP 5200 (1 RU) and CSP 5400 (2RU)
The CSP 5000 Series can be deployed within data centers, regional hubs, colocation centers, the WAN edge, the DMZ, and even at a service provider’s Point of Presence (PoP), hosting various Cisco and third-party VNFs (see Figure 2).

Features and Benefits
Table 1 outlines key features and benefits of the CSP 5000 Series.
Table 1.        Features and Benefits
Feature
Benefit
Single Root I/O Virtualization
(SR-IOV), Open vSwitch Data Plane Development Kit (OVS-DPDK)
The optimized data plane provides near-line rates for SR-IOV-enabled VNFs and provides high throughput with OVS DPDK interfaces.
Uniform web, CLI, and REST API
The CSP 5000 supports NETCONF/YANG, which enables consistent behavior across different interfaces.
CLI interface
Cisco IOX CLI interface reduces training and learning time.
Prominent Feature/Differentiator/Capability
Most applications have been virtualized over the past decade, and now the same trend is occurring in network services. With this trend, often referred to as network functions virtualization or NFV, network services can be deployed and managed much more flexibly, because they can be implemented in a virtualized environment using x86 computing resources instead of purpose-built dedicated hardware appliances. The CSP 5000 Series can assist you in making this technology transition.
In data centers and colocation facilities today, network services primarily run on purpose-built hardware appliances. This approach is inflexible in that you are locked into a single function on each physical network appliance for the life of the appliance, resulting in under-utilized resources. You often have to wait weeks or even months for new hardware.
Some of today’s challenges for data center teams deploying virtual network services include:
●      Keeping pace with the server team. Can the network, security, and load balancer teams deploy a virtual network service within minutes?
●      Commercial hypervisor product and support costs
●      OpenStack complexity, which is still too complex for many organizations
●      OpenStack overhead, which requires five to eight hosts just to get started
●      Little or no access to a VMware vCenter Server or Microsoft System Center VMM and computing resources
●      Lack of a tool set to manage virtual services
●      Lack of Linux OS expertise
●      Low comfort level with dedicated hardware appliances
The CSP 5000 Series addresses these requirements with a solution that provides the agility of software with the performance of hardware to reduce both time and expense. From the edge of your network to your server farm or point of presence, you can virtualize services with the CSP 5000 to optimize your resource use, hosting several virtual services per node and extending your equipment lifecycle through reuse. And faster deployment of new virtual services can help you better support your users and applications.
Some benefits of the CSP 5000 include:
●      Operational simplicity
●      Turnkey appliance that can be up and running in five minutes
●      Open NFV platform for both Cisco and third-party VNFs
●      Network-friendly CLI syntax and intuitive GUI
●      Increased automation and operational agility
Platform Support/Compatibility
The CSP 5000 series supports a wide variety of Cisco and third-party Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) from third-party vendors, including firewalls, load balancers, and other value-added services. Some supported VNFs include:
●      Cisco Cloud Services Router (CSR) 1000V virtual router
●      Cisco IOS® XRv 9000 Router
●      Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)
●      Cisco Firepower™ NGFW Virtual
●      Cisco Prime® Virtual Network Analysis Module (vNAM)
●      Cisco Virtual Wide Area Application Services (vWAAS)
●      Cisco Web Security Virtual Appliance (WSAv)
●      Cisco Virtual Security Gateway (VSG) for Cisco Nexus® 1000V Series Switch deployments
●      Cisco Virtual Supervisor Module (VSM) for Cisco Nexus 1000V Series Switch deployments
●      Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM)
Several third-party VNFs can be run on the CSP 5000, but for the best experience customers should deploy VNFs that are certified as a part of the Cisco third-party VNF ecosystem. For information on the Cisco third-party VNF ecosystem and which VNFs are certified and supported on the CSP 5000 visit:
