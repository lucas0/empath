Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCux71901 [DOC] Rack Server Documentation on Default CIMC Password Cisco1234
Problem Description
A number of C-Series servers have shipped to customers with a non-standard default password which prevents access to the Cisco Integrated Management Controller (CIMC) unless the configured password is provided.
Background
Systems manufactured between November 17, 2015 and January 6, 2016 were produced with a different default password.
Problem Symptom
Customers might not be able to log in to their C-Series servers with the published default admin password "password" since this has been changed to "Cisco1234" for these systems. Customers should access the CIMC interface with this combination "admin":"Cisco1234" and set the password back to the default or a customer desired password.
Workaround/Solution
Workaround #1(Recommended)
Log in to the system with this alternate password "Cisco1234" and change it to a known password.
Workaround #2
Connect crash cart to the system. Power the system on and use the F8 menu in order to reset the CIMC to factory defaults or change the admin password:
Workaround #3
Note: This workaround assumes that the CIMC is online and the IP address is known.
This solution is for customers who used DHCP to IP the CIMC(s). Use XML API in order to log in to one or more system and change the password. A sample script is provided:
Download IMC PowerTool module from IMC PowerTool.
Save and run this file as a .ps1 file:
Import-Module CiscoImcPs 
$multiimc = Set-ImcPowerToolConfiguration -SupportMultipleDefaultImc $true
# The tool prompts the user to enter IP addresses when run.
$imclist = Read-Host "Enter Cisco IMC IP or list of IMC IPs separated by commas"
[array]$imclist = ($imclist.split(",")).trim()
$user = 'admin'
# The non-standard password is on the next line (update as needed).
$pass = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "Cisco1234" -AsPlainText -Force
$cred = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList $user, $pass
$out = Connect-Imc -Credential $cred $imclist
# The password on the next line is the new password for this user.
$newpass = "password"
Get-ImcLocalUser -Id 1 | Set-ImcLocalUser -Pwd $newpass -Force | Out-GridView
$out = Disconnect-Imc
