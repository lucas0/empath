About Fabric Manager Web Client
Using Fabric Manager Web Client, you can monitor Cisco MDS 9000 Series or Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch events, performance, and inventory, and perform minor administrative tasks.
Fabric Manager Web Client provides the following features:
•Summary and drill down reports—The Performance Manager summary report provides a high-level view of your network performance. These reports list the average and peak throughput and provides hot-links to additional performance graphs and tables with additional statistics. Both tabular and graphical reports are available for all interconnections monitored by Performance Manager. Performance Manager also analyzes daily, weekly, monthly and yearly trends. You can also view the results for specific time intervals using the interactive zooming functionality. These reports are only available if you create a collection using Performance Manager and start the collector. To view historical performance reports, you need to install Adobe Flash Player 10 or later.
See the "Historical Performance Monitoring" section.
•Zero maintenance database for statistics storage—No maintenance is required to maintain Performance Manager's round-robin database, because its size does not grow over time. At prescribed intervals the oldest samples are averaged (rolled-up) and saved. A full two days of raw samples are saved for maximum resolution. Gradually the resolution is reduced as groups of the oldest samples are rolled up together.
You see Fabric Manager Web Client window as shown in Figure 7-1.

•Select SAN to view information for all fabrics and VSANs in the SAN. When you do this, a Fabric column is added as the first column of the tables.
•Click a fabric folder to view information for that specific fabric.
•Some screens have expandable fabric folders. You can expand the fabric folders (by clicking the + or - icons in front of the folders) to see a list of VSANs in that fabric. Select a VSAN to view information for that VSAN.
The features accessible from the tabs are limited to the areas you select in the filter tree.
Table Filtering and Navigation
You can filter the display of some tables to view subsets of the information. At the top right of these tables are one or more drop-down lists. Select an item from these lists, and then click Filter to filter the table information on that item.
You can change the number of rows displayed per page by selecting a number from the Rows per page drop-down list at the lower left corner of the table. Once you select a number, the table is updated with the new number of rows; you do not have to click a button.
For tables with multiple pages of information, you can:
•Jump to the first or last page of the table by clicking the first page or last page icons (arrows with a bar in front of it)
•Jump to the next page or previous page by clicking the next page or previous page icons (arrows)
•Jump to a specific page by entering the page number in the Go to page field and clicking the Go button.
You can search certain columns in the tables for information if a table column has a black icon next to the column head. Click the icon to display a Search dialog box.
Printing
There is a Print icon in the lower right corner of some tables. Click this icon to view the table in a printer-friendly format. You can then print the page from the browser.
Exporting to a File
There is an Export icon in the lower right corner of some tables. Click this icon to export the data to a .CSV file that can be read by programs such as Microsoft Excel.
Sorting Columns
On some screens, you can click a column head to sort the information for that column.
Installing Fabric Manager Web Client
If you are installing the Fabric Manager Web Client software for the first time, or if you want to update or reinstall the software, you access the supervisor module of the switch using a web browser. Install Fabric Manager Web Client on the same workstation where you installed Fabric Manager Server.
You must install Fabric Manager Web Client to view Performance Manager reports through a web browser.
For switches running Cisco MDS 9000 FabricWare, you need to install the Fabric Manager Web Client software from the CD-ROM included with your switch, or download Fabric Manager from Cisco.com.
To install Fabric Manager Web Client from the CD-ROM, navigate to the Fabric Manager installation notes and follow the directions.
To download the software from Cisco.com (requires a valid user name and password), open a web browser and go to the following website:
http://www.cisco.com/
The Cisco web page opens.
From the Support menu, choose Download Software.
To download and install the software on your workstation, follow these steps:
Step 1 Optionally, enter the IP address or host name of the supervisor module running Cisco MDS NX-OS in the Location or Address field of your browser. You see the installation page displayed by the HTTP server of the supervisor module.
When you connect to the server for the first time, it checks to see if you have the correct Sun Java Virtual Machine version installed on your workstation. If you do not have the correct version installed, a link is provided to the appropriate web page on the Sun Microsystems website so you can install it.
a. Click the Sun Java Virtual Machine software link (if required) to install the software.
b. Using the instructions provided by the Sun Microsystems website, reconnect to the supervisor module by reentering the IP address or host name in the Location or Address field of your browser.
Note We recommend Java version 1.5(x) or later. To use IPv6 addresses, you must have Java version 1.5. To change the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version, start Java Web Start and set the Java preferences.
Step 2 Click the Fabric Manager Web Client installation link. You see a prompt asking for permission to install the application on your workstation.
Step 3 Click Yes to run the installer, which detects the installed version of the software, and prompts for upgrades or downgrades and other options if applicable.
Note If TCP port 80 is in use, Fabric Manager Web Client checks port 8080 next. If that port is also in use, Fabric Manager Web Client uses the next available port. You can set the TCP port that you want Fabric Manager Web Client to use during the installation process.
Unless you specify a different directory on a Windows PC, the software is installed in the default location of C:\Program Files\Cisco Systems\MDS 9000. A Cisco MDS 9000 program group is created under
Start > Programs. This program group contains shortcuts to Fabric Manager and Device manager.
On a UNIX (Solaris or Linux) machine, the installation path is /usr/local/cisco_mds9000. If this directory is not writable by the user, which is the case for non-root users, the default is set to $HOME/cisco_mds9000. Shell scripts are created in the bin directory.
Note On a Windows PC, you install Fabric Manager Web Client as a service. This service can then be administered using the Services Panel from the Windows Control Panel. By default, Fabric Manager Web Client automatically starts when the workstation is rebooted. You can change this behavior by modifying the properties in the Services Panel.
Note You need to configure the Fabric Manager Server on the DNS server for remote logins unless the Fabric Manager Server is binding to a specific interface.
Using Fabric Manager Web Client with SSL
Fabric Manager Web Client uses TCP port 80 by default. If you want to install SSL certificates and use Fabric Manager Web Client over HTTPS (using TCP port 443 or another custom port), you need a certificate for each external IP address that accepts secure connections. You can purchase these certificates from a well-known Certificate Authority (CA).
To enable SSL, users must set up the keystore to use either a self-signed certificate or a certificate from a trusted third-party company such as Verisign.
To create a local certificate, follow these steps:
Step 1 Set up a keystore to use self-signed certificate (local certificate). From the command line, enter the following command:
%JAVA_HOME%/bin/keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA -keystore "C:\Program 
Files\Cisco Systems\MDS 9000\keystore"
Step 2 Enter your name, organization, state, and country. Enter changeit when prompted for a keystore password. If you prefer to use your own password, do not forget to change the keystorepass attribute in the server.xml file. When prompted for a key password, press Enter or use the same password as the keystore password.
Note You can now follow the steps in the next section for modifying Fabric Manager Web Client to use SSL.
In order to obtain a certificate from the Certificate Authority of your choice, you must create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). The CSR is used by the certificate authority to create a certificate that identifies your website as secure.
To create a CSR, follow these steps:
Step 1 Create a local certificate (as described in the previous section).
Note You must enter the domain of your website in the field first and last name in order to create a working certificate.
Step 2 The CSR is then created with this command:
keytool -certreq -keyalg RSA -alias tomcat -file certreq.csr -keystore "C:\Program 
Files\Cisco Systems\MDS 9000\keystore"
Now you have a file called certreq.csr. The file is encoded in PEM format. You can submit it to the certificate authority. You can find instructions for submitting the file on the Certificate Authority website. You will receive a certificate.
Step 3 Once you have your certificate, you can import it into your local keystore. You must first import a Chain Certificate or Root Certificate into your keystore. You can then import your certificate.
Step 4 Download a Chain Certificate from the Certificate Authority where you obtained the certificate:
•For Verisign.com commercial certificates, go to:
http://www.verisign.com/support/install/intermediate.html
•For Verisign.com trial certificates, go to:
http://www.verisign.com/support/verisign-intermediate-ca/Trial_Secure_Server_Root/index.html
•For Trustcenter.de, go to:
http://www.trustcenter.de/certservices/cacerts/en/en.htm#server
•For Thawte.com, go to:
http://www.thawte.com/certs/trustmap.html
•Import the Chain Certificate into your keystore by entering the following command:
keytool -import -alias root -keystore "C:\Program Files\Cisco Systems\MDS 9000\keystore" -trustcacerts -file filename_of_the_chain_certificate
•Import the new certificate in X509 format:
keytool -import -alias tomcat -keystore "C:\Program Files\Cisco Systems\MDS 9000\keystore" -trustcacerts -file your_certificate_filename
To modify Fabric Manager Web Client to use SSL, follow these steps:
Step 1 Stop Fabric Manager Web Client if you have already launched it. If you installed this on Windows, you can stop the service using Windows Services under Administrative Tools.
Step 2 Use a text editor to open \jboss\server\default\deploy\jboss-web.deployer\server.xml from the directory where Fabric Manager Web Client is installed. You see the following lines in the beginning after some copyright information:
    <Connector className="org.apache.catalina.connector.http.HttpConnector"
               port="80" minProcessors="5" maxProcessors="75"
               enableLookups="false" redirectPort="8443"
               acceptCount="10" debug="0" connectionTimeout="60000"/>
    <!-- Define an SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8443 -->
    <!--
    <Connector className="org.apache.catalina.connector.http.HttpConnector"
               port="8443" minProcessors="5" maxProcessors="75"
               enableLookups="true"
               acceptCount="10" debug="0" scheme="https" secure="true">
      <Factory className="org.apache.catalina.net.SSLServerSocketFactory"
               clientAuth="false" protocol="TLS"/>
    </Connector>
    -->
Step 3 Comment the first <Connector> element and uncomment the second one. Note that the port changes from 8443 to 443 and keystore and keypass are added. Your file should look like the following example:
    <!--
    <Connector className="org.apache.catalina.connector.http.HttpConnector"
               port="80" minProcessors="5" maxProcessors="75"
               enableLookups="false" redirectPort="8443"
               acceptCount="10" debug="0" connectionTimeout="60000"/>
    -->
    <!-- Define an SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8443 -->
    <Connector className="org.apache.catalina.connector.http.HttpConnector"
               port="443" minProcessors="5" maxProcessors="75"
               enableLookups="true"
               acceptCount="10" debug="0" scheme="https" secure="true">
      <Factory className="org.apache.catalina.net.SSLServerSocketFactory"
               clientAuth="false" protocol="TLS"
               keystoreFile="C:\Program Files\Cisco Systems\MDS 9000\keystore"
               keystorePass="changeit"/>
    </Connector>
Step 4 Save this file.
Step 5 Restart Fabric Manager Web Client.
Note If you restart Fabric Manager Server with SSL enabled, you must restart Fabric Manager Web Client. If you want to stop and restart Fabric Manager Server with SSL disabled, then you must restart Fabric Manager Web Client.

Viewing Predicted Future Performance
To plan storage network changes, it is necessary to determine when configuration changes (such as rezoning) may be needed to meet growing performance demands. Fabric Manager Server provides a performance prediction report to enable you to more easily predict when storage network connections will become overutilized.
In general, to create a performance prediction report, do the following:
•Specify the period of time in the past that you want to use as a sample to predict the future performance.
•Specify the threshold values that you do not want to exceed.
•Specify the period of time in the future for which you want to view performance.
Fabric Manager Server extrapolates the performance and lists in chronological order which interfaces are expected to reach the threshold within the specified time period.
Using the Default Values
When you first view predicted future performance by clicking the Performance tab and then the Prediction tab, you see a table showing the predicted performance for your entire SAN using the default values. The default values are as follows:
•Scope—Entire SAN
•Past performance period—Month
•Future performance period—Month
•Threshold—80%

Step 3 If you are using absolute values, follow these steps, otherwise skip to Step 3.
a. To configure conditions for sending Critical notifications, check the Send Critical check box. In the "...when traffic exceeds" field, enter a number (from 5 to 95) to indicate the percentage at which the Critical notification is sent. For example, entering 10 causes a notification to be sent when traffic at any given time exceeds 10% of capacity.
b. To configure conditions for sending Warning notifications, check the Send Warning check box. In the "...when traffic exceeds" field, enter a number (from 5 to 95) to indicate the percentage at which the Warning notification is sent. For example, entering 9 causes a notification to be sent when traffic at any given time exceeds 9% of capacity.
Step 4 Select the time period for the collection (1 Week, 1 Month, or 1 Year) from the Baseline Values over past drop-down list. The baseline value represents the sum of the absolute values.
a. To configure conditions for sending Critical notifications, check the Send Critical check box. In the "...when traffic exceeds" field, enter a number to indicate the percentage at which the Critical notification is sent. For example, entering 300 causes a notification to be sent when traffic for the selected period exceeds 300% of capacity.
b. To configure conditions for sending Warning notifications, check the Send Warning check box. In the "...when traffic exceeds" field, enter a number to indicate the percentage at which the Warning notification is sent. For example, entering 150 causes a notification to be sent when traffic for the selected period exceeds 150% of capacity.
Step 5 Click Apply.
Importing the RRD Statistics Index
To manually import the RRD statistics index, follow these steps:
Step 1 Stop Fabric Manager Server.
Step 2 Copy the original RRD file into $INSTALLDIR/pm/db.
Step 3 Run $INSTALLDIR/bin/pm.bat s.
Step 4 Restart the Fabric Manager Server and add the fabric.
Configuring the RRD Database
Configuring the RRD database allows you to set the intervals at which data samples are collected. After applying the configuration, the database storage format is converted to a new format at those intervals. Since database formats are incompatible with each other, you must copy the old data (before the conversion) to the $INSTALLDIR/pm directory. See"Importing the RRD Statistics Index" section.
To configure the RRD database using Fabric Manager Web Client, follow these steps:
Step 1 Click the Admin tab, and then click Configure.
Step 2 Select Database in the left navigation pane.
You see the Performance Database (collection interval) page as shown in Figure 7-60.
Figure 7-60 Performance Database Page
Step 3 Enter the number of days to collect samples at 5-minute intervals in the top row of the Days column.
Step 4 Enter the number of days to collect samples at 30-minute intervals in the second row of the Days column.
Step 5 Enter the number of days to collect samples at 2-hour intervals in the third row of the Days column.
Step 6 Enter the number of days to collect samples at 1-day intervals in the bottom row of the Days column.
Note As of Cisco SAN-OS Release 3.1(1) and later, you can configure the sampling interval for ISLs. Select a sampling interval from the ISLs drop-down list.
Step 7 Click Apply to apply your changes, or click Defaults to reset the file sizes to the default values.
If you are applying new values, or if the current values are not the default values, you see a message indicating that conversion of the RRD files will take a certain amount of time and that the database will be unavailable until then. The time it takes depends on the difference between the old and new values.
Note The system allows you to convert data, one process at a time. When you start converting the data, the Apply and Default buttons change to Refresh and Cancel so that another process cannot be inadvertently started. The display is the same for all browsers accessing the server during this time. Click Refresh to view the latest progress. Click Cancel to cancel the process of converting the data. If the job is successfully canceled, you see the Apply and Default buttons again. If the cancel job is not successful, you see a message indicating that the cancellation has failed.

If you want to perform this procedure, it is best to perform it before collecting a lot of data. Otherwise, converting the data can take a long time.
Viewing Log Information
You may occasionally want to view logs such as the Fabric Manager Server log. These processes have no corresponding GUI to allow you to view information about these log files. If you see errors, preserve these two files for viewing.
To view log information using Fabric Manager Web Client, follow these steps:
Step 1 Click the Admin tab, and then click Logs.
You see a list of viewable logs in the left column.
Step 2 Click a log file to view it.

Step 3 Click Yes to create shortcuts for Fabric Manager.
Note This message only appears the first time you launch Fabric Manager Client.
Fabric Manager Web Search Engine
The search engine helps you locate records that mach a specific criteria. The search entity is divided into two categories: inventory and performance. In the inventory type, you can search by the switch (name of the switch, IP address of the switch and WWN), Endport (alias, IP address of the switch and WWN) and VSANs (name of the VSAN, IP address of the principle switch and WWN). In the performance type, you can search by end device (Endport alias, Endport WWN), Flow (name of the flow) and ISLs (name of the ISL and WWN of the ISL). You can also use wild card characters in the search.
