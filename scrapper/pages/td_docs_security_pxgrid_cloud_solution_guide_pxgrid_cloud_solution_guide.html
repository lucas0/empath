Cisco pxGrid Cloud Overview
Cisco pxGrid Cloud is a new Cisco cloud offer that enables you to share contextual information between Cisco Identity Services Engine (Cisco ISE) and cloud-based solutions without compromising the security of your network. It provides a unified framework that enables seamless data integration between Cisco ISE and cloud-based solutions. It is secure and customizable, enabling you to share only the data that you want to share and consume only the contextual data that is relevant for your application.
Cisco ISE 3.1 patch 3 and later releases support Cisco pxGrid Cloud. Cisco and its partners and customers can develop pxGrid Cloud-based applications and register them with the pxGrid Cloud offer. These applications can use the External RESTful Services (ERS), pxGrid, and Open APIs to exchange information with Cisco ISE.
Cisco pxGrid Cloud offers the following benefits:
Plug-and-play deployment without requiring infrastructure changes to your network.
Cisco ISE as a single source of truth for endpoint identity by delivering consistent context exchange with on-premise and cloud partners.
Enrichment of Software as a Service-based (SaaS-based) security analysis with real-time endpoint context from Cisco ISE.
Threat containment by isolating endpoints from the network through actions initiated from the security SaaS solutions.
Cisco pxGrid Cloud Terminology
The following are some of the common terms that are used in the Cisco pxGrid Cloud solution and their meaning in the Cisco pxGrid Cloud environment:
Offer: A set of capabilities packaged together and offered as a solution.
Subscription: An instance of an offer being consumed by a tenant is a subscription.
App: You can create and register applications for your product based on your requirements. For example, you can create an app that can retrieve the session and endpoint data from Cisco ISE.
Applications with a cloud offering can be onboarded to Cisco pxGrid Cloud. After an application is onboarded, you can share data between your Cisco ISE deployment and the application.

Cisco pxGrid Cloud and Cisco ISE Integration
To allow connectivity between a Cisco ISE deployment and Cisco pxGrid Cloud, the pxGrid Cloud option must be enabled on one or two pxGrid nodes in the Cisco ISE deployment. If you have configured high availability for pxGrid nodes, one of the nodes acts as the Active node and the other one will be the Standby node. The Standby node takes over when the Active node goes down.
Only the Active node establishes connection to Cisco pxGrid Cloud and handles the traffic between the Cisco ISE deployment and Cisco pxGrid Cloud. No other Cisco ISE node interacts with Cisco pxGrid Cloud.
The pxGrid Cloud agent resides in Cisco ISE and serves as the bridge between Cisco ISE and Cisco pxGrid Cloud. A pxGrid Cloud application can subscribe to a pxGrid topic. The pxGrid Cloud agent in Cisco ISE learns about this subscription from Cisco pxGrid Cloud and establishes the actual subscription to the pxGrid service in Cisco ISE. When the agent receives a notification on the pxGrid topic, it forwards the notification to Cisco pxGrid Cloud over a logical channel dedicated to the pxGrid service. The pxGrid Cloud application can invoke ERS, pxGrid, and Open APIs in the Cisco ISE deployment. The pxGrid Cloud agent proxies a REST request from Cisco pxGrid Cloud to Cisco ISE, and returns the response back to Cisco pxGrid Cloud.
Cisco ISE customers who have a pxGrid Cloud subscription can register their Cisco ISE deployment with Cisco pxGrid Cloud and use the applications listed in the offer. To do this, they must:
Acquire and activate the pxGrid Cloud subscription.
Enable the pxGrid Cloud service on one or two pxGrid nodes in the Cisco ISE deployment.
Register the Cisco ISE deployment with Cisco pxGrid Cloud (associating it with the subscription) and receive an authentication token.
Enter the authentication token in the Setup Connection window in Cisco ISE (under Administration > pxGrid Services > Client Management > pxGrid Cloud Connection).
This activates the pxGrid Cloud agent on the Active pxGrid node and establish a connection between the Cisco ISE deployment and Cisco pxGrid Cloud.
Select a pxGrid Cloud application from the offer and associate it with the subscription. The application will then have access to the Cisco ISE deployment.
Connect Cisco ISE to Cisco pxGrid Cloud
After the pxGrid Cloud service is enabled, you must connect the Cisco ISE deployment to Cisco pxGrid Cloud. You must register your Cisco ISE deployment in Cisco pxGrid Cloud and generate an authentication token.
Procedure
Step 1
In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > pxGrid Services > Client Management > pxGrid Cloud Connection.
Step 2
Click Setup Connection.
Step 3
Enter the OTP in the Setup Connection window, and then click Connect.
For information on how to obtain the OTP, see Register Cisco ISE.
The connection setup includes the following steps:
Enrollment: A request is sent to Cisco pxGrid Cloud to enroll the Cisco ISE deployment using the authentication token. When this step is successfully completed, the pxGrid Cloud agent is started on the Active node in the Cisco ISE deployment.
pxGrid Connection: The pxGrid Cloud agent establishes a persistent connection to the pxGrid component running locally on the same Cisco ISE node. All pxGrid notifications from Cisco ISE are sent to the pxGrid Cloud agent using this connection.
Cloud Connection: The pxGrid Cloud agent establishes a persistent connection to Cisco pxGrid Cloud and sets up the logical channels. These logical channels are used to receive the ERS and pxGrid requests from Cisco pxGrid Cloud, and to send the pxGrid notifications to Cisco pxGrid Cloud.
You can view the connection setup progress in the pxGrid Cloud Connection window. After all these steps are completed, the status is displayed as Connected and the name of the active pxGrid node is displayed.
To terminate the pxGrid Cloud connection, click Disconnect in the pxGrid Cloud Connection window. This disconnects the Cisco ISE deployment from Cisco pxGrid Cloud and terminates the pxGrid Cloud agent on the Active node.
When the Cisco ISE deployment is connected to Cisco pxGrid Cloud, the pxGrid Cloud agent (called Hermes process) is listed in the output of the show application status ise CLI command.
Disable pxGrid Cloud Service on Cisco ISE
Procedure
Step 1
In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > System > Deployment.
Step 2
Check the check box next to the pxGrid node and click Edit.
Step 3
Uncheck the Enable pxGrid Cloud check box.
This stops the pxGrid Cloud agent in the Cisco ISE deployment. You can re-enable the pxGrid Cloud service later when needed.
Configure a pxGrid Cloud Policy
By default, pxGrid Cloud applications are not permitted to access any pxGrid services or APIs in the Cisco ISE deployment. Access must be explicitly granted by configuring policies in Cisco ISE.
You can create a policy to specify what is allowed or denied between your Cisco ISE deployment and the pxGrid Cloud service. Authorization policies specific to each partner environment can be configured in the cloud portal. You will need the Cisco ISE Advantage license to configure a pxGrid Cloud policy.

Step 1
In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > pxGrid Services > Client Management > pxGrid Cloud Policy.
Step 2
In the pxGrid Services area, choose the required services from the list. You can enable one or more pxGrid services by clicking their names.
Step 3
In the ERS APIs area, enable the ERS APIs option to provide ERS API access to pxGrid Cloud applications.
The ERS APIs option is disabled here if the ERS service is disabled in Cisco ISE.
To enable this service in Cisco ISE, perform these steps:
In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > System > Settings > API Settings > API Service Settings.
Enable the ERS (Read/Write) option.
Step 4
In the Open APIs area, enable the Open APIs option to provide Open API access to pxGrid Cloud applications.
The Open APIs option is disabled here if the Open API option is disabled in Cisco ISE.
To enable this service in Cisco ISE, perform these steps:
In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > System > Settings > API Settings > API Service Settings.
Enable the Open API (Read/Write) option.
Note

Cisco pxGrid Cloud Clients
To view the pxGrid Cloud applications, choose Administration > pxGrid Services > Client Management > Clients > pxGrid Cloud Clients.
The pxGrid Cloud offer provides a collection of registered applications that pxGrid Cloud subscribers can select and use. For example, if a subscriber registers Cisco ISE deployment in Cisco pxGrid Cloud and uses two applications, those two applications are listed in the pxGrid Cloud Clients tab. Note that you can only view the pxGrid Cloud applications in this tab. You cannot make any changes from this tab.
You can view the total number of pxGrid Cloud applications that are currently running on this deployment in the Total Clients pane in the Summary window (under Administration > pxGrid Services > Summary).
High Availability for pxGrid Nodes
The pxGrid Cloud service can be enabled on two nodes to enable high availability. When the Cisco ISE deployment is successfully connected to Cisco pxGrid Cloud, one of the nodes is selected as the Active node and the pxGrid Cloud agent is started on that node. If the Active node is down, or if the network connectivity to the Active node is lost, the Standby node is moved to the Active state. The pxGrid Cloud agent is started on that node and the connectivity to Cisco pxGrid Cloud is established again.

Note
The failover process might take around 30 seconds.
Table 1. Events that Trigger High-Availability Response
Event High-Availability Response
pxGrid Cloud service disabled on Active node Standby node immediately becomes the Active node.
Active node restarted because of a crash or user-initiated sequence
Standby node becomes Active. When the restarted node comes up, this node becomes the Standby node and monitors the Active node.
Upgrade deployment (or standalone Cisco ISE node) with one pxGrid node
After the upgrade, the node functions as the Active node.
Upgrade deployment with Active and Standby nodes
When the Standby node is upgraded, it acts as Standby node post upgrade and continues to monitor the Active node.
When the Active node is upgraded, the Standby node takes over as the Active node. When the upgraded node comes up, it becomes Standby and monitors the Active node.
Network issue occurs between the Active and Standby nodes Both the nodes operate in Active mode. When this occurs, the names of both the nodes are displayed in the pxGrid Cloud Connection window. After the connectivity between the nodes is restored, one of the nodes is selected as the Active node and the other node acts as the Standby node.
Add a new pxGrid node with pxGrid Cloud service enabled to the deployment The new node initially acts as the Active node. After the node is fully synchronized and able to communicate with its peer, one of the nodes is selected as the Active node.
The following configuration changes restart the pxGrid Cloud agent:
Replacing the pxGrid system certificate
Replacing the Admin system certificate
Enabling or disabling the Trust for authentication within ISE or Trust for authentication of Cisco Services option for any trust certificate
Changing Cisco ISE proxy settings
Enabling or disabling the ERS service for Cisco pxGrid Cloud
Enabling or disabling any pxGrid service in the pxGrid Cloud Policy window
Log Files Specific to pxGrid Cloud Service
You can check the following log files in the active pxGrid node if there is any issue related to pxGrid Cloud service:
Log File Contents Where to find
pxcloud.log
