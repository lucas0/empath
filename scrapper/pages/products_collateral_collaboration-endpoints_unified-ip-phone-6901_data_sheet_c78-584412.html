Product Overview
The Cisco Unified IP Phone 6901 is a single-line endpoint delivering cost-effective access to Cisco Unified Communications. Designed with a trimline-like low profile, the Cisco Unified IP Phone 6901 is an ideal solution for lobbies, hallways, elevators, hotel bathrooms, or other settings that have an occasional need for voice communications services.
The Cisco Unified IP Phone 6901 supports two incoming calls with call-waiting service. Fixed feature keys provide one-touch access to Hold, Redial, and Call waiting. Transfer and Conference can be supported by using the hook-switch similar to that of traditional analog phones.
The Cisco Unified IP Phone 6901 offers personalization, with the choice of two colors (charcoal and arctic white) and two handset style options (slimline and standard).
The Cisco Unified IP Phone 6901 is an earth-friendly solution. As with the other Cisco Unified IP Phone 6900 Series endpoints, the Cisco Unified IP Phone 6901 takes advantage of reground and recyclable plastics for a more earth-responsible solution.
Features and Benefits
Table 1 lists features and benefits of the Cisco Unified IP Phone 6901.

Hardware
Industrial design
●  With a trimline, low-profile design, the phone can also be wall-mounted.
●  The phone offers easy-to-use and intuitive arrangement of lines, keys, and calls.
●  Hold and Redial options on fixed hard keys provide a traditional telephony-like user experience.
Color options
●  Choice of colors: arctic white or charcoal. Handsets are available internationally as slimline or standard. You can mix and match them in the work environment to better meet your employee needs.
Desk and wall mountable
●  A foldable footstand makes viewing of and use of the buttons and keys easy in the desk-mount case.
●  The phones can be mounted onto the wall without additional Cisco Unified IP Phone 6900 wall-mount kits by working with third-party wallphone wallplates, such as Leviton 4108W-xSP wallplates.
Co-branding
●  You can include your logo on the Cisco Unified IP Phones 6900 Series endpoints. Cisco has approved third-party vendors to produce the labels.
●  One small paper label is inserted under the plastic cover at the co-branding area and shipped together with the phone from the factory. You could use this small paper label to document any information needed, because the Cisco Unified IP Phone 6901 does not support a display.
Acoustic Features
Codec support

Voice quality
●  Comfort-noise generation and voice-activity-detection (VAD) programming is supported on a system basis.
Volume control
●  A volume-control toggle makes volume adjustments easy for the handset, monitor speaker, and ringer.
