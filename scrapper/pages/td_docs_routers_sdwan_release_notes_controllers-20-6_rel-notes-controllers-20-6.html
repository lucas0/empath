Use the following command to upgrade the configuration database. This must be done on only one node in the cluster:
request nms configuration-db upgrade

Note
We recommend the data base size in the disk is less than or equal to 5GB. Use the request nms configuration-db diagnostic command to check the data base size. This is applicable only for upgrades of devices running Cisco vManage Release 20.1.1 and later.
Enter login credentials, if prompted. Login credentials are prompted if all Cisco vManage server establish control connection with each other. After a successful upgrade, all configuration-db services are UP across the cluster and the application-server is started.

Redesign of Cisco vManage GUI
From Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, Cisco vManage GUI is redesigned and offers a new visual display. Besides the new sign in screen, this section presents a comparative summary of the significant changes between older Cisco vManage releases and Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1 and later.
Change in Navigation Menu
From Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, the navigation menu at the top left of the Cisco vManage window is collapsed, and can be expanded to view the menu options. The previous releases of Cisco vManage have a static side-bar navigation menu.

Change in Position of the User Profile and Sign Out Options
From Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, the User Profile and Sign Out options are moved to the bottom of the collapsible side-bar menu in the left pane. In the previous releases, these options are available at the top-right corner of Cisco vManage.
