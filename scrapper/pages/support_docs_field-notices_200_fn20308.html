Problem Description
The Cisco ONS 15216-EDFA-2 does not alarm correctly for loss of voltage on the A or B power terminal.
Background
Cisco internal testing has revealed the following issue. When the -48VDC input is removed from either the A or B side (but not both), and the return is still connected, the EDFA-2 will not alarm. This condition should report by an alarm and blinking power LED. This problem is reproducible. It was determined that the software was not testing for an individual loss of connectors. This issue has been addressed and corrected.
Problem Symptoms
If either the A or B -48VDC connection is removed from either side while the return is still connected, the EDFA-2 does not alarm as expected.
Workaround/Solution
A software fix has been implemented and will be included in all software versions beginning with the Maintenance Release. To correct this issue, obtain and apply all aspects of the Upgrade Procedures for ONS 15216 EDFA2, 2.0.1.The installation instructions and software can be obtained at the same location.
