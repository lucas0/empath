Installing the Cisco ONS 15216-MD-40-ODD and 15216-MD-40-EVEN Mux/Demux Patch Panels
Introduction
This document explains how to install and operate the Cisco ONS 15216 100 GHz 40-channel mux/demux patch panel.
The Cisco ONS 15216 40-channel mux/demux patch panel is a new ONS 15216 FlexLayer unit that allows 40-channels of ITU wavelengths to be placed onto a single fiber, and removes 40-channels of ITU wavelengths from a single fiber.
The ONS 15216 40-channel mux/demux patch panel can be odd or even patch panels:
•15216-MD-40-ODD=: 40-channels spaced at 100 GHz on the Odd ITU grid
•15216-MD-40-EVEN=: 40-channels spaced at 100 GHz on the Even ITU grid
The only difference between the 15216-MD-40-ODD and 15216-MD-40-EVEN is the operating 100 GHz ITU grid. See "Channel Wavelength Allocation" section for C-band channel wavelength plan for the odd and even patch panels.
The patch panel can combine 40-channels of ITU wavelengths spaced at 100 GHz to a denser DWDM signal and separate the combined signal to 40-channels of ITU wavelengths spaced at 100 GHz. To increase the network capacity, the patch panel is plugged with an interleaver and deinterleaver module and is used along with another patch panel of a different grid. The interleaver module combines the signals from the 15216-MD-40-ODD and 15216-MD-40-EVEN patch panels spaced at 100 GHz to a denser DWDM signal spaced at 50 GHz and the deinterleaver module splits the combined signal (80 channel signal) to the 15216-MD-40-ODD and 15216-MD-40-EVEN patch panels in the opposite direction.
For installing the interleaver and deinterleaver module, refer to the "Installing Cisco ONS 15216-MD-ID-50 Optical Interleaver and Deinterleaver Pluggable" guide.

Product Description
The Cisco ONS 15216 40-channel mux/demux patch panel is a new ONS 15216 FlexLayer unit that allows 40-channels of ITU wavelengths to be placed onto a single fiber, and removes 40-channels of ITU wavelengths from a single fiber.
The patch panel works with 100 GHz WXC cards. When the patch panel works with 50 GHz WXC cards, the patch panel must be used with a pluggable interleaver and deinterleaver module along with another patch panel of a different grid.
The patch panel can be used in:
•Standalone or with existing FlexLayer OADMs
•Multiplex Add/Drop for single module ROADM
•Multiplex Add/Drop for 50 GHz WXC
Features
The patch panel provides signal multiplexing and demultiplexing in 100 GHz channel spacing DWDM systems. It is optically and electrically passive and requires no temperature control. It uses fused fiber coupler technologies and a birefringent crystal technology platform. The ultra-low dispersion of the patch panel coupled with the wide bandwidth reduces the concerns of dispersion accumulation and bandwidth narrowing, making the patch panel ideal for Multi-OADM Metro ring or mesh-based architectures.
Some of the operating features of the patch panel include:
•Low dispersion
•Low insertion loss
•High channel isolation
•Wide clear bandwidth
•Full C-band coverage
•Multiplex and demultiplex 40-channels
•Athermal design
Functional Description
The functional unit of the ONS 15216 odd and even patch panel is the passive A-Thermal AWG (arrayed waveguide grating) optical module. The AWG optical module comprises of the mux and demux module as shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1 Mux and Demux AWG Modules
The multiplexer (mux) module combines signals from Chi-RX ports (40-channels) into the aggregated COM-TX port. An integrated tap-coupler combines the aggregated signals with the additional external sources injected at AUX-MUX port. An integrated tap-coupler splits 1% of the aggregated signals towards MON-MUX port that is used for monitoring purpose.
The demultiplexer (DMX) module separates the aggregated signals into individual Chi-TX ports. An integrated tap-coupler splits 1% of the aggregated signals coming from COM-RX port towards MON-DMX port that is used for monitoring purpose.

Fiber-Optic Connector Cleaning and Maintenance
Connector cleaning is required to maintain the performance of fiber-optic circuits. It is important that both the LC/UPC connector at the end of the fiber-optic cable and the mating bulkhead adapter on the front panel of the patch panel are clean before the connection is made.
Warning Invisible laser radiation may be emitted from disconnected fibers or connectors. Do not stare into beams or view directly with optical instruments. Statement 1051
The following warning applies to disposal of chemicals and other materials used to clean connectors and adapters:
Warning Ultimate disposal of this product should be handled according to all national laws and regulations. Statement 1040
Note Before installing the fiber-optic cable, always perform the cleaning procedure for cable connectors described in the following section. Whenever possible, inspect each connector before connecting it to the mating bulkhead adapter on the front panel.
Note The LC bulkhead adapters on the faceplate of the patch panel drawer are less likely to get dirty if they are capped when not in use. Because the procedure for a thorough cleaning of these adapters is complicated, Cisco recommends that you use a commercially available cleaning kit and closely follow the instructions included with the kit.
Customer Supplied Cleaning Materials
The Type A fiber optic connector cleaners (for example, CLETOP reel) are recommended to clean the cable connectors, but are not supplied with the patch panel.
When cleaning a paired cable connector (bulkhead mating adapter), always clean the mating adapter first.
If properly maintained (only used with clean, defect-free fiber connectors and capped when not in use), the mating adapter would not require cleaning. However, if you suspect the adapter is dirty, clean it by using the CLETOP stick swab.
Note For multi-fiber cable assemblies, use specific cleaning tools or materials designed for the assembly type.
Clean the Bulkhead Mating Adapters
Step 1 Read the manufacturer (cleaning cartridge) instructions to insert the cartridge cleaning tip into the mating adapter.
Step 2 Slide the lever on the cartridge to swipe the mating surface.
Note Always keep unused adapter ports and fiber connectors capped with a clean dust cap.
Clean Fiber-Optic Cable Connectors
The tools required to clean fiber connectors are:
•Inspection microscope
•Type A Fiber Optic Connector Cleaner (CLETOP reel)
•Optical swab
•Optical receiver cleaning stick
Step 1 Using an inspection microscope, inspect each fiber connector for dirt, cracks, or scratches.
Step 2 Replace any damaged fiber connectors.
Note Replace all dust caps whenever the equipment is unused for 30 minutes or more.
Caution Do not reuse optical swabs. Keep unused swabs off of work surfaces.
Step 3 Clean the fiber connectors with CLETOP reel:
a. Remove the dust cap from the fiber connector.
b. Press the lever down to open the shutter door. Each time you press the lever, you expose a clean wiping surface.
c. Insert the connector into the CLETOP cleaning cassette slot, rotate one quarter turn, and gently swipe downwards.
d. Use an inspection microscope to inspect each fiber connector for dirt, cracks, or scratches. If the connector is not clean, repeat Steps a to b.
e. Insert the fiber connector into the applicable adapter or attach a dust cap to the fiber connector.
Note If you must replace a dust cap on a connector, first verify that the dust cap is clean. To clean the dust cap, wipe the outside of the cap using a dry, lint-free wipe and the inside of the dust cap using a CLETOP stick swab (14100400).
Install and Route Fiber-Optic Cables
Warning Invisible laser radiation may be emitted from disconnected fibers or connectors. Do not stare into beams or view directly with optical instruments. Statement 1051
Caution When connecting an optical fiber patch cord between the patch panel and the optical card ports in the ONS 15454, use the electrostatic discharge wristband supplied with the ONS 15454. Plug the wristband into the ESD jack on the lower right front side of the ONS 15454.
Note Always clean all fiber connectors thoroughly before making the connection with the mating adapter. Very small particles can permanently damage the end of the mating fiber inside the patch panel, which makes regular cleaning imperative. For cleaning instructions see "Fiber-Optic Connector Cleaning and Maintenance" section.
Note The patch panel features LC/UPC bulkhead adapters. Always use fiber-optic cables equipped with the corresponding (LC/UPC) connector type. Using any other type of connector results in damage to the connector and/or adapter.
Step 1 Place the LC/UPC cable connector in front of the corresponding bulkhead adapter on the front panel of the patch panel.
Step 2 Align the keyed ridge of the cable connector with the slot in the receiving adapter.
Step 3 Gently push the cable connector into the adapter until you hear a click, which indicates that the latching system is engaged.
Step 4 Route the fiber cables through the left or right fiber bend radius controller and secure them into place closing the cable retention clip. (See Figure 9.)
Mounting Cable Guide
This section contains figures that indicate the position of the cable guide for various rack configurations of the patch panel.
Diagram 1 in Figure 12 indicates mounting cable guides for a single drawer configuration when fiber routes upward. 19-inch (482.6-mm) rack is shown for reference.
Diagram 2 in Figure 12 indicates mounting cable guides when fiber routes upward. When all fibers and USB cables come out from the same side, and space is available on the frame to mount the cable guide above the drawer, the cable guide must be positioned as shown in Figure 12. Single drawer configuration is shown for reference. 19 inch rack is shown for reference.
Diagram 3 in Figure 12 indicates mounting cable guides when fiber routes downward. Each drawer will have a cable guide mounted when fiber routes downward as shown. 19-inch (482.6-mm) rack is shown for reference.

Figure 14 Fiber Protection
After the patch panel drawer is closed, velcro is wrapped around the fibers. When the fiber routes upward, the cable tie is tied around the fiber through the cable guide. When the fiber routes downward, no velcro or cable tie is needed.
Diagram 1 of Figure 15 shows velcro and cable guide tied for a single drawer configuration.
Diagram 2 of Figure 15 shows velcro and cable guide tied for a double drawer configuration.
Figure 15 Velcro and Cable Tie
Performance Monitoring
The patch panel uses Optical Test Access Port (TAP) devices to enable passive access and monitoring in the fiber-optic network. The TAPs enable network-based intrusion detection system sensors to operate efficiently without interruption. They send traffic data to a monitoring device by splitting the network signal, without introducing delay or changing the content or structure of the information contained in the packets. An OSA (Optical Spectrum Analyzer) or PM (Power Meter) can be used for optical power monitoring and optical analysis.
Table 3 shows the manufacturer-specified TAP split ratios for the TAP coupler optical power in the patch panel. The split ratio denotes the ratio of the TAP input signal to the output signal.

1 The Insertion Loss values are measured as the maximum IL inside the Operating Wavelength Bandwidth (± 80 pm, centered on each ITU wavelength of the channel).
2 Insertion Loss Uniformity is defined as the difference between the maximum insertion losses over any two operating wavelength bandwidths.
3 Adjacent Channel Isolation is defined as the difference between the maximum IL in the 100 GHz transmitted channel Bandwidth (ITU ± 80 pm) and the minimum IL measured over the Operating Wavelength Bandwidth of both adjacent 100 GHz channels.
4 Non-Adjacent Channel Isolation is defined as the difference between the maximum IL in the 100 GHz transmitted channel Bandwidth (ITU ± 80 pm) and the minimum IL measured over the Operating Wavelength Bandwidth of both non-adjacent 100 GHz channels.
5 The difference between the maximum and minimum group delay in the Operating Wavelength Bandwidth of each channel evaluated at all SOP.
6 Chromatic Dispersion is defined as the maximum of derivative of the Group Delay versus the wavelength curve in the 100GHz transmitted channel bandwidth (Operating Wavelength Bandwidth)
7 PDL (Polarization Dependent Loss) is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum IL in the 100 GHz transmitted channel Bandwidth (Operating Wavelength Bandwidth) evaluated at all SOP, measured at a given wavelength.
8 PMD (Polarization Mode Dispersion) is defined as the maximum of the DGD versus the wavelength curve in the 100 GHz transmitted channel bandwidth (Operating Wavelength Bandwidth).
9 Mux Module: Attenuation = IL1 - IL2, where IL1 = Ch1-RX to MON-MUX Insertion Loss and IL2 = Ch1-RX to COM-TX Insertion Loss.
10 Demux Module: COM-RX to MON-DMX Insertion Loss.
