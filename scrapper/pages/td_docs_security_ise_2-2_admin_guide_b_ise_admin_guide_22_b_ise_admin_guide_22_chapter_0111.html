TACACS+ Device Administration
Cisco ISE supports device administration using the Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System (TACACS+) security protocol to control and audit the configuration of network devices. The network devices are configured to query Cisco ISE for authentication and authorization of device administrator actions, and send accounting messages for Cisco ISE to log the actions. It facilitates granular control of who can access which network device and change the associated network settings. A Cisco ISE administrator can create policy sets that allow TACACS results, such as command sets and shell profiles, to be selected in authorization policy rules in a device administration access service. The Cisco ISE Monitoring node provides enhanced reports related to device administration. The Work Center menu contains all the device administration pages, which act as a single start point for ISE administrators.
Cisco ISE requires a Device Administration license to use TACACS+.
There are two types of administrators for device administration:
Device Administrator
Cisco ISE Administrator
The device administrator is the user who logs into the network devices such as switches, wireless access points, routers, and gateways, (normally through SSH), in order to perform the configuration and maintenance of the administered devices. The Cisco ISE administrator logs into Cisco ISE to configure and coordinate the devices that a device administrator logs in to.
The Cisco ISE administrator is the intended reader of this document, who logs into Cisco ISE to configure the settings that control the operations of the device administrator. The Cisco ISE administrator uses the device administration features (Work centers > Device Administration) to control and audit the configuration of the network devices. A device can be configured to query the Cisco ISE server using the Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System (TACACS) security protocol. The Cisco ISE Monitoring node provides enhanced reports related to device administration. A Cisco ISE administrator can perform the following tasks:
Configure network devices with the TACACS+ details (shared secret).
Add device administrators as internal users and set their enable passwords as needed.
Create policy sets that allow TACACS results, such as command sets and shell profiles, to be selected in authorization policy rules in a device administration access service.
Configure the TACACS server in Cisco ISE to allow device administrators to access devices based on the policy sets.
The device administrator performs the task of setting up a device to communicate with the Cisco ISE server. When a device administrator logs on to a device, the device queries the Cisco ISE server, which in turn queries an internal or external identity store, to validate the details of the device administrator. When the validation is done by the Cisco ISE server, the device informs the Cisco ISE server of the final outcome of each session or command authorization operation for accounting and auditing purposes.
A Cisco ISE administrator can manage device administration using TACACS and Cisco ISE 2.0 and later releases. The configuration related to device administration can also be migrated from a Cisco Secure Access Control System (ACS) server, versions 5.5, 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8. Prior versions need to be upgraded to 5.5 or 5.6 before migration.

Note
You should check the Enable Device Admin Service check box in the Administration > System > Deployment > General Settings page to enable TACACS+ operations. Ensure that this option is enabled in each PSN in a deployment.

Note
Cisco ISE requires a Device Administration license to use the TACACS+ service on top of an existing Base or Mobility license. The Device Administration license is a perpetual license. If you are upgrading from an earlier release to Cisco ISE Release 2.0 and later, and would like to enable the TACACS+ service, you must order the Device Administration license as a separate add-on license. You need one Device Administration license for the entire ISE deployment.

Access the Command-Line Interface to Change the Enable Password
Access the Command-Line Interface to Change the Enable Password
To change Enable password, perform the following steps:
Before you begin
Some commands are assigned to privileged mode. Therefore, they can only be executed when the device administrator has authenticated into this mode.
The device sends a special enable authentication type when the device administrator attempts to enter the privileged mode. Cisco ISE supports a separate enable password to validate this special enable authentication type. The separate enable password is used when the device administrator is authenticated with internal identity stores. For authentication with external identity stores, the same password is used as for regular login.
Procedure
Step 1
Log in to the switch.
Step 2
Press Enter to display the following prompt:
Switch>
Step 3
Execute the following commands to configure the Enable password.
Switch> enable
Password: (Press Enter to leave the password blank.)
Enter Old Password: (Enter the old password.)
Enter New Password: (Enter the new password.)
Enter New Password Confirmation: (Confirm the new password.)
Note 
If password lifetime is configured for the Login password and Enable password, the user account will be disabled if the passwords are not changed within the specified time period. If Cisco ISE is configured as TACACS+ server and the Enable Bypass option is configured on the network device, you cannot change the Enable password from the CLI (via telnet). Choose Administration > Identity Management > Identities > Users to change the Enable password for internal users.
Device Administration Work Center
The Work Center menu contains all the device administration pages, which act as a single start point for Cisco ISE administrators. However, pages that are not specific to device administration such as Users, User Identity Groups, Network Devices, Default Network Devices, Network Device Groups, Authentication and Authorization Conditions, can still be accessed from their original menu options, such as Administration. The Work Centers option is available only if the correct TACACS+ license(s) are obtained and installed.
The Device Administration Menu contains the following menu options: Overview, Identities, User Identity Groups, Ext ID Stores, Network Resources, Network Device Groups, Policy Elements, Device Admin Policy Sets, Reports, and Settings.
Data Migration from Cisco Secure ACS to Cisco ISE
You can use the migration tool to import data from ACS 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, and 5.8, and set default TACACS+ secret for all network devices. Navigate to Work Centers > Device Administration > Overview and in the Prepare section, click the migration tool link to open the migration toolDownload Software Webpage to download the migration tool. Save the tool to your PC, and from the migTool folder, run the migration.bat file to start the migration process. For complete information related to the migration, refer to the Migration Guide for your version of Cisco ISE.
Device Administration Deployment Settings
The Device Administration Deployment page ( Work Centers > Device Administration > Overview > Deployment) allows Cisco ISE administrators to centrally view the device administration system without referring to each node in the deployment section.
The Device Administration Deployment page lists the PSNs in your deployment. This simplifies the task of enabling the device admin service individually in each PSN in your deployment. You can collectively enable the device admin service for many PSNs by selecting an option below:
Option
Description
None
By default, the device administration service is disabled for all nodes.
All Policy Service Nodes
Enables the device administration service in all PSNs. With this option, new PSNs are automatically enabled for device admin when they are added.
Specific Nodes
Displays the ISE Nodes section that lists all the PSNs in your deployment. You can select the required nodes that necessitate the device admin service to be enabled.

Note
If the deployment is not licensed for TACACS+, the above options are disabled.
The TACACS Ports field allows you to enter a maximum of four TCP ports, which are comma- separated and port values range from 1 to 65535. Cisco ISE nodes and their interfaces listen for TACACS+ requests on the specified ports and you must ensure that the specified ports are not used by other services. The default TACACS+ port value is 49.
When you click Save, the changes are synchronized with the nodes specified in the Administration > System > Deployment Listing window.
Device Admin Policy Sets
A Regular policy set comprises an authentication rule table and an authorization rule table. The authentication rule table consists of a set of "outer" rules that are used to select the protocols that should be allowed. Each "outer" rule contains one or more "inner" rules that are used to select the specific identity store to use. The authorization rule table contains a set of rules to select the specific authorization results required to implement the authorization business model. Each rule consists of one or more conditions that must be matched for the rule to be engaged, and a set of command sets, and/or a shell profile, which are selected to control the authorization process. Each policy set has an authorization exceptions rule table that can be used to override the rules for specific circumstances, often the exception table is used for temporary situations.

Note
TACACS+ CHAP outbound authentication is not supported.
A Proxy Sequence policy set contains a single selected proxy sequence. If the policy set is in this mode then one or more remote proxy servers are used to process the requests (although local accounting may be configured by the Proxy Sequence).
TACACS+ Authentication Settings and Shared Secret
The following table describes the fields on the Network Devices window, which you can use to configure TACACS+ authentication settings for a network device. The navigation path is:
(For Network Devices) Work Centers > Device Administration > Network Resources > Network Devices > Add > TACACS Authentication Settings.
(For Default Devices) Work Centers > Device Administration > Network Resources > Default Devices > TACACS Authentication Settings. See Default Network Device Definition for more information.
Field Name
Usage Guidelines
Shared Secret
A string of text assigned to a network device when TACACS+ protocol is enabled. A user must enter the text before the network device authenticates a username and password. The connection is rejected until the user supplies the shared secret. This is not a mandatory field.
Retired Shared Secret is Active
Displayed when the retirement period is active.
Retire
Retires an existing shared secret instead of ending it. When you click Retire, a message box is displayed. You can either click Yes or No.
Remaining Retired Period
(Available only if you select Yes in the above message box) Displays the default value specified in the following navigation path: Work Centers > Device Administration > Settings > Connection Settings > Default Shared Secret Retirement Period. You can change the default values.
This allows a new shared secret to be entered and the old shared secret will remain active for the specified number of days.
End
(Available only if you select Yes in the above message box) Ends the retirement period and terminates the old shared secret.
Enable Single Connect Mode
Check to use a single TCP connection for all TACACS+ communication with the network device. Choose one of the following:
Legacy Cisco Devices
Or, TACACS+ Draft Compliance Single Connect Support. If you disable Single Connect Mode, ISE uses a new TCP connection for every TACACS+ request.
In summary, you can
Retire the old shared secret by specifying the retirement period as number of days (Range is 1 to 99) and at the same time set a new shared secret.
Use the old and new shared secrets during the retirement period.
Extend the retirement period before it expires.
Use the old shared secret only until the end of the retirement period.
Terminate the retirement period before it expires (click End and then Submit).

Note
Choose Administration > Network Resources > Network Devices > Add window to access the TACACS+ Authentication Settings option.
Device Administration - Authorization Policy Results
Cisco ISE administrators can use the TACACS+ command sets and TACACS+ profiles (policy results) to exercise control over the privileges and commands that are granted to a device administrator. The policy works along with the network devices and thereby prevents accidental or malicious configuration changes that may be done. In the event such changes occur, you can use the device administration audit reports to track the device administrator who has executed a particular command.

Allowed Protocols in FIPS and Non-FIPS Modes for TACACS+ Device Administration
There are many allowed authentication protocol services that Cisco ISE offers for creating the policy results. However, authentication protocol services such as PAP/ASCII, CHAP, and MS-CHAPv1, which are applicable to the TACACS+ protocol, are disabled on FIPS-enabled Cisco ISE appliances for RADIUS. As a result, these protocols cannot be enabled in the Policy > Policy Elements > Results > Allowed Protocols window to administer devices, when using a FIPS-enabled (Administration > System Settings > FIPS Mode) Cisco ISE appliance.
Consequently, to configure PAP/ASCII, CHAP, and MS-CHAPv1 protocols in your device administration policy results, for both FIPS and non-FIPS modes, you must navigate to the Work Centers > Device Administration > Policy Elements > Results > Allowed Protocols window. Only the Default Device Admin allowed protocols setting may be used when FIPS mode is enabled. This option is not allowed in RADIUS.
TACACS+ Command Sets
Command sets enforce the specified list of commands that can be executed by a device administrator. When a device administrator issues operational commands on a network device, Cisco ISE is queried to determine whether the administrator is authorized to issue these commands. This is also referred to as command authorization.
Wildcards and Regex in Command Sets
Command Line and Command Set List Match
Process Rules with Multiple Command Sets
Wildcards and Regex in Command Sets
A command line comprises the command and zero or more arguments. When Cisco ISE receives a command line (request), it handles the command and its arguments in different ways:
It matches the command in the request with the commands specified in the command set list using the wildcard matching paradigm.
Example: Sh?? or S*
It matches the arguments in the request with the arguments specified in the command set list using regular expressions (regex) matching paradigm.
Example: Show interface[1-4] port[1-9]:tty*
Command Line and Command Set List Match
To match a requested command line to a command set list containing wildcards and regex:
Iterate over a command set list to detect matching commands.
Wildcard matching permits:
Case insensitivity
Any character in the command in the command set may be "?", which matches any individual character that must exist in the requested command
Any character in the command in the command set may be "*", which matches zero or more characters in the requested command
Examples:
Request
Command Set
Matches
Comments
show
show
Y
—
show
SHOW
Y
Case insensitive
show
Sh??
Y
Matches any character
show
Sho??
N
Second "?" intersects with the character that does not exist
show
S*
Y
"*" matches any character
show
S*w
Y
"*" matches characters "ho"
show
S*p
N
Character "p" does not correspond
For each matching command, Cisco ISE validates the arguments.
The command set list will include a space-delimited set of arguments for each command.
Example: Show interface[1-4] port[1-9]:tty.*
This command has two arguments.
1. Argument 1: interface[1-4]
2. Argument 2: port[1-9]:tty.*
The command arguments in the request are taken in the position-significant order they appear in the packet. If all the arguments in the command definition match the arguments in the request, then this command/argument is said to be matched. Note that any extraneous arguments in the request are ignored.

Note
Use the standard Unix regular expressions in arguments.
Process Rules with Multiple Command Sets
If a command set contains a match for the command and its arguments, and the match has Deny Always, Cisco ISE designates the command set as Commandset-DenyAlways.
If there is no Deny Always for a command match in a command set, Cisco ISE checks all the commands in the command set sequentially for the first match.
If the first match has Permit, Cisco ISE designates the command set as Commandset-Permit.
If the first match has Deny, Cisco ISE designates the command set as Commandset-Deny.
After Cisco ISE has analyzed all the command sets, it authorizes the command:
If Cisco ISE designated any command set as Commandset-DenyAlways, Cisco ISE denies the command.
If there is no Commandset-DenyAlways, Cisco ISE permits the command if any command set is Commandset-Permit; otherwise, Cisco ISE denies the command. The only exception is when the Unmatched check box is checked.
TACACS+ Profile
TACACS+ profiles control the initial login session of the device administrator. A session refers to each individual authentication, authorization, or accounting request. A session authorization request to a network device elicits a Cisco ISE response. The response includes a token that is interpreted by the network device, which limits the commands that may be executed for the duration of a session. The authorization policy for a device administration access service can contain a single shell profile and multiple command sets. The TACACS+ profile definitions are split into two components:
Common tasks
Custom attributes
There are two views in the TACACS+ Profiles window ( Work Centers > Device Administration > Policy Elements > Results > TACACS Profiles), Task Attribute View and Raw View. Common tasks can be entered using the Task Attribute View and custom attributes can be created in the Task Attribute View as well as the Raw View.
The Common Tasks section allows you to select and configure the frequently used attributes for a profile. The attributes that are included here are those defined by the TACACS+ protocol draft specifications. However, the values can be used in the authorization of requests from other services. In the Task Attribute View, the Cisco ISE administrator can set the privileges that will be assigned to the device administrator. The common task types are:
Shell
WLC
Nexus
Generic
The Custom Attributes section allows you to configure additional attributes. It provides a list of attributes that are not recognized by the Common Tasks section. Each definition consists of the attribute name, an indication of whether the attribute is mandatory or optional, and the value for the attribute.

Note
You can define a total of 24 task attributes for TACACS-enabled network devices. If you define more than 24 task attributes, none of them are sent to TACACS-enabled network devices.
In the Raw View, you can enter the mandatory attributes using a equal to (=) sign between the attribute name and its value and optional attributes are entered using an asterisk (*) between the attribute name and its value. The attributes entered in the Raw View section are reflected in the Custom Attributes section in the Task Attribute View and vice versa. The Raw View section is also used to copy and paste the attribute list (for example, another product's attribute list) from the clipboard onto Cisco ISE. Custom attributes can be defined for nonshell services.

Click Done.
Step 6
Create the required Authentication policy, (for example, Name: ATN_Internal_Users, Rule: if DEVICE:Location EQUALS Location #All Locations#Europe, Condition: Allow Protocols: Device_Admin_protocols and Default: Use Internal Users—The policy matches only devices that are in location Europe, allows protocols that are defined under device admin protocols, and authenticates against the internal users).
Step 7
Create the required Authorization Policy.
Example 1: Rule Name: Sys_Admin_rule, Conditions: if SysAdmin and TACACS User Equals ABC then cmd_Sys_Admin AND Profile_priv_8—The policy matches system administrators with user name ABC and allows the specified commands to be executed and assigns a privilege level of 8.
Example 2: Rule Name: HelpDesk AND TACACS User EQUALS XYZ then cmd_HDesk_show AND cmd_HDesk_ping AND Profile_priv_1—The policy matches system administrators with user name XYZ and allows the specified commands to be executed and assigns a privilege level of 1.
In the above examples:
The command sets, cmd_Sys_Admin and cmd_HDesk, are created in the Work Centers > Device Administration > Policy Elements > Results >TACACS Command Sets > Add window.
The TACACS profiles, Profile_Priv_1 and Profile_priv_8, are created in the Work Centers > Device Administration > Policy Elements > Results > TACACS Profiles > Add window.
Note 
It is recommended that the policy results are created prior to the creation of the policy set such that it will be readily available when creating the authorization results.
Step 8
Click Submit to create the new policy set.
