The following documents may be helpful when configuring Secure Firewall Management Center deployments, Version 6.0+.

Note
Some of the linked documents are not applicable to Secure Firewall Management Center deployments. For example, some links on Secure Firewall Threat Defense pages are specific to deployments managed by Secure Firewall device manager, and some links on hardware pages are unrelated to management center. To avoid confusion, pay careful attention to document titles. Also, some documents cover multiple products and therefore may appear on multiple product pages.
