Chapter: Multi-Gigabit Fabric on the Router
Chapter Contents
Cisco 3900 series, Cisco 2900 series, and Cisco 1900 series ISRs use a multi-gigabit fabric (MGF) for the new modules and interface cards to inter-communicate on the router. Legacy modules that support Cisco High-Speed Intrachassis Module Interconnect (HIMI) also support the MGF. Next generation module drivers integrate with the MGF to perform port configurations, configure packet flow, and control traffic buffering. On the router-side, there are no user-configurable features on the MGF. All configurations are performed from the module, which may or may not lead to changes on the MGF.
Modules and interface cards inter-communicate using the MGF on the router with or without CPU involvement. Modules and interface cards that communicate without CPU involvement reduce load and increase performance on the router. Modules and interface cards that do not utilize the MGF communicate with the CPU using the PCI Express (PCIe) link.
The following sections describe module and interface card communication through the MGF:

Restrictions for Module and Interface Card Communication
Cisco 1941W
The wireless LAN (WLAN) module is only supported on the Cisco 1941W ISR.
Maximum Number of Legacy Switch Modules
A maximum of two integrated switch modules are supported when a legacy module is present in the system. In this scenario, the two switch modules have to be externally stacked.
Supported Slots, Modules, and Interface Cards
The following slots support communication through the MGF:
Service module (SM)
Enhanced high-speed WAN interface card (EHWIC)
Internal service module (ISM)
The following modules and interface cards support communication through the MGF:
Wireless LAN Module in the Cisco 1941W ISR
Cisco Etherswitch Service Modules
Cisco 3900 Series, Cisco 2900 Series, and Cisco 1900 Series Integrated Services Routers support legacy interface cards and modules. Some modules will require an adapter. See your router’s hardware installation guide at Cisco.com for adapter installation information.
See the routers’s Product page at Cisco.com for a complete list of supported new and legacy modules.
Wireless LAN Module in the Cisco 1941W ISR
When configured as an autonomous access point, the wireless LAN (WLAN) device serves as the connection point between wireless and wired networks or as the center point of a stand-alone wireless network. In large installations, wireless users within radio range of a device can roam throughout a facility while maintaining seamless and uninterrupted access to the network.
Cisco 1941W supports ISM-to-EHWIC communication with an integrated switch communicating through the MGF. In this scenario traffic goes from the WLAN, through the Multi-Gigabit Fabric’s CPU port, and out through a port on the front panel.
Cisco Etherswitch Service Modules
The following Cisco EtherSwitch service modules provide Cisco modular access routers the ability to stack Cisco EtherSwitch service modules as Layer 2 switches using Cisco StackWise technology.
NME-16ES-1G
NME-16ES-1G-P
NME-X-23ES-1G
NME-X-23ES-1G-P
NME-XD-48ES-2S-P
NME-XD-24ES-1S-P
The Cisco EtherSwitch service modules are supported by either the IP base image (formerly known as standard multilayer image [SMI]) or the IP services image (formerly known as the enhanced multilayer image [EMI]).
The IP base image provides Layer 2+ features, including access control lists, quality of service (QoS), static routing, and the Routing Information Protocol (RIP). The IP services image provides a richer set of enterprise-class features, including Layer 2+ features and full Layer 3 routing (IP unicast routing, IP multicast routing, and fallback bridging). To distinguish it from the Layer 2+ static routing and RIP, the IP services image includes protocols such as the Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) and the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Protocol.
Cisco 3900 Series, Cisco 2900 Series, and Cisco 1900 Series Integrated Services Routers support the following Cisco EtherSwitch service modules for SM-to-SM or SM-to-ISM communication.
NME-16ES-1G
NME-16ES-1G-P
NME-X-23ES-1G
NME-X-23ES-1G-P
NME-XD-48ES-2S-P
NME-XD-24ES-1S-P
See the Cisco EtherSwitch Feature Guide documentation at Cisco.com for configuration details, http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_3t/12_3t14/feature/guide/miragenm.html#wp1787811.
Cisco High-Speed Intrachassis Module Interconnect (HIMI)
Cisco 3900 series and Cisco 2900 series routers use Cisco High-Speed Intrachassis Module Interconnect (HIMI) to support SM-to-SM or SM-to-ISM communication through the MGF.
Use the connect connection-name module Module1 Channel-id1 module Module2 Channel-id2 command to establish a maximum of two HIMI connections on the Cisco 3900 series ISR routers and one HIMI connection on Cisco 2900 series andCisco 1900 series ISRs. Module 1 and Module 2 are the slot/port of the two modules. The Channel-id1 and Channel-id2 variables must always have a value of 0.
When two modules are configured in a HIMI connection, the modules cannot send traffic to any other module except its HIMI-dedicated partner.
See Cisco High-Speed Intrachassis Module Interconnect (HIMI) Configuration Guide at Cisco.com for detailed configuration instructions, http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_4/12_4_mainline/srdesfm1.html.
Note See the module documentation to validate HIMI support.
Using HIMI for VLAN Traffic Flows
For HIMI configurations, the port-level VLAN memberships are ignored on the Multi-Gigabit Fabric (MGF). Use the connect connection-name module module1 vlan-id module module2 command to redirect VLAN traffic flows from SM-to-SM or SM-to-ISM connections on the MGF.
The following two modules, as well as others, support VLAN traffic redirection:
Cisco Etherswitch service module
Cisco Services Ready Engine internal service module (ISM-SRE)
Note See the module documentation to validate HIMI support.
Viewing Platform Information
The following sections explain how to view VLAN, slot, module, interface card, and MGF statistics on the router.
Viewing VLAN and Slot Assignments
Viewing Module and Interface Card Status on the Router
Viewing Multi-Gigabit Fabric Statistics
Viewing VLAN and Slot Assignments
Slots on the router are optionally assigned to VLANs. From privileged EXEC mode, enter the show platform mgf command, then press Enter to display VLAN and slot assignments on the router. An asterisk next to the slot indicates that the vlan is the slot's default VLAN. The following example displays output from a Cisco 3945 ISR.
Note VLAN1 is the default when no other VLAN are listed.

  Viewing Module and Interface Card Status on the Router
Multi-gigabit Fabric (MGF) displays module and interface card details. To show the details of the MGF, use the show platform mgf command in privileged EXEC mode.
The following example displays the output for the show platform mgf module command when entered on a Cisco 3945 ISR. Table 1 displays the information code that appears in the output.
