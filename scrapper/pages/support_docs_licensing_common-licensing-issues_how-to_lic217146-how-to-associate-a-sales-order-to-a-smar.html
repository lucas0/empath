Associating a Sales Order to a Smart Account
Option 1: Assign a Smart Account while you are entering initial order details.
Note: By assigning at the header level of the entire order, all licenses in your order will be assigned to the same Smart Account.
Step 1:
Go to Cisco Commerce Workspace and log in with your Cisco.com account.
Step 2:
From the menu bar, select Orders, and then Create Order.
Step 3:
On the Create an Order page, select whether you want to continue with or without a deal ID. Click Continue.
Note: For the purpose of this scenario, the Without a Deal ID option is selected.
Step 4:
On the Create Order page, fill in all the mandatory fields, and then click Continue.
Step 5:
In the Smart Account section of the order, click Assign Smart Account.
Step 6:
In the Assign Smart Account dialog box, on the End Customer Smart Account tab, enter Domain Identifier or Email ID of the End Customer Smart Account. Additionally, if applicable, select a Virtual Account. Click Assign.
Note: You can also assign a Partner Holding Account on the Smart Account Types tab. Partners use this account if the customer does not have a Smart Account. Partners can then request a Smart Account for them by clicking the Request New Holding Account button.
Note: In the Suggested Smart Account for End Customer section, you can see suggested Smart Accounts based on the End Customer information you entered.
Step 7:
Once the assignment process is complete, you can continue with the normal ordering process.
Option 2: Assign a Smart Account while you are adding licenses and license stock-keeping units (SKUs) to an order.
Note: By assigning at the header level, all licenses within the order will be assigned to the same Smart Account. By assigning at the line item level, individual Smart Accounts can be assigned to individual licenses within the order.
Step 1:
On the Orders tab, click Items and add your licenses by typing License ID or SKU in the search bar, chose the Quantity, and select Add.
Step result: The system displays the added licenses in the list at the bottom of the page.
Step 2:
You can assign a Smart Account in two ways:
At the header level by clicking Assign Smart Account at the top of the page. Step result: The system assigns all of the licenses to the same End Customer Smart Account or Partner Holding Account that you selected.
At the line item level by selecting the Items tab, and then clicking Assign Smart Account for each license. Step result: The system assigns the individual licenses within the order to different Smart Accounts.
Step 3:
In the Assign Smart Account dialog box, on the End Customer Smart Account tab, enter Domain Identifier or Email ID of the End Customer Smart Account. Additionally, if applicable, select a Virtual Account. Click Assign.
Note: You can also assign a Partner Holding Account on the Smart Account Types tab. Partners use this account if the customer does not have a Smart Account. Partners can then request a Smart Account for them by clicking the Request New Holding Account button.
Note: In the Suggested Smart Account for End Customer section, you can see suggested Smart Accounts based on the End Customer information you entered.
Step 4:
Once the assignment process is complete, you can continue with the normal ordering process.
