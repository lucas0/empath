Problem Description
For all affected versions of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) and Cisco Network Admission Control (NAC), posture updates and client provisioning resource downloads will fail if they are manually configured with a Perfigo.com domain URL.
Posture updates will fail if the Update Feed URL field points to https://www.perfigo.com/ise/posture-update.xml.
Client provisioning resource downloads will fail if the Update Feed URL field points to https://www.perfigo.com/ise/provisioning-update.xml.
Background
On 2020-02-17, posture update files and client provisioning resources hosted on Cisco’s Perfigo.com web server will no longer be accessible. Corrective action is only required if the default configuration URL was altered.
For ISE Release 2.4 and later, the correct default configuration URLs are:
https://www.cisco.com/web/secure/spa/posture-update.xml
https://www.cisco.com/web/secure/spa/provisioning-update.xml
For ISE Release 2.3 and earlier, the correct default configuration URLs are:
https://www.cisco.com/web/secure/pmbu/posture-update.xml 
https://www.cisco.com/web/secure/pmbu/provisioning-update.xml
Problem Symptom
If posture updates and client provisioning resource downloads continue to point to the Perfigo URL after the Perfigo web server is taken offline, these error messages will be seen:
