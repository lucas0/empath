Enable Your Switch to Support Standard Web Authentication
Ensure that you include the following commands in your switch configuration to enable standard web authentication functions for Cisco ISE, including provisions for URL redirection upon authentication:
ip classless


ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.1.2.3


ip http server

! Must enable HTTP/HTTPS for URL-redirection on port 80/443

ip http secure-server 
Define Local Username and Password for Synthetic RADIUS Transactions
Enter the following command to enable the switch to talk to the Cisco ISE node as though it is the RADIUS server for this network segment:
username test-radius password 0 abcde123 
Configure NTP Server for Accurate Log and Accounting Timestamps
Ensure that you specify the same NTP server on the switch as you have set in Cisco ISE by entering the following command:
ntp server <IP_address>|<domain_name> 
Command to Enable AAA Functions
Enter the following commands on the switch to enable the various AAA functions between the switch and Cisco ISE, including 802.1X and MAB authentication functions:
aaa new-model

! Creates an 802.1X port-based authentication method list

aaa authentication dot1x default group radius

! Required for VLAN/ACL assignment

aaa authorization network default group radius

! Authentication & authorization for webauth transactions

aaa authorization auth-proxy default group radius

! Enables accounting for 802.1X and MAB authentications

aaa accounting dot1x default start-stop group radius

!

aaa session-id common

!

aaa accounting update periodic 5


! Update AAA accounting information periodically every 5 minutes


aaa accounting system default start-stop group radius

!

 
RADIUS Server Configuration on the Switch
Configure the switch to interact with Cisco ISE as the RADIUS source server by entering the following commands:
!
radius-server <ISE Name> 

! ISE Name is the name of the ISE PSN

address ipv4 <ip address> auth-port 1812 acct-port 1813  

! IP address is the address of the PSN. This example uses the standard RADIUS ports. 

key <passwd> 

! passwd is the secret password confiugured in Cisco ISE

exit 

Note
We recommend that you configure a dead-criteria time of 30 seconds with 3 retries to provide longer response times for RADIUS requests that use Active Directory for authentication.
Enable Switch to Handle RADIUS Change of Authorization (CoA)
Specify the settings to ensure the switch can appropriately handle RADIUS CoA behavior and related posture functions on Cisco ISE by entering the following commands:
aaa server radius dynamic-author client <ISE-IP> server-key 0 abcde123 

Note
Cisco ISE uses port 1700 (Cisco IOS software default) versus RFC default port 3799 for CoA. Existing Cisco Secure ACS 5.x customers may already have this set to port 3799 if they use CoA as part of an existing ACS implementation.
secret key should be the same as the one configured on Cisco ISE while adding a network device and the IP address should be a PSN IP address.
Enable Device Tracking and DHCP Snooping on Switch Ports
To help provide optional security-oriented functions from Cisco ISE, enable device tracking and DHCP snooping for IP substitution in dynamic ACLs on switch ports by entering the following commands:
! Optional
 ip dhcp snooping

! Required!

! Configure Device Tracking Policy!device-tracking policy <DT_POLICY_NAME>no protocol ndp tracking enable

! Bind it to interface!interface <interface_id>device-tracking attach-policy<DT_POLICY_NAME> 
In RADIUS accounting, the DHCP attributes are not sent by the IOS sensor to Cisco ISE even when DHCP snooping is enabled. In such cases, DHCP snooping should be enabled on the VLAN to make the DHCP active.
Use the following commands to enable DHCP snooping on VLAN:
ip dhcp snooping 
ip dhcp snooping vlan 1-100 
Enable 802.1X Port-Based Authentication for Switch Ports
Enter the following commands to turn on 802.1X authentication for switch ports, globally:
dot1x system-auth-control 
Enable EAP for Critical Authentications
To support supplicant authentication requests over the LAN, enable EAP for critical authentications (Inaccessible Authentication Bypass) by entering the following command:
dot1x critical eapol 
Throttle AAA Requests Using Recovery Delay
In the case of a critical authentication recovery, configure the switch to automatically introduce an authentication delay (in milliseconds) to ensure Cisco ISE can launch services again after recovery. Use the following command:
authentication critical recovery delay 1000 
VLAN Definitions Based on Enforcement States
Enter the following commands to define the VLAN names, numbers, and Switch Virtual Interfaces (SVIs) based on known enforcement states in your network. Create the respective VLAN interfaces to enable routing between networks. This can be especially helpful to handle multiple sources of traffic passing over the same network segments from both the endpoints (such as PC, laptop) and the IP phone through which the endpoint is connected to the network, for example:
 

vlan <VLAN_number> 
name ACCESS!
vlan <VLAN_number> 
name VOICE

!
interface <VLAN_number> 
description ACCESS 
ip address 10.1.2.3 255.255.255.0 
ip helper-address <DHCP_Server_IP_address> 
ip helper-address <Cisco_ISE_IP_address>

!
interface <VLAN_number> 
description VOICE 
ip address 10.2.3.4 255.255.255.0 
ip helper-address <DHCP_Server_IP_address>   
Local (Default) Access List (ACL) Definitions on the Switch
Enable these functions on older switches (with Cisco IOS software releases earlier than 12.2(55)SE) to ensure Cisco ISE is able to perform the dynamic ACL updates required for authentication and authorization by entering the following commands:
ip access-list extended ACL-ALLOW

 permit ip any any

!

ip access-list extended ACL-DEFAULT

  remark DHCP

  permit udp any eq bootpc any eq bootps

  remark DNS

  permit udp any any eq domain

  remark Ping

  permit icmp any any

  remark Ping

  permit icmp any any

  remark PXE / TFTP

  permit udp any any eq tftp

  remark Allow HTTP/S to ISE and WebAuth portal 
permit tcp any host <Cisco_ISE_IP_address> eq www 

permit tcp any host <Cisco_ISE_IP_address> eq 443 

permit tcp any host <Cisco_ISE_IP_address> eq 8443 

permit tcp any host <Cisco_ISE_IP_address> eq 8905 

permit udp any host <Cisco_ISE_IP_address> eq 8905 

permit udp any host <Cisco_ISE_IP_address> eq 8906 

permit tcp any host <Cisco_ISE_IP_address> eq 8080 

permit udp any host <Cisco_ISE_IP_address> eq 9996 

remark Drop all the rest

  deny ip any any log 


!

! The ACL to allow URL-redirection for WebAuth
 ip access-list extended ACL-WEBAUTH-REDIRECT 

 permit tcp any any eq www

 permit tcp any any eq 443  

Note
This configuration on the Wireless Controller may increase CPU utilization and raises the risk of system instability. This is an IOS issue and does not adversely affect Cisco ISE.
Enable Switch Ports for 802.1X and MAB
To enable switch ports for 802.1X and MAB:
Procedure
Step 1
Enter the interface configuration mode for all of the access switch ports:
interface range FastEthernet0/1-8
Step 2
Enable the switch ports for access mode (instead of trunk mode):
switchport mode access
Step 3
Statically configure the access VLAN. This provides local provisioning for the access VLANs and is required for open-mode authentication:
switchport access vlan <VLAN_number>
Step 4
Statically configure the voice VLAN:
switchport voice vlan <VLAN_number>
Step 5
Enable open-mode authentication. Open mode allows traffic to be bridged onto the data and voice VLANs before authentication is completed. We strongly recommend using a port-based ACL in a production environment to prevent unauthorized access.
Enabling open-mode authentication also allows pre-authentication access before the AAA server response, subject to the port ACL.
authentication open
Step 6
Apply a port-based ACL to determine which traffic should be bridged by default from unauthenticated endpoints onto the access VLAN. Because you should allow all access first and enforce policy later, you should apply ACL-ALLOW to permit all traffic through the switch port. You have already created a default Cisco ISE authorization to allow all traffic for now because we want complete visibility and do not want to impact the existing end-user experience yet.
An ACL must be configured to prepend dynamic ACLs from the AAA server.
ip access-group ACL-ALLOW in
Note
  Before Cisco IOS software Release 12.2(55)SE on DSBU switches, a port ACL is required for dynamic ACLs from a RADIUS AAA server to be applied. Failure to have a default ACL will result in assigned dynamic ACLs being ignored by the switch. With Cisco IOS software Release 12.2(55)SE, a default ACL will be automatically generated and applied.
Note
  We are using ACL-ALLOW at this point in the lab because we want to enable 802.1X port-based authentication, but without any impact on the existing network. In a later exercise, we will apply a different ACL-DEFAULT, which blocks undesired traffic for a production environment.
Step 7
Enable Multi-Auth host mode. Multi-Auth is essentially a superset of Multi-Domain Authentication (MDA). MDA only allows a single endpoint in the data domain. When multi-auth is configured, a single authenticated phone is allowed in the voice domain (as with MDA) but an unlimited number of data devices can be authenticated in the data domain.
Allow voice and multiple endpoints on the same physical access port
authentication host-mode multi-auth
Note
  Multiple data devices (whether virtualized devices or physical devices connected to a hub) behind an IP phone can exacerbate the access ports’ physical link-state awareness.
Step 8
Enable various authentication method options with the following commands:
Enable re-authentication:
authentication periodic
Enable re-authentication via RADIUS Session-Timeout:
authentication timer reauthenticate server
authentication event fail action next-method
Configure critical authentication vlan method in case of dead server:
authentication event server dead action reinitialize vlan <VLAN_number>
authentication event server alive action reinitialize
Configure IOS Flex-Auth authentication for 802.1X and MAB:
authentication order dot1x mab
authentication priority dot1x mab
Step 9
Enable 802.1X port control on the switchport:
authentication port-control auto
authentication violation restrict
Step 10
Enable MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB):
mab
Step 11
Enable 802.1X on the switchport:
dot1x pae authenticator
Step 12
Set the retransmit period to 10 seconds:
dot1x timeout tx-period 10
Note
  The 802.1X tx-period timeout should be set to 10 seconds. Do not change this unless you understand the implications.
Step 13
Enable the portfast feature:
spanning-tree portfast

Enable EPM Logging
Set up standard logging functions on the switch to support possible troubleshooting and recording for Cisco ISE functions:
epm logging 
Enable Switch to Receive SNMP Traps
Ensure the switch can receive SNMP trap transmissions from Cisco ISE over the appropriate VLAN in this network segment:
snmp-server community public RO 
snmp-server trap-source <VLAN_number> 
Enable SNMP v3 Query for Profiling on Switch
Configure the switch to ensure SNMP v3 polling takes place as intended to support Cisco ISE profiling services using the following commands. Before that configure the SNMP settings in the Cisco ISE GUI in the SNMP Settings window. To view this window, click the Menu icon () and chooseAdministration > Network Resources > Network Devices > Add | Edit > SNMP Settings.
Snmp-server user <name> <group> v3 auth md5 <string> priv des <string> 
snmp-server group  <group> v3 priv 
snmp-server group <group> v3 priv contextvlan-1  

Note
The snmp-server group <group> v3 priv context vlan-1 command must be configured for each context. The snmp show context command lists all the context information.
If the SNMP request times out and there is no connectivity issue, then you can increase the timeout value.
Enable MAC Notification Traps for Profiler to Collect
Configure your switch to transmit the appropriate MAC notification traps so that the Cisco ISE profiler function can collect information on network endpoints:
mac address-table notification change 
mac address-table notification mac-move 
snmp trap mac-notification change added 
snmp trap mac-notification change removed 
Configure RADIUS Idle-Timeout on the Switch
To configure the RADIUS idle-timeout on a switch, use the following command:
Switch(config-if)# authentication timer inactivity 
where inactivity is the interval of inactivity in seconds, after which the client activity is considered unauthorized.
In Cisco ISE, you can enable this option for any authorization policies to which such a session inactivity timer should apply. In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Policy > Policy Elements > Results > Authorization > Authorization Profiles.
Wireless Controller Configuration for iOS Supplicant Provisioning
For Single SSID
To support Apple iOS-based devices (iPhone or iPad) switching from one SSID to another on the same wireless access point, configure the Wireless Controller to enable the FAST SSID change function. This function helps ensure iOS-based devices can switch between SSIDs quickly.
For Dual SSID BYOD
Fast SSID must be enabled to support dual SSID BYOD. When fast SSID changing is enabled, the Wireless Controller allows clients to move faster between SSIDs. When fast SSID is enabled, the client entry is not cleared and the delay is not enforced. For more information about configuring fast SSID on a Cisco Wireless Controller, see the Cisco Wireless Controller Configuration Guide.
Example Wireless Controller Configuration
WLC (config)# FAST SSID change 
You might see the following error message while trying to connect to a wireless network for some of the Apple iOS-based devices:
Could not scan for Wireless Networks.
You can ignore this error message because this does not affect the authentication of the device.
Configure ACLs on Wireless Controllers for MDM Interoperability
Configure ACLs on the Wireless Controller for use in an authorization policy to redirect nonregistered devices and certificate provisioning. Your ACLs must be in the following sequence.
Procedure
Step 1
Allow all outbound traffic from the server to the client.
Step 2
(Optional) Allow ICMP inbound traffic from the client to the server for troubleshooting.
Step 3
Allow access to the MDM server for unregistered and noncompliant devices to download the MDM agent and proceed with compliance checks.
Step 4
Allow all inbound traffic from the client to the server to Cisco ISE for the web portal and supplicant, and certificate provisioning flows.
Step 5
Allow inbound Domain Name System (DNS) traffic from the client to the server for name resolution.
Step 6
Allow inbound DHCP traffic from the client to the server for IP addresses.
Step 7
Deny all inbound traffic from the client to the server to corporate resources for redirection to Cisco ISE (as per your company policy).
Step 8
(Optional) Permit the rest of the traffic.
Example
The following example shows the ACLs for redirecting a nonregistered device to the BYOD flow. In this example, the Cisco ISE IP address is 10.35.50.165, the internal corporate network IP addresses are 192.168.0.0 and 172.16.0.0 (to redirect), and the MDM server subnet is 204.8.168.0.
