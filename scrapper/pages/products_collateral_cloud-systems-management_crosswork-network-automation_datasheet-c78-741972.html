    The Cisco Crosswork Cloud Trust Insights™ module is a cloud service that provides operational intelligence on integrity and security posture of Cisco IOS® XR devices. The service brings together Cisco’s Knowledge and Trust Anchor technologies combined with customer devices to provide a holistic view of the trustworthy status of their network assets.
Product overview
Network infrastructure drives mission-critical services. Understanding the complex hardware and software environment supporting critical infrastructure devices is an important part of network operations, but the tools to track and test integrity of the software on these devices is often limited to simple tools that query device OS versions and configurations. Today’s mission-critical environments need the ability to not only help operators better track and understand the complex software components required to maintain and operate network devices, but also validate the integrity of the software supporting these mission-critical services.
Cisco Crosswork Trust Insights is a software-as-a-service solution that provides intuitive visualization, rich analytics, and alerts on actionable device integrity events. It empowers you with visibility to help assess the integrity and affirm trust in your network routing infrastructure. It aggregates hardware and software signature information from your network devices and gathers evidence to validate if the hardware is authentic and running software maps to published Known Good Values (KGVs). The service enables you to take maximum advantage of the trustworthy technologies baked into the Cisco platforms and implement operational best practices to collect and validate changes in system integrity information.
Crosswork Trust Insights offers an IOS XR network device monitoring solution for complex enterprise and service provider networks. The solution supports IOS XR software and hardware systems. The Crosswork Trust Insights solution captures, enriches, and analyzes trustworthy network equipment status to help service providers, web companies, and enterprises to validate the integrity of their network infrastructure assets. A trustworthy network is one that continues to ensure performance, reduce management costs, gain deep visibility, and reduce downtime caused by malicious or noncompliant changes.

Product description
Crosswork Cloud Trust Insights is Cisco’s first cloud-based service that presents continuous and verifiable network device integrity information. It uses secure data exchange protocols in combination with a cloud-native architecture to continuously monitor changes to device trust posture. In addition, the service takes advantage of its deeper knowledge of Cisco network devices to provide a comprehensive view of device inventory and changes in system integrity measurements.
Cisco is committed to continually enhance the security and resilience of our networking solutions. Trust Insights uniquely leverages the built-in trust technologies. For example, it utilizes the cryptographic identity as part of a trust anchor for the validation of information collected from the device. In addition, the service provides an independent and secure offsite repository of system integrity information.
Trust Insights delivers the critical consumer experience component as part of the Cisco Trust Anchor technology evolution.
Accelerate time to know
Cisco Crosswork Trust Insights helps to detect and analyze any change in system integrity measurements. As a result it significantly reduces the Mean Time to Know (MTTK) when a security event occurs. Operators can subscribe to such change notifications to help accelerate Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR). The service is built to communicate and alert on issues using new collaboration media platforms and legacy methods such as email. These collaborative tools help network operation teams efficiently coordinate their efforts to resolve issues. The framework is able to support integration with third-party plug-ins to facilitate collaboration. Efficiency will further be improved with alarms to trigger automation playbooks to implement remediation or accessibility actions.
Figure 1.            
Accelerate Time to Action
Crosswork Cloud Trust Insights leverages the robust Cisco Cloud Service Infrastructure.
Cisco Crosswork Trust Insights is designed to cost-effectively manage very large-scale data sets. It utilizes the scalability of the Cisco Crosswork Cloud Service Infrastructure to achieve this. The architecture is capable of tracking millions of signature value pairs while maintaining their historical information. It delivers a solution that is flexible, resilient, and secure.
In summary, Trust Insights is for anyone who needs to understand the trust posture of their network routers and track and analyze changes that may potentially expose the attack surface. The service will continue to evolve, providing organizations with the capability to protect and monitor the trust posture of their network assets.

Trust Insights use cases
Figure 2.            
Crosswork Trust Insights Use Cases
IOS XR inventory and integrity analytics
Trust Insights provides an operational timeline for all events captured within the trust dossier (such as reboot or configuration rollback events), as well as dossier collection, and also observed changes between dossiers. This is designed to provide a unique historical view into changes observed in systems, which is intended to support root-cause analysis of known network issues, or to prove that scheduled hardware or software maintenance has been completed as planned.
Figure 3.            
Track changes and events with trust dossier
Integrity measurement and KGVs
Trust Insights works by leveraging the “trust dossier” feature within IOS XR 7 systems. This cryptographically signed dossier contains data on the hardware and software inventory of the router, as well as unique measurements of hardware and runtime software within each IOS XR device. These runtime signatures are compared to KGVs, which are collected as part of the IOS XR build and release process as part of the Trust Insights service. With Trust Insights, you can not only understand the current and previous hardware and software running on your production systems, but you can also get a unique view into the integrity of all hardware and software running in your mission-critical production network devices.
Figure 4.            
Integrity measurement and Known Good Values
Forensic reporting on observed software signatures
Trust Insights highlights critical new security capabilities of modern Cisco routers and can provide insights into new capabilities enabled by upgrading to newer software versions of the IOS XR operating system. The integrity reporting capabilities can validate IOS XR software packages, detect runtime changes to file contents on production systems, and file signatures across monitored devices within your environment. Trust Insights leverages key capabilities in the IOS XR operating system to track and report on the integrity and runtime changes to individual software packages as well as at-rest and in-use file fingerprints.
Figure 5.            
Integrity reporting capabilities
Trust capability assessment
Trust Insights provides unique insights into security capabilities of your IOS XR fleet. This feature helps you audit the security capabilities of already-deployed IOS XR systems to identify opportunities to mitigate risks through upgrades.
Figure 6.            
Audit security capabilities with Trust Insights
Historical audit of operational changes
Trust Insights provides a historical audit trail of measured systems and can track and report on observed changes to hardware and running software over time. This is a critical capability to ensure compliance with approved software releases and patch (SMU) standards, as well as forensic capabilities to report on exact software state and observed changes during previous operational events.
Figure 7.            
Historical audit trail
Secure remote collection and storage
