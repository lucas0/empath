Insert Power Supply
Use this procedure to insert the power supply units.
Figure 1. Insert Power Supply
1
Insert the PSU into the cage on the rear side of the unit in the direction shown (slots 0 or 1)
2
The PSU connecting PCB must always face the bottom during insertion
3
Direction to insert the power supply
Remove Power Supply

Note
The inlet temperature of system during replacement must be less than 40 deg Celsius at sea level. The replacement time decreases for higher altitudes.

Note
In case of PSU failure, the failed PSU needs to be physically replaced within 2 minutes.

Figure 3. Remove Power Supply
1
Release the lock of the PSU in the direction shown and pull the PSU gently using the handle.
Insert Fans
Use this procedure to insert the fans.
Figure 4. Insert Fans


1
Push the fan into the fan slot as shown (slots 0, 1, 2, or 3)
2
Ensure that the fan connector always faces upwards
Remove Fans

Note
Cisco NCS 1001 has fan redundancy protection mechanism against a single fan failure for up to 96 hours. The inlet temperature of system during replacement must be less than 40 deg Celsius at sea level. The replacement time decreases for higher altitudes.

Note
It is not recommended to remove two fans simultaneously. When the failed fan is replaced, the new fan needs to be physically placed within 5 minutes. Otherwise, the performance of the system is affected.

Press the lever of the fan and pull it to remove the fan out as shown.
Insert Control Card
Use this procedure to insert the control card.

The control card is properly seated.
6
The control card is not properly seated. Repeat the instructions mentioned in callout 2 to push the control card.
Procedure
Step 1
Insert the control card in the NCS 1001 box guides.
Step 2
Slide the control card while keeping the ejector open until the faceplate is close to the box and the ejector is engaged.
Step 3
Press the ejector to insert the control card partially.
Step 4
Apply pressure on the control card faceplate to complete the insertion.
Step 5
Ensure that the control card faceplate is aligned to the top cover edge of NCS 1001.
Step 6
Verify that the position of the ejector is final.
Step 7
Fix the screw to lock the ejector.
Step 8
Push the fan tray inside the chassis.
Step 9
Ensure that the captive screws are aligned properly and fasten the captive screws.
Step 10
Insert the fans inside the cage. See Insert Fans.
Remove Control Card

Note
The inlet temperature of system during replacement must be less than 40 deg Celsius at sea level. The replacement time decreases for higher altitudes.

Note
In case of card failure, the failed control card needs to be physically replaced within 2 minutes. Otherwise, the performance of the system is affected.

Procedure
Step 1
Remove the fans from slots 2 and 3. See Remove Fans.
Step 2
Unfasten the fan tray screws as shown.
Step 3
Pull out the fans from the chassis as shown.
Step 4
Use the ejector lever to eject the control card from the chassis.
Step 5
Use the control card handle to remove the control card completely.
Remove and Replace SSD

Note
If the SSD is removed, it needs to be physically replaced within 10 minutes. If NCS 1001 runs without the SSD, the SSD metallic cover must be placed to close the SSD slot.
To remove a SSD:
Procedure
Step 1
Loosen the two captive screws in the Removable Disk slot on the back side.
Step 2
Slide out the SSD from the Removable Disk slot.
Figure 8. Remove SSD


To replace a SSD:
Step 3
Slide the SSD into the Removable Disk slot.
Step 4
Tighten the two captive screws to secure the SSD into place.
Insert Optical Modules
Use this procedure to insert the optical modules.
Procedure
Step 1
Arrange the ejector lever of the optical module approximately at 60 degrees as shown.
Step 2
Push the module gently inside the slot (1, 2, or 3) with the ejector lever on top.
Step 3
Use the ejector lever force to push the module inside.
Step 4
When the ejector is aligned to the faceplate, fasten the captive screw in the clockwise direction to complete the assembly.

Remove Optical Modules
Use this procedure to remove the optical modules.
Procedure
Step 1
Unfasten the captive screws in anti-clockwise direction.
Step 2
Use the ejector lever to pull the module outside.
Step 3
Once the module is partially out, pull the module from the chassis.

Cable Routing
Figure 12. Cable Routing


Routing of ground cable: If there is a requirement to route ground cable separately from other electrical cables, it can be passed under the cable managed bracket and tied with bracket arm.
Routing of other cables: If there is a requirement of separate routing of fibre and copper cables, there are several 1 RU fibre management trays available which can be made use of during installation.
Wipe Data in Disk Using Secure Erase
When NCS 1001 becomes faulty, contact TAC to open a Return Material Authorization (RMA) request. Before opening a RMA request, the user can securely wipe data in NCS 1001 disks using the Secure Erase feature. The Secure Erase feature is supported from BIOS version v13.10.

Warning
Use this procedure only during RMA.
Before you begin
The NCS 1001 unit that is planned for RMA must be taken out of the data center and the network. The user must access NCS 1001 only using the console port.
Procedure
Step 1
When NCS 1001 boots (power cycle), the following message appears.
Version 2.17.1245. Copyright (C) 2016 American Megatrends, Inc.
BIOS Date: 03/22/2016 11:19:42 Ver: 0ACBZ1310
Press <DEL> or <ESC> to enter setup.
Press DEL or ESC key to enter BIOS.
Step 2
Select the Security tab using the arrow keys.
The disk security details such as setting Hard Disk Drive (HDD) password and erasing HDD are displayed in the Security tab.
Step 3
Select Set HDD Password to set the new HDD password.
The HDD password can contain only ASCII characters and is not case sensitive. The HDD password needs to be provided after power reset and the password can be set or changed after power reset. The disk security is enabled after setting the HDD password.
Warning 
When HDD password is set, the user must remember the password. If the password is lost, the data in HDD cannot be recovered.
Warning 
When HDD password is set, BIOS prompts for HDD password to unlock the HDD after each power reset.
Step 4
Select Erase HDD using the arrow keys.
The Erase HDD screen appears.
Step 5
Enter the HDD password in the Erase HDD field.
Step 6
Select OK in the Erase Confirmation screen that indicates the data in the disk has been securely wiped.
The disk security settings are reverted to factory defaults after the secure erase. The configured HDD password is also wiped.
