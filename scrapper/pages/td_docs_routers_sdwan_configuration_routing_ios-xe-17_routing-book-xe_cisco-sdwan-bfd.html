Automatically Suspend Unstable Cisco SD-WAN BFD Sessions
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10.1a
Cisco SD-WAN Controllers Release 20.10.1
With this feature, you can automatically suspend an unstable Cisco SD-WAN Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) session based on flap-cycle parameters or on Service-Level Agreement (SLA) parameters.
You can also monitor the suspended BFD sessions and manually reset suspended BFD sessions.

Information About Cisco SD-WAN BFD
Within Cisco SD-WAN, there are the following types of BFD:
Cisco SD-WAN BFD
This type of BFD detects failures in the overlay tunnel and has the following characteristics:
Is enabled by default and cannot be disabled
Is typically enabled for the Cisco SD-WAN Overlay Management Protocol (OMP)
Besides link failures, Cisco SD-WAN BFD also measures latency, loss, jitter, and other link statistics used by application-aware routing
For more information on Cisco SD-WAN BFD for measuring latency, loss, and jitter used by application-aware routing, see Application-Aware Routing.
BFD Support for Routing Protocols in Cisco SD-WAN
This type of BFD supports BGP, OSFP, and EIGRP routing protocols in Cisco SD-WAN.
For more information on BFD for routing protocols, see BFD for Routing Protocols in Cisco SD-WAN.
Information About Automatically Suspending BFD Sessions
Minimum supported releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10.1a and Cisco SD-WAN Controllers Release 20.10.1
BFD sessions may experience flapping, meaning that the BFD session enters a down state and then returns to an up state. This can occur when one device that is part of the BFD session becomes unavailable and then returns to being available. When a BFD session flaps, applications running on that tunnel are disrupted. The unstable BFD session can be brought up, but due to the unstable connection, the BFD session can quickly become disrupted again. With this feature, you avoid the impact of application traffic getting steered unnecessarily from one overlay path to another path because of an unstable BFD session.
To avoid the cycle of BFD session flaps, Cisco SD-WAN provides an automatic suspension mechanism for suspending BFD sessions based on the following parameters:
Flap cycle
A flap cycle is defined only as the following:
BFD session is in the up state
BFD session is in the down state
BFD session is coming back up
SLA threshold
An SLA threshold is the threshold by which the BFD session is added to the suspended list. An SLA threshold is a threshold value for a traffic metric, such as loss, latency, or jitter. If one of these metrics indicates that traffic performance has degraded to a point defined by a threshold, the BFD session state changes to suspended. These thresholds reflect the level of traffic performance specified in the SLA.

Note
An SLA threshold is an optional configuration. If you configure a SLA threshold, configure higher metrics for loss, latency, and jitter, so the SLA threshold does not conflict with the SLA parameters as defined in the SLA classes. For more information on SLA classes, see the Cisco SD-WAN Policies Configuration Guide.

Configure the following BFD session parameters using a Cisco vManage device CLI template or a CLI add-on template:
Table 2. BFD Session Flap Cycle and SLA Parameters
Field
Description
enable-lr
Enable last resort upon BFD suspension.
For more information on enabling a last resort on a tunnel interface, see last-resort-circuit.
duration
Duration of time for which the BFD session remains in the suspended state.
flapping-window
Time frame or window to detect the BFD session flap.
flap-count
Number of BFD session flaps after which the BFD session is suspended.
The recommended flap-count is 3.
thresholds
SLA threshold triggering a BFD session to be suspended.
BFD Session Suspension Workflow
If a BFD session exceeds the flap-count value within the configured flapping-window interval, then the BFD session must remain suspended until the configured duration interval.
For a BFD session in the suspended state, the following occurs:
If a session reflaps or exceeds the threshold parameters defined, the session is moved back to suspended state and the duration is reset again.
If the session does not flap and is within the threshold range, the session is automatically removed out of the suspended state after the duration interval expires.
You can also manually remove suspended BFD sessions by using the request platform software sdwan auto-suspend reset command. For more information, see the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Qualified Command Reference Guide.
Regular SLA measurement and echo response or path maximum transmission unit (PMTU) control traffic only is sent across the suspended BFD session.

Note
Data traffic is not sent across the overlay network when a BFD session is in the suspended state.

Note
This feature does not manipulate the state of the BFD session.

Note
As the BFD suspension feature is for forward data traffic, you should enable BFD suspension on the remote-end node to block the reverse data traffic to avoid dropping data traffic.
Restrictions for Automatically Suspending BFD Sessions
Minimum supported releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10.1a and Cisco SD-WAN Controllers Release 20.10.1
For a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device with a single TLOC, automatic suspension of a BFD session may cause BFD sessions to be dropped.
The last-resort circuit may not work for a single site unless all BFD sessions are down for a tunnel interface. The last-resort circuit is enabled only if all BFD sessions on the non last-resort circuit are suspended or down.
Cisco vManage feature templates do not support configuration of automatic suspension of BFD sessions.
Support is provided only for configuring BFD automatic suspension using a device CLI or a CLI add-on template.
If duplicated traffic is sent on a different BFD session, the duplicated traffic may get routed through a BFD suspended session.
Configure Automatic Suspension of BFD Sessions Using a CLI Template
Minimum supported releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10.1a and Cisco SD-WAN Controllers Release 20.10.1
For more information about using CLI templates, see CLI Add-On Feature Templates and CLI Templates.

Note
By default, CLI templates execute commands in global config mode.
Enable BFD automatic suspension with or without last resort.
auto-suspend
    enable-lr
auto-suspend
    no enable-lr

Note
Before enabling last resort for the BFD automatic suspension feature, you must enable the last-resort circuit on a tunnel interface.
For more information on last resort, see last-resort-circuit.
Configure the following flap parameters:
duration sec
    flapping-window sec
    flap-count flap-count

Note
When using SLA-based BFD automatic suspension, duration should be more than the number of the bfd multiplier x the bfd poll interval . We recommend that you configure BFD automatic suspension duration to be more than 30 minutes.
(Optional) Configure SLA parameters.

The following columns are added for BFD suspension: BFD-LD and FLAGS.
Local discriminator (LD) is a unique identifier for all BFD sessions. The value for LD must be a nonzero value. LD is an internal value that Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) uses for troubleshooting BFD sessions.
A BFD session flag, Sus, is added for identifying BFD sessions that are suspended.
The following sample output displays the BFD sessions for which the Sus flag is added to the BFD session:
