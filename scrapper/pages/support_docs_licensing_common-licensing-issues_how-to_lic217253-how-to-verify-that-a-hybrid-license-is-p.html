Sales order
Verifying That a Hybrid License Is Part of the Sales Order in CSSM
Step 1: 
Go to Cisco Software Central and log in with your Cisco.com account.
Step 2:
In theSmart Software Managersection, clickManage licenses.
Step 3:
In Smart Software Licensing, on the Convert to Smart Licensing tab, click Convert PAKs, and then enter the sales order in the search bar. Press Enter or click the magnifying glass icon.
Step result: If the system displays results, it is a verification that the product activation key (PAK) associated with this specific sales order contains a Hybrid license that you can then convert to a Smart license. If the system displays no results, then a product activation key (PAK) containing a Hybrid license is not part of the sales order.
Note: To convert a Hybrid to Smart license, refer to the How to Convert a Hybrid to Smart License in CSSM article.
Step 4:
To view detailed information about the product activation key (PAK) that contains a Hybrid license, click the product activation key (PAK) hyperlink in the PAK column.
Step result: The system displays a dialog box with detailed information about the product activation key (PAK) and the licenses that it contains.
Troubleshooting
If you experience any issue during the verification process, open a case in Support Case Manager (SCM).
