Chapter: Perform System Upgrade and Install Feature Packages
Chapter Contents
The system upgrade and package installation processes are executed using install commands on the NCS 1001. The processes involve adding and activating the iso images (.iso), feature packages (.rpm), and software maintenance upgrade files (.smu) on the NCS 1001. These files are accessed from a network server and then activated on the NCS 1001. If the installed package or SMU causes any issue, it can be uninstalled.
The topics covered in this chapter are:

Install Packages
Upgrade the System
Upgrading the system is the process of installing a new version of the Cisco IOS XR operating system on the NCS 1001. The NCS 1001 comes pre-installed with the Cisco IOS XR image. However, you can install the new version in order to keep features up to date. The system upgrade operation is performed from the XR mode. However, during system upgrade, the operating systems that run both on the XR and the System Admin get upgraded.
System upgrade is done by installing a base package–Cisco IOS XR Core Bundle plus Manageability Package. The file name for this bundle is ncs1001-mini-x-7.9.1.iso. Install this ISO image using install commands. For more information about the install process, see Workflow for Install Process.

Upgrade the Firmware
Use the following procedure to upgrade the firmware.

Attention
If you are upgrading FPDs from R7.8.1 to later releases, refer to Upgrade FPDs for serialized upgrade.

Note
The output of this procedure is related to R7.7.1. The FPDs to be installed for later releases are different. Refer to Software Compatibility Matrix for FPD versions.

Note
The BIOS and Daisy Duke FPD upgrade from R6.3.x and R6.5.x to R7.1.1, R7.1.2, R7.3.1, R7.3.2, R7.5.1, R7.5.2, R7.7.1, R7.8.1, or R7.9.1 must be executed with proper steps. We recommend that you read through the entire procedure before performing any upgrade steps.
Procedure
Perform the procedures in the following sequence.
Upgrade BIOS and Daisy Duke FPDs
Upgrade Control FPGA and Control BKP FPDs
Upgrade PSM
Upgrade EDFA
Upgrade BIOS and Daisy Duke FPDs
Upgrade Control FPGA and Control BKP FPDs
Upgrade PSM
Upgrade EDFA
Upgrade FPDs
Upgrade BIOS and Daisy Duke FPDs

Attention
This procedure is valid only until Release 7.7.1.
From R7.0.1 and later, the upgrade procedure also updates the secure boot keys.

Caution
Ensure that secure boot keys are updated prior to other FPD upgrades. If BIOS and Daisy Duke FPGA FPDs are upgraded without updating the secure boot keys, it can lead to RMA of the device.

Note
BIOS downgrade is not supported once BIOS FPD is upgraded to 15.10.
The 15.10 BIOS FPD version does not have issues for software images prior to R7.2.1. If the user needs to downgrade the software image prior to R7.2.1, the BIOS FPDs always show the status as "NEED UPGRADE".
Before you begin
For software upgrades from any release to R7.0.1 and later, disable auto-fpd upgrade using the fpd auto-upgrade disable command.
Install SMUs for R6.3.2, R6.5.2, or R7.0.0 software to upgrade the FPDs with secure boot keys and then upgrade the software to R7.0.1 and later.

Step 2
Enter the show controllers ots 0/2/0/* summary command to check the port status.
If the output shows Ots0_2_0_2 Protected Active, switch the PSM state to Ots0_2_0_1 Working Active and Ots0_2_0_2 Protected Standby.
Step 3

Step 4
Enter the no hw-module location 0/RP0/CPU0 slot 2 psm lockout-from WORKING to move the PSM state to Ots0_2_0_1 Working Active without any lockout in place.
Step 5
commit
Step 6
Enter the hw-module slot 2 manual-switch-to WORKING command from IOS XR console to switch the traffic manually from the protect to the working path.
PSM switch causes traffic loss for less than 50 ms.
Step 7
Enter the show controllers ots 0/2/0/* summary command to check the output.
If the switch to the Working port is successful, Ots0_2_0_1 Working port is reported as Active. If the switch to the Working port is successful, check whether the far-end node is also active on the same port.
Step 8
Enter the show controllers ots 0/2/0/* summary command on the far-end node to verify that Ots0_2_0_1 Working port is reported as Active.
Note 
If the status of PSM Working port is still Standby, it indicates that the previous switch command was not successful.
Failure to switch to the Working path indicates that the Working path is alarmed, or a lockout-from working is intentionally set in the configuration. In both the cases, further troubleshooting of the overall Working path (near-end node to far-end node) is required to resolve outstanding problems.
When both the near-end and far-end nodes are Active on the Working port, proceed with the following upgrade steps.
Step 9
Enter the upgrade hw module location 0/2 fpd FW_PSMv1 command from IOS XR console to upgrade the PSMv1 FPD.
If the FPD type is FW_PSMv2, the above command changes to upgrade hw module location 0/1 fpd FW_PSMv2.
If the configuration includes path protection topology, FW_ PSMv1 upgrade is traffic-affecting and can be done using the force option as follows:
Enter the upgrade hw module location 0/2 fpd FW_PSMv1 force command from IOS XR console to upgrade the PSMv1 FPD.
Step 10
Enter the show hw-module fpd command from the admin console to view the status of PSM FPD.
Example:
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios# show hw-module fpd

Attention
This procedure is valid only until Release 7.7.1.
To upgrade each EDFA module present in NCS 1001, you must identify the correct location, based on the specific FPD device.
Procedure
Step 1
Enter the upgrade hw module location 0/1 fpd FW_EDFAv1 force command from IOS XR console to upgrade the EDFA FPD.
If the FPD type is FW_EDFAv2, the above command changes to upgrade hw module location 0/1 fpd FW_EDFAv2 force.
Step 2

Description
FPD Upgrade Enhancement
Cisco IOS XR Release 7.8.1
FPD upgrade is made easy with a new command upgrade hw-module location all fpd all. It performs the end-to-end upgrade of all FPD modules with a single execution. As a result, the need to make progressive upgrades is eliminated.
From Release 7.8.1, the upgrade of the NCS 1001 FPD devices is serialized and requires no manual intervention. The command works only when the FPD devices are in NEED UPGD status.
You can also use the upgrade hw-module location all fpd all force command to force the upgrade of the FPD devices. This command upgrades all the components forcefully even if the FPDs are in the current version.

Note
The upgrade hw-module location all fpd all force command on FW_PSMv1 from 1.43 to higher version is traffic-affecting.
The FPD devices upgrade in the following sequence:
Control_BKP
Control_FPGA

Note
After upgrade of Control_BKP and Control_FPGA FPDs, the NCS 1001 controller cards reload automatically.
FPDs of NCS 1001 cards in slots 1, 2, and 3
BIOS_Backup
BIOS_Primary
Daisy_Duke_BKP
Daisy_Duke_FPGA

Install Packages
Packages and software patches (SMU) can be installed on NCS 1001. Installing a package on NCS 1001 installs specific features that are part of that package. Cisco IOS XR software is divided into various software packages; this enables you to select the features to run on NCS 1001. Each package contains components that perform a specific set of NCS 1001 functions.
The naming convention of the package is <platform>-<pkg>-<pkg version>-<release version>.<architecture>.rpm. Standard packages are:
Feature Set

Workflow for Install Process
To install a package, see Install Packages. To uninstall a package, see Uninstall Packages. The workflow for installation and uninstallation processes are depicted in individual flowcharts in their respective subsections.
Install Packages
Complete this task to upgrade the system or install a patch. The system upgrade is done using an ISO image file, while the patch installation is done using packages and SMUs. This task is also used to install .tar files. The .tar file contains multiple packages and SMUs that are merged into a single file. A single .tar file can contain up to 64 individual files. The packaging format defines one RPM per component, without dependency on the card type.

Note
To install a System Admin package or a XR package, execute the install commands in System Admin EXEC mode or XR EXEC mode respectively. All install commands are applicable in both these modes.
The workflow for installing a package is shown in this flowchart.
Figure 1. Installing Packages Workflow



Note
Disable auto-fpd upgrade before start of software upgrade.
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#configure
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios(config)#fpd auto-upgrade disable
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios(config)#commit
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios(config)#end
Before you begin
Configure and connect to the management port. The installable file is accessed through the management port. For details about configuring the management port, see Configure Management Interface.
Copy the package to be installed either on the NCS 1001 hard disk or on a network server to which the NCS 1001 has access.

The package configurations are made active on the NCS 1001. As a result, new features and software fixes take effect. This operation is performed in asynchronous mode. The install activate command runs in the background, and the EXEC prompt is returned.
Note 
After an RPM of a higher version is activated, and if it is required to activate an RPM of a lower version, use the force option. For example:
Using the traditional method, add the RPM with lower version to the repository and then force the activation:
install add source repository ncs1001-k9sec-1.0.0.0-r791.x86_64.rpm
install activate ncs1001-k9sec-1.0.0.0-r791.x86_64.rpm force
or
Using the install update command:
install update source repository ncs1001-k9sec-1.0.0.0-r791.x86_64.rpm
If you use the operation ID, all packages that were added in the specified operation are activated together. For example, if 5 packages are added in operation 2, all the 5 packages are activated together. You do not have to activate the packages individually.
Step 6
Execute this command in a new CLI session after reboot of RP0.
Example:
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#show install active
Thu Jul 25 17:04:47.600 CEST
Node 0/RP0/CPU0 [RP]
  Boot Partition: xr_lv48
  Active Packages: 2
        ncs1001-xr-7.9.1 version=7.9.1 [Boot image]
        ncs1001-k9sec-1.0.0.0-r791.x86_64.rpm
Displays packages that are active.
Step 7
install commit show install active system
Example:
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#install commit system
Thu Jul 25 17:05:27.364 CEST
Jul 25 17:05:30 Install operation 15 started by root:
  install commit system 
Jul 25 17:05:31 Install operation will continue in the background

Jul 25 17:05:55 Install operation 15 finished successfully
Commits the newly active software.
Note 
If you perform a manual or automatic system reload without completing the transaction with the install commit command during system upgrade, the action will revert the system to the point before the install transaction commenced, including any configuration changes. Only the log is preserved for debugging. This action clears all configuration rollback points available. You will not be able to rollback to, or view, any commits made until the install rollback event. Any new commits made after the install rollback event will start from commit ID ‘1000000001’.
Step 8
show install commit
Example:
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#show install commit
Thu Jul 25 17:07:54.255 CEST
Node 0/RP0/CPU0 [RP]
  Boot Partition: xr_lv48
  Committed Packages: 2
        ncs1001-xr-7.9.1 version=7.9.1[Boot image]
        ncs1001-k9sec-1.0.0.0-r791.x86_64.rpm
Installing Packages: Related Commands
Related Commands Purpose
show install log
Displays the log information for the install process; this can be used for troubleshooting in case of installation failure.
show install package
Displays the details of the packages that have been added to the repository. Use this command to identify individual components of a package.
install prepare
Makes pre-activation checks on an inactive package, to prepare it for activation.
show install prepare
Displays the list of package that have been prepared and are ready for activation.
What to do next
After performing a system upgrade, upgrade FPD by using the upgrade hw-module location all fpd all command from the Cisco IOS XR mode. The progress of FPD upgrade process can be monitored using the show hw-module fpd command.
Reload NCS 1001 if any FPD status is in RLOAD REQ state. If CTRL FPGA is in RLOAD REQ state, use the hw-module location 0/0 reload command. If Daisy Duke or BIOS is in RLOAD REQ state, use the hw-module location 0/RP0 reload command.
Verify the installation using the install verify packages command.
Uninstall the packages or SMUs if their installation causes any issues on the NCS 1001. See Uninstall Packages.

Note
ISO images cannot be uninstalled. However, you can perform a system downgrade by installing an older ISO version.
(Optional) Install Prepared Packages
A system upgrade or feature upgrade is performed by activating the ISO image file, packages, and SMUs. It is possible to prepare these installable files before activation. During the prepare phase, pre-activation checks are made and the components of the installable files are loaded on to the NCS 1001 setup. The prepare process runs in the background and the NCS 1001 is fully usable during this time. When the prepare phase is over, the prepared files can be activated instantaneously. The advantages of preparing before activation are:
If the installable file is corrupted, the prepare process fails. This provides an early warning of the problem. If the corrupted file was activated directly, it may cause the NCS 1001 to malfunction.
Directly activating an ISO image for system upgrade takes considerable time during which the NCS 1001 is not usable. However, if the image is prepared before activation, not only does the prepare process run asynchronously, but when the prepared image is subsequently activated, the activation process too takes less time. As a result, the downtime is considerably reduced.
Complete this task to upgrade the system and install packages by making use of the prepare operation.
Procedure
Step 1
Add the required ISO image and packages to the repository.
For details, see Install Packages.
Step 2
show install repository
Example:
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios# show install repository
Thu Jul 25 14:49:56.892 CEST

    ncs1001-k9sec-1.0.0.0-r791.x86_64.rpm
    ncs1001-mini-x-7.9.1.iso
    . . . . .
Perform this step to verify that the required installable files are available in the repository. Packages are displayed only after the "install add" operation is complete.
Step 3
Execute one of these commands:
install prepare package_name
install prepare id operation_id
Example:
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#install prepare ncs1001-mini-x-7.9.1.iso ncs1001-k9sec-1.0.0.0-r791.x86_64.rpm
or
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#install prepare id 5
Fri Jul 26 11:36:41.163 CEST
Jul 26 11:36:45 Install operation 5 started by root:

Could not start this install operation. Install operation 5 is still in progress
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:152#Jul 26 11:48:57 Install operation 5 finished successfully
The prepare process takes place. This operation is performed in asynchronous mode. The install prepare command runs in the background, and the EXEC prompt is returned.
Install prepare is the first step of the activation process and can also be executed before the activation process.
If you use the operation ID, all packages that were added in the specified operation are prepared together. For example, if 5 packages are added in operation 5, by executing the install prepare id 5 command, all 5 packages are prepared together. You do not have to prepare the packages individually.
Step 4
show install prepare
Example:
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#show install prepare
Displays packages that are prepared. From the result, verify that all required packages have been prepared.
