Network Convergence System 1000 Series
NCS 1010
NCS 1010 OLS platform is an integral component of the Routed Optical Networking solution. It provides point-to-point and mesh connectivity between routers with ZR/ZR+ optics and multiplexes signals from multiple routers over a single fiber. The OLS platform supports ROADM nodes of up to 8 degrees using the NCS 1000 Breakout Patch Panel. NCS 1010 supports both C-band and L-band WDM transmission through three variants of Optical Line Terminal (OLT), such as OLT-C, OLT-R-C, and OLT-L, and four variants of In-Line Amplifier (ILA), such as ILA-C, ILA-L, ILA-R-C, ILA-2R-C.
The NCS 1010 OLS platform comprises of:
Network Convergence System (NCS 1010) chassis—A 3RU modular chassis that has an in-built External Interface Timing Unit (EITU) and multiple field-replaceable modules.
Cisco NCS 1000 Breakout Patch Panel—A colorless breakout patch panel that enables you to implement long-haul topologies. By using three NCS1K-BRK-24 modules, up to 72 Mux/Demux channels can be supported, and by using one NCS1K-BRK-8 module, up to eight ROADM degrees can be supported.
Cisco NCS 1000 32-Channel Mux/Demux Patch Panels—Support colored channels that enable you to implement metro topologies, and the Routed Optical Networking solution. Each of the two Mux/Demux patch panels (NCS1K-MD-32O-C and NCS1K-MD32E-C) supports 32 channels and works as an add/drop unit for the OLT-C and OLT-R-C line cards.
NCS 1004
The Cisco NCS 1004 chassis is a 2 RU chassis that delivers a universal transponder solution which provides excellent performance for metro, long-haul and submarine applications. The following is the list of cards supported by NCS 1004 and the corresponding PIDs:
1.2T C-Band line card (1.2 Tbps) - NCS1K4-1.2T-K9

What's New in Cisco NCS 1000 Series, IOS XR Release 7.9.1
NCS 1010
Feature Description
Datapath Configuration
ASE Loading Enhancements
In addition to the C-band, ASE (Amplified Spontaneous Emission) loading on OLT cards is now enabled for L-band. ASE loading makes the system intrinsically stable and tolerant to power transients by populating the transmission spectrum with noise. It is done to keep the fiber activated even when provisioned optical channels are unavailable during system startup, channel failures, and channel deletion.
Also, you can now create overlapping channels (Nyquist channels) on the OLT cards. As a result, fiber utilization is considerably improved as more channels are accommodated within a single fiber. During the failure of overlapping channels, ASE loading fills the void with an overlapping ASE spectrum.
NCS 1010 L-Band and C+L-Band Support.
NCS 1010 now supports C+L-Band. The addition of the L-Band to the existing C-Band provides more channels increasing the data transfer capacity of the optical line system.
OLT Based Omnidirectional Add/Drop Topology
You can now set up pure OLT-based omnidirectional add/drop topology. This topology is supported over the C+L band and scalable beyond 4-degree nodes. Dual omnidirectional add/drop can be implemented on a node to provide redundancy or increased add/drop capacity.
The omnidirectional setup provides the flexibility to the multidegree topology to route channels through any of the optical degrees during fiber cut without the need for physical fiber reconnections.
SNMP MIB support is enabled in NCS 1010
The standard optical Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Management Information Bases (MIBs) with Object Identifiers (OIDs) are now supported on the NCS 1010 platform. Also, from R7.9.1 Release onwards specific support is enabled for the OTS SNMP MIB. See Cisco SNMP MIBs for details.
Optical Applications Configuration
APC enhancements
APC (Automatic Power Control) on NCS 1010 now supports C+L band networks in addition to C band only networks. Also, APC is enhanced to perform power correction even when it does not have end-to-end network visibility. This ensures that the operational section of the network always has power at the target Power Spectral Density (PSD) profile, and when the network comes up, the traffic restoration is faster.
Band Failure Recovery (BFR)
During the C+L band network bring up, as both the bands travel through the same fiber, optical power is transferred from higher frequency to lower frequency due to SRS (Stimulated Raman Scattering). This degrades the C-band channel power and causes the existing C-band power profile to change.
BFR compensates for this dynamic power change by adjusting the power profile that minimizes the impact when upgrading from C-band to the C+L band network. BFR also adjusts power during a band failure to minimize the impact on the surviving band.
Hardware
NCS1K-ILA-L Line Card
The new NCS1K-ILA-L line card for the NCS 1010 optical line system amplifies L-band traffic. The ILA-L card acts as expansion equipment for the ILA-C units and connects to the L-band expansion port in the ILA-C unit. The ILA-L enables sending the low-loss L-Band through the existing ILA-C node to enhance the fiber capacity and effectively upgrade the C-band only node to a C+L band node.
NCS1K-OLT-L Line Card
The new NCS1K-OLT-L line card for the NCS 1010 optical line system performs the add/drop function for the L-band traffic. The OLT-L card acts as expansion equipment for the OLT-C units and connects to the L-band expansion port in the OLT-C unit. By supporting L-band traffic, the OLT-L line card improves fiber utilization by enabling the existing OLT-C node to send both C-band and L-band traffic.
Port Status for Breakout Modules
The LEDs for optical ports (COM, TX-i-RX) in the breakout modules will now indicate port status in these colors:
Red—Presence of major and critical alarms that could be traffic-impacting.
Amber—Presence of minor alarm when tone generation or tone detection is initiated. Tone detection uses a specific probe signal to verify the connection between OLT line cards and the breakout modules.
Green—Normal operations with no system alarms.
Port Status for Mux/Demux Patch Panel
In the mux/demux panel, the optical ports (COM, CH-0…CH-31) LEDs will now indicate port status in the following three colors:
Red—Presence of traffic-impacting major and critical alarms.
Amber—Presence of minor alarm when performing tone generation or tone detection for connection verification. Tone detection verifies the connection between OLT line cards and the mux/demux panels using a specific probe signal.
Green—Patch panel is operating fine and no alarm is raised.
Telemetry
Sensor Paths Supported for EDT
New native YANG model sensor paths and an OpenConfig sensor path are introduced for Event Driven Telemetry (EDT) in NCS 1010.
EDT streams data only when a state transition occurs and thus avoids excess data collection at the receiver.
EDT streams data about interface state transitions, controller shutdown, and failure, removal and insertion of the components such as power module, fan, line card, and passive modules into the NCS 1010 chassis.
Sensor Paths Supported for MDT
Model Driven Telemetry (MDT) is now supported by NCS 1010 for the native YANG models and OpenConfig sensor paths. MDT performs continuous data streaming and provides near real-time access to operational statistics.
NCS 1004
Feature Description
System Setup and Software Installation
Automatic FPD Upgrade
The automatic FPD upgrade functionality is now enabled by default. It upgrades the FPD components' firmware version to the latest version. This enhancement eliminates the need to explicitly enable the functionality using the fpd auto-upgrade enable command. As a result, the software upgrade is simplified, and the system always maintains the latest state of the FPD firmware version.
Configuration
APS Support for 100G and 200G Trunk Bandwidth on OTN XP Cards
In addition to the 400G client and trunk bandwidth, you can now configure Automatic Protection Switching (APS) for the following trunk and client bandwidth combinations:
200G DWDM and 2x100G clients
100G QSFP28 Grey with 10x10G clients
Encryption for 10G clients and 100GE clients on OTN-XP Card
OTN-XP card now supports AES 256-GCM authenticated OTNSec encryption for 10G and 100GE clients in the 40x10G-4x100G-MXP mode. As this authentication method uses a key size of 256 bits, it provides considerably strong cryptography acceptable by enterprise, and public sector organizations.
Smart Licensing Support on 2-QDD-C Card
Smart licensing is now supported on the 2-QDD-C card. Being a cloud-based software license management solution, it enables you to automate the licensing process and provides some of these functionalities:
Asset management information to plan and track the licenses.
License pooling across the organization, enabling them to be reused across organizational boundaries.
Notifies to buy out-of-compliance licenses when the license limit exceeds the paid license limit.
NCS 1001
Feature Description
Data Models
New Optics Telemetry Bag
The telemetry bag, which maintains the collection of telemetry data, needs to be of an ideal size to stream the data effectively. In this release, the optical telemetry bag size has been optimized by introducing the following exclusive sensor paths for OTS and OTS-OCH controllers:
Cisco-IOS-XR-controller-ncs1001-ots-och-oper:ots-och-oper/ots-och-ports/ots-och-port/ots-och-info
Cisco-IOS-XR-controller-ncs1001-ots-oper:ots-oper/ots-ports/ots-port/ots-info
Unlike in previous release, where OTS and OTS-OCH controller's telemetry data was accessed from a single telemetry bag, it is now separated out by the respective sensor paths. The already existing optics-info sensor path now includes only the data of the OPTICS controller. The result is a smaller bag size. Two new native NETCONF yang models are introduced to support the two new sensor paths.
YANG Data Models Introduced and Enhanced
We have launched the Yang Explorer tool as an easy reference to view the Data Models (Native, Unified, OpenConfig) supported in IOS XR platforms and releases. You can explore the data model definitions, locate a specific model, and view the containers and their respective lists, leaves, leaf lists, Xpaths, and much more.
As we continue to enhance the tool, we would love to hear your feedback. You are welcome to drop us a note here.
