  Cisco RMA Policy for Warranty and Hardware Support Contract Returns
Cisco Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries will issue Return Materials Authorization (RMA) numbers to customers to track authorized returns. Any materials returned to Cisco without an authorized RMA will be returned to customer or destroyed at Cisco’s option.
Customers must return defective product in accordance with the terms of the product warranty or hardware support contract, as applicable.
If the relevant warranty or support documentation does not provide specific instructions for RMA returns, the terms of this policy apply.
RMA Policy:
Customer must return defective parts in accordance with Cisco’s return materials authorization (RMA) procedure located at www.cisco.com within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the replacement parts. If Customer has not returned the defective parts (which must conform in quantity and serial number to the RMA request) within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the replacement parts, Cisco may:
●   charge Customer for the full list price (not discounted) of the parts not returned; and
●   reduce or deny Services until the parts are returned or payment for non-return is made.
This policy also applies to returns facilitated by Cisco authorized resellers.
