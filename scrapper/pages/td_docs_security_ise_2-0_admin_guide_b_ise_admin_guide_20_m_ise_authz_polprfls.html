Cisco ISE Authorization Policies
Authorization policies are a component of the Cisco ISE network authorization service. This service allows you to define authorization policies and configure authorization profiles for specific users and groups that access your network resources.
Authorization policies can contain conditional requirements that combine one or more identity groups using a compound condition that includes authorization checks that can return one or more authorization profiles. In addition, conditional requirements can exist apart from the use of a specific identity group (such as in using the default “Any”).
Authorization policies are used when creating authorization profiles in Cisco Identity Services Engine (Cisco ISE). An authorization policy is composed of authorization rules. Authorization rules have three elements: name, attributes, and permissions. The permission element is that maps to an authorization profile.
Cisco ISE Authorization Profiles
Authorization policies associate rules with specific user and group identities to create the corresponding profiles. Whenever these rules match the configured attributes, the corresponding authorization profile that grants permission is returned by the policy and network access is authorized accordingly.
For example, authorization profiles can include a range of permissions that are contained in the following types:
Standard profiles
Exception profiles
Device-based profiles
Profiles consist of attributes chosen from a set of resources, which are stored in any of the available vendor dictionaries, and these are returned when the compound condition for the specific authorization policy matches. Because authorization policies can include compound condition mapping to a single network service rule, these can also include a list of authorization checks.
For simple scenarios, all authorization checks are made using the AND Boolean operator within the rule. For advanced scenarios, any type of authorization verification expression can be used, but all these authorization verifications must comply with the authorization profiles to be returned. Authorization verifications typically comprise one or more conditions, including a user-defined name that can be added to a library, which can then be reused by other authorization policies.

Authorization Policy Terminology
You can define authorization profiles and policies for network authorization of users to access Cisco ISE network and its resources. Cisco ISE also uses downloadable ACLs (DACLs), which are configured and implemented through authorization profiles. For more information about authorization profiles, see Authorization Profile. For more information about DACLs, see Downloadable ACLs.

Network Authorization
Network authorization controls user access to the network and its resources and what each user can do on the system with those resources . Activate network authorization from Cisco ISE by defining sets of permissions that authorize read, write, and execute privileges. Cisco ISE lets you create a number of different authorization policies to suit your network needs. This release supports only RADIUS access to the Cisco ISE network and its resources.
Policy Elements
Policy elements are components that define an authorization policy and are as follows:
Rule name
Identity groups
Conditions
Permissions
These policy elements are referenced when you create policy rules and your choice of conditions and attributes can create specific types of authorization profiles.
Authorization Profile
An authorization profile acts as a container where a number of specific permissions allow access to a set of network services. The authorization profile is where you define a set of permissions to be granted for a network access request and can include:
A profile name
A profile description
An associated ACL (Filter-ID)
An associated DACL
An associated VLAN
An associated SGACL
Any number of other dictionary-based attributes
Authorization Policy
An authorization policy can consist of a single rule or a set of rules that are user-defined. These rules act to create a specific policy. For example, a standard policy can include the rule name using an If-Then convention that links a value entered for identity groups with specific conditions or attributes to produce a specific set of permissions that create a unique authorization profile. There are two authorization policy options you can set:
First Matched Rules Apply
Multiple Matched Rule Applies
These two options direct Cisco ISE to use either the first matched or the multiple matched rule type listed in the standard policy table when it matches the user’s set of permissions. These are the two types of authorization policies that you can configure:
Standard—Standard policies are policies created to remain in effect for long periods of time, to apply to a larger group of users, devices, or groups, and to allow access to specific or all network endpoints. Standard policies are intended to be stable and apply to a large groups of users, devices, and groups that share a common set of privileges.
Standard policies can be used as templates that you modify to serve the needs of a specific identity group, using specific conditions or permissions, to create another type of standard policy to meet the needs of new divisions, or user groups, devices, or network groups.
Exception—By contrast, exception policies are appropriately named because this type of policy acts as an exception to the standard policies. Exception polices are intended for authorizing limited access that is based on a variety of factors, such as short-term policy duration, specific types of network devices, network endpoints or groups, or the need to meet special conditions or permissions or an immediate requirement.
Exception policies are created to meet an immediate or short-term need, such as authorizing a limited number of users, devices, or groups to access network resources. An exception policy lets you create a specific set of customized values for an identity group, condition, or permission that are tailored for one user or a subset of users. This allows you to create different or customized policies to meet your corporate, group, or network needs.
Access Control Lists
An access control list (ACL) in the Cisco ISE system is a list of permissions attached to a specific object or network resource. An ACL specifies which users or groups are granted access to an object, as well as what operations are allowed on a given object or network resource. Each entry in a typical ACL specifies a subject and an operation or provides the state (such as, Permit or Deny).
Authorization Policies and Supported Dictionaries
For authorization policy types, the verification must comply with the authorization profiles to be returned.
Verifications typically include one or more conditions that include a user-defined name that can then be added to a library and reused by other policies. You define conditions using the attributes from the Cisco ISE dictionary, which supports the following dictionaries:
System-defined dictionary:
RADIUS
RADIUS-vendor dictionaries
Airespace
Cisco
Cisco-BBSM
Cisco-VPN3000
Microsoft

Dictionaries and Dictionary Attributes
Guidelines for Configuring Authorization Policies and Profiles
Observe the following guidelines when managing or administering authorization polices and profiles:
Rule names you create must use only the following supported characters:
Symbols: plus (+), hyphen (-), underscore (_), period (.), and a space ( ).
Alphabetic characters: A-Z and a-z.
Numeric characters: 0-9.
Identity groups default to “Any” (you can use this global default to apply to all users).
Conditions allow you to set one or more policy values. However, conditions are optional and are not required to create an authorization policy. These are the two methods for creating conditions:
Choose an existing condition or attribute from a corresponding dictionary of choices.
Create a custom condition that allows you to select a suggested value or use a text box to enter a custom value.
Condition names you create must use only the following supported characters:
Symbols: hyphen (-), underscore (_), and period (.).
Alphabetic characters: A-Z and a-z.
Numeric characters: 0-9.
Permissions are important when choosing an authorization profile to use for a policy. A permission can grant access to specific resources or allow you to perform specific tasks. For example, if a user belongs to a specific identity group (such as Device Admins), and the user meets the defined conditions (such as a site in Boston), then this user is granted the permissions associated with that group (such as access to a specific set of network resources or permission to perform a specific operation on a device).
When you use the radius attribute Tunnel-Private-Group-ID in an authorization condition, you must mention both the tag and the value in the condition when the EQUALS operator is being used, for example:
Tunnel-Private-Group-ID EQUALS (tag=0) 77
Make sure that you click Save to save the new or modified policy or profile in the Cisco ISE database.

Configure Authorization Policies
The Authorization Policy page lets you display, create, duplicate, modify, or delete authorization policies. The following authorization policy profile sections reference example actions directed at a standard authorization policy. You can follow the same process for managing an exception authorization policy.
Before you begin
Before you begin this procedure, you should have a basic understanding of simple and rule-based conditions, the basic building blocks of identity groups, conditions, and permissions, and how they are used in the Admin portal.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Policy > Authorization > Standard.
Step 2
Click the down arrow on the far-right and select either Insert New Rule Above or Insert New Rule Below.
Step 3
Enter the rule name and select identity group, condition, attribute and permission for the authorization policy.
Not all attributes you select will include the “Equals,” “Not Equals,” “Matches,” “Starts With,” or “Not Starts With” operator options.
The “Matches” operator supports and uses regular expressions (REGEX) not wildcards.
Note 
You must use the “equals” operator for straight forward comparison. “Contains” operator can be used for multi-value attributes. “Matches” operator should be used for regular expression comparison. When “Matches” operator is used, regular expression will be interpreted for both static and dynamic values.
Step 4
Click Done.
Step 5
Click Save to save your changes to the Cisco ISE system database and create this new authorization policy.

Authorization Policy Attributes and Conditions
To reuse a valid attribute when creating authorization policy conditions, select it from a dictionary that contains the supported attributes. For example, Cisco ISE provides an attribute named AuthenticationIdentityStore, which is located in the NetworkAccess dictionary. This attribute identifies the last identity source that was accessed during the authentication of a user:
When a single identity source is used during authentication, this attribute includes the name of the identity store in which the authentication succeeded.
When an identity source sequence is used during authentication, this attribute includes the name of the last identity source accessed.
You can use the AuthenticationStatus attribute in combination with the AuthenticationIdentityStore attribute to define a condition that identifies the identity source to which a user has successfully been authenticated. For example, to check for a condition where a user authenticated using an LDAP directory (LDAP13) in the authorization policy, you can define the following reusable condition:
If NetworkAccess.AuthenticationStatus EQUALS AuthenticationPassed AND NetworkAccess.AuthenticationIdentityStore EQUALS LDAP13

Note
The AuthenticationIdentityStore represents a text field that allows you to enter data for the condition. Ensure that you enter or copy the name correctly into this field. If the name of the identity source changes, you must ensure to modify this condition to match the change to the identity source.
To define authorization conditions that are based on an endpoint identity group that has been previously authenticated, Cisco ISE supports authorization that was defined during endpoint identity group 802.1X authentication status. When Cisco ISE performs 802.1X authentication, it extracts the MAC address from the “Calling-Station-ID” field in the RADIUS request and uses this value to look up and populate the session cache for the device's endpoint identity group (defined as an endpointIDgroup attribute).
This process makes the endpointIDgroup attribute available for use in creating authorization policy conditions, and allows you to define an authorization policy based on endpoint identity group information using this attribute, in addition to user information.
The condition for the endpoint identity group can be defined in the ID Groups column of the authorization policy configuration page. Conditions that are based on user-related information need to be defined in the “Other Conditions” section of the authorization policy. If user information is based on internal user attributes, then use the ID Group attribute in the internal user dictionary. For example, you can enter the full value path in the identity group using a value like “User Identity Group:Employee:US”.
Time and Date Conditions
Use the Policy Elements Conditions page to display, create, modify, delete, duplicate, and search time and date policy element conditions. Policy elements are shared objects that define a condition that is based on specific time and date attribute settings that you configure.
Time and date conditions let you set or limit permission to access Cisco ISE system resources to specific times and days as directed by the attribute settings you make.

Use IPv6 Condition Attributes in Authorization Policies
Cisco ISE can detect, manage, and secure IPv6 traffic from endpoints.
When an IPv6-enabled endpoint connects to the Cisco ISE network, it communicates with the Network Access Device (NAD) over an IPv6 network. The NAD conveys the accounting and profiling information from the endpoint (including IPv6 values) to Cisco ISE over an IPv4 network. You can configure authorization profiles and policies in Cisco ISE using the IPv6 attributes in your rule conditions to process such requests from IPv6-enabled endpoints and ensure that the endpoint is compliant.
You can use wildcard characters in IPv6 prefix and IPv6 interface values. For example: 2001:db8:1234::/48.
Supported IPv6 address formats include:
Full notation: Eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons. For example, 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
Shortened notation: Exclude leading zeros in a group; replace groups of zeros with two consecutive colons. For example: 2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334
Dotted-quad notation (IPv4-mapped and IPv4 compatible-IPv6 addresses): For example, ::ffff:192.0.2.128
Supported IPv6 attributes include:
NAS-IPv6-Address
Framed-Interface-Id
Framed-IPv6-Prefix
Login-IPv6-Host
Framed-IPv6-Route
Framed-IPv6-Pool
Delegated-IPv6-Prefix
Framed-IPv6-Address
DNS-Server-IPv6-Address
Route-IPv6-Information
Delegated-IPv6-Prefix-Pool
Stateful-IPv6-Address-Pool
The following table lists Supported Cisco Attribute-Value pairs and their equivalent IETF attributes:
Cisco Attribute-Value Pairs
IETF Attributes
ipv6:addrv6=<ipv6 address>
Framed-ipv6-Address
ipv6:stateful-ipv6-address-pool=<name>
Stateful-IPv6-Address-Pool
ipv6:delegated-ipv6-pool=<name>
Delegated-IPv6-Prefix-Pool
ipv6:ipv6-dns-servers-addr=<ipv6 address>
DNS-Server-IPv6-Address
The RADIUS Live Logs page, RADIUS Authentication report, RADIUS Accounting report, Current Active Session report, RADIUS Error report, Misconfigured NAS report, EPS Audit report, and Misconfigured Supplicant report support IPv6 addresses. You can view the details about these sessions from the RADIUS Live Logs page or from any of these reports. You can filter the records by IPv4, IPv6, or MAC addresses.

Note
If you connect an Android device to an IPv6 enabled DHCPv6 network, it receives only the link-local IPv6 address from the DHCP server. Hence, global IPv6 address is not displayed in the Live Logs and in the Endpoints page (Administration > Identity Management > Identities > Endpoints).
The following procedure describes how to configure IPv6 attributes in authorization policies.
Before you begin
Ensure that the NADs in your deployment support AAA with IPv6. See AAA Support for IPv6 for information on how to enable AAA support for IPv6 on your NADs.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Policy > Authorization > Standard.
Step 2
Click the down arrow on the far right and select either Insert New Rule Above or Insert New Rule Below.
Step 3
Enter the rule name and specify the condition.
From the RADIUS dictionary, choose the RADIUS IPv6 attribute, the operator, and the value.
Step 4
Click Done.
Permissions for Authorization Profiles
Before you start configuring permissions for authorization profiles, make sure you:
Understand the relationship between authorization policies and profiles
Are familiar with the Authorization Profile page
Know the basic guidelines to follow when configuring policies and profiles
Understand what comprises permissions in an authorization profile
To work with Authorization Profiles, choose Policy > Policy Elements > Results. From the menu on the left, choose Authorization > Authorization Profiles.
Use the Results navigation pane as your starting point in the process for displaying, creating, modifying, deleting, duplicating, or searching policy element permissions for the different types of authorization profiles on your network. The Results pane initially displays Authentication, Authorization, Profiling, Posture, Client Provisioning, and Trustsec options.
Authorization profiles let you choose the attributes to be returned when a RADIUS request is accepted. Cisco ISE provides a mechanism where you can configure Common Tasks settings to support commonly-used attributes. You must enter the value for the Common Tasks attributes, which Cisco ISE translates to the underlying RADIUS values.

Downloadable ACLs
Access control lists (ACLs) are lists of access control entries (ACEs), which may be applied by a Policy Enforcement Point (for example, a switch) to a resource. Each ACE identifies the permissions allowed per user for that object, such as read, write, execute and more. For example, an ACL may be configured for use the Sales area of the network, with an ACE allowing Write permissions for the Sales group and a separate ACE allowing Read permissions for all other employees of the organization. With RADIUS protocol, ACLs grant authorization by filtering source and destination IP addresses, transport protocols, and additional parameters. Static ACLs reside on and are directly configured from the switch and can be applied in your authorization policies from the ISE GUI; downloadable ACLs (DACLs) can be configured, managed and applied in your authorization policies from the ISE GUI.
To implement DACLs in your network authorization policy in ISE:
Configure a new or existing DACL from Policy > Policy Elements > Results > Downloadable ACLs. For more information see Configure Permissions for Downloadable ACLs.
Configure a new or existing authorization profile from Policy > Policy Elements > Results > Authorization Profiles, using any of the DACLs you already configured. For more information, see Configure Permissions for New Standard Authorization Profiles.

With ISE, downloadable ACLs (DACLs) can be configured and implemented in your authorization policies for control of how the network is accessed by different users and groups of users. Default authorization DACLs are available with installation of ISE, including the following default profiles:
DENY_ALL_TRAFFIC
PERMIT_ALL_TRAFFIC
When working with DACLs, these defaults cannot be changed, but you can duplicate them in order to create additional, similar, DACLs.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Policy > Policy Elements > Results > Authorization > Downloadable ACLs.
Step 2
Click Add from the top of the Downloadable ACLs table or alternatively, choose any of the existing DACLs and click Duplicate from the top of the table.
Step 3
Enter or edit the desired values for the DACL, keeping in mind the following rules:
Supported characters for the name field are: alphanumeric, hyphen(-), dot( .) and underscore( _ )
The keyword Any must be the source in all ACEs in the DACL. Once the DACL is pushed, the Any in the source is replaced with the IP address of the client that is connecting to the switch.
Note 
The IP Version field is non-editable when DACL is mapped to any authorization profile. In this case, remove the DACL reference from Authorization Profiles, edit the IP version and remap the DACL in the Authorization Profiles.
Step 4
Optionally, when you finish creating the complete list of ACEs, click Check DACL Syntax to validate the list. If there are validation errors, the check returns specific instructions identifying the invalid syntax in the window that opens automatically.
Step 5
Click Submit.

Machine Access Restriction for Active Directory User Authorization
Cisco ISE contains a Machine Access Restriction (MAR) component that provides an additional means of controlling authorization for Microsoft Active Directory-authentication users. This form of authorization is based on the machine authentication of the computer used to access the Cisco ISE network. For every successful machine authentication, Cisco ISE caches the value that was received in the RADIUS Calling-Station-ID attribute (attribute 31) as evidence of a successful machine authentication.
Cisco ISE retains each Calling-Station-ID attribute value in cache until the number of hours that was configured in the “Time to Live” parameter in the Active Directory Settings page expires. Once the parameter has expired, Cisco ISE deletes it from its cache.
When a user authenticates from an end-user client, Cisco ISE searches the cache for a Calling-Station-ID value from successful machine authentications for the Calling-Station-ID value that was received in the user authentication request. If Cisco ISE finds a matching user-authentication Calling-Station-ID value in the cache, this affects how Cisco ISE assigns permissions for the user that requests authentication in the following ways:
If the Calling-Station-ID value matches one found in the Cisco ISE cache, then the authorization profile for a successful authorization is assigned.
If the Calling-Station-ID value is not found to match one in the Cisco ISE cache, then the authorization profile for a successful user authentication without machine authentication is assigned.
