Features and benefits
Mobile traffic is increasing and 5G will further add to the gridlock. Traffic congestion is typically managed by either throttling heavy users or adding more cell sites, but neither is a popular choice. Network optimization tools from Cisco can reduce congestion, improve user experience, and save time and money.
Maximize return on investment
Optimize your network to carry more traffic over existing infrastructure.
Reduce costs
Avoid expensive overbuild while enhancing network performance and decreasing cost per bit.
Improve user experience
Satisfied customers are loyal customers â€“ continuous machine learning improves traffic optimization and user experience, especially during peak hours.
