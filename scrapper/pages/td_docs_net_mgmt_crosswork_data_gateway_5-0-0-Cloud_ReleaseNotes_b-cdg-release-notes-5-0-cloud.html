This document provides information about Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway 5.0 for Cloud applications, including features, compatibility information, known issues, and limitations.
Product Overview
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway is a model-driven scalable data collection platform that enables real-time data collection from multi-protocol capable devices, thereby reducing the need for multiple collection points for multiple applications requiring data from the network.
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway offers central visibility into services collecting data and the type of data being collected.
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway is not a standalone product and is expected to be used with Crosswork Cloud applications. There is no separate software license needed for Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway.
Release Details
Cisco releases updated builds of Crosswork Data Gateway on the Cisco Support & Software Download site.
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway can be installed into a data center using any of the platforms listed in the following table. The file used for deployment is unique to each of these environments.
Table 1. Crosswork Data Gateway 5.0 Supported Virtualization Platforms
Platform
File Extension
VMware
*.ova
Note
  When using the latest Mozilla Firefox version to download the .ova image, if the downloaded file has the extension as .dms, change the extension back to .ova before installation.
OpenStack Platform
*.qcow2
Amazon EC2
.ami

Note
Direct upgrade from a previous Crosswork Data Gateway version is not supported. You must create a new VM with the same parameters that replaces the existing Crosswork Data Gateway.
What's New
This section lists the features and enhancements delivered in Crosswork Data Gateway 5.0 for Cloud Applications.
Table 2. New Features in Crosswork Data Gateway 5.0 for Cloud Applications
Feature
Description
Ability to configure multiple Syslog servers1
In the Day 0 configuration, you can configure many remote servers to use the same port and protocol. After the Day 1 configuration, you can modify the remote server settings using the interactive menu in the 5.0 release. You can customize the server IP, port, protocol, TLS peer name, and Syslog root certificate with this option.
When one of the servers becomes inaccessible, a standby server takes its place to ensure continuity. The objective of having numerous servers is to achieve high availability.
Option to modify the interface address1
Crosswork Data Gateway allows you to modify the interfaces that are already associated with a data gateway instance after it has been installed. When Crosswork Data Gateway indicates IP address difficulties such as address conflicts or erroneous addresses, this may be required.
Reconfiguring an interface involves modifying the interface name, assigning it an IP address, and obtaining access to the security group that is linked to it.
Included the auto-configuration functionality to deploy Crosswork Data Gateway
Auto-configuration feature discovers the missing configuration parameters and automatically introduces the required parameters to install Base VM. The auto-configuration approach defines only the essential parameters with default values in the Day 0 configuration.
The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) framework is used to communicate the configuration settings.
For more information about auto-configuration feature, see the Auto-configuration for Deploying Crosswork Data Gateway section in Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway 5.0 Installation and Configuration Guide for Cloud Applications.
Support to assign roles to the vNICs
Role assignment allows you to control the traffic that an interface must handle. If the preassigned roles don’t meet your organization's specific needs, you can explicitly assign roles to interfaces.
Each parameter has a predefined role. The parameter accepts the interface value as eth0, eth1, or eth2. The fourth interface, eth3, allows you to separate SSH, management, control (Crosswork Cloud service), and northbound data, and southbound data traffic.
1 For more information about the features, see Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway 5.0 Installation and Configuration Guide for Cloud Applications.
Compatibility Information
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway 5.0 for Cloud applications has been validated for use with the following Crosswork Cloud applications:
Cisco Crosswork Trust Insights is the cloud-based SaaS solution that reports on the integrity of devices and provides forensics for assured inventory.
Cisco Crosswork Cloud Traffic Analysis is the cloud-based SaaS solution that provides rich analysis, visualization, and optimization recommendations for network traffic flows.
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway must be deployed using the Crosswork Cloud profile for use with Crosswork Cloud applications. For information on deployment, see Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway 5.0 Installation and Configuration Guide for Cloud Applications.
The following tables list the software requirements for the supported virtualization platforms along with the physical and network resource requirements needed to support the Crosswork Data Gateway.

Note
The resource requirements to install Crosswork Data Gateway are the same for all the data centers.

Table 4. Supported Interface Configurations
Interface
Description
Interfaces
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 3
Crosswork Data Gateway can be deployed with either 1, 2, or 3, interfaces as per the following combinations:
No. of NICs
vNIC0
vNIC1
vNIC2
1
Management Traffic
Control/Data Traffic (Northbound traffic)
Device Access Traffic (Southbound traffic)
—
—
2
Management Traffic
Control/Data Traffic (Northbound traffic)
Device Access Traffic (Southbound traffic)
—
3
Management Traffic
Control/Data Traffic (Northbound traffic)
Device Access Traffic (Southbound traffic)
Management traffic: for accessing the Interactive Console and troubleshooting the Crosswork Data Gateway VM.
Control/Data traffic: to receive configuration of collection jobs from the Crosswork Cloud and to forward collected data to the Crosswork Cloud.
Important
  Crosswork Data Gateway can connect to the Cloud only when the Control/Data interface has access to the Internet. For more information on the ports used and how to secure the interface, see Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway 5.0 Installation and Configuration Guide for Cloud Applications.
Device access traffic: for device management and telemetry data.
Table 5. Configuration Options
Option
Description
IP Addresses
One, two, or three IPv4 or IPv6 addresses based on the number of interfaces you choose to use.
Note
  Crosswork does not support dual stack configurations. Therefore, ALL addresses for the environment must be either IPv4 or IPv6.
NTP Servers
The IPv4 or IPv6 addresses or host names of the NTP servers you plan to use. If you want to enter multiple NTP servers, separate them with spaces. These should be the same NTP servers you use to synchronize devices, clients, and servers across your network.
Note
  Confirm that the NTP IP address or host name is reachable on the network or installation fails.
The Crosswork Data Gateway host and virtual machine must be synchronized to an NTP server or the enrollment with Crosswork Cloud may not go through.
DNS Servers
The IPv4 or IPv6 addresses of the DNS servers you plan to use. If you want to enter multiple DNS servers, separate them with spaces. These should be the same DNS servers you use to resolve host names across your network.
DNS Search Domain
The search domain you want to use with the DNS servers (for example, cisco.com). You can only have one search domain.
(Optional) Proxy Server
URL of an optional management network proxy server.
If your environment requires an HTTP or HTTPS proxy in order to access URLs on the public Internet, you must configure a proxy server for the Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway to successfully connect to the Crosswork Cloud service.
(Optional) Syslog Server
Hostname, IPv4, or IPv6 address of an optional syslog server.
(Optional) Auditd Server
Hostname, IPv4, or IPv6 address of an optional Auditd server.
