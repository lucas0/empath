Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCvs62144 DOC: ISE stops requiring Adobe Flash player from 2.4
Problem Description
Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) releases listed in the Products Affected section require Adobe Flash, and full functionality requires that Adobe Flash be installed on the system and that Flash-based content is enabled.
Background
In accordance with Adobe’s End-of-Life announcement, Adobe might block Flash-based content and will no longer distribute or support Flash software after 2020-12-31. In addition, third-party software updates from operating system vendors and/or browser vendors might also block Flash-based content after 2020-12-31.
Even if Flash-based content works normally after 2020-12-31, the lack of Flash maintenance updates from Adobe introduces various levels of risk that administrators should evaluate.
Cisco has migrated from Flash to alternate technologies. Refer to the Workaround/Solution section for specific details on this product.
The Cisco ISE software utilizes Adobe Flash for some of the web user interface functionality. Adobe Flash dependencies for ISE were officially removed in ISE Release 2.4 and later. Versions of ISE that were released earlier than Release 2.4 still utilize Adobe Flash.
Problem Symptom
After 2020-12-31, if Adobe Flash-based content is blocked or if Flash cannot be downloaded or installed, affected products might lose full functionality.
If Adobe Flash-based content is enabled on a system with Flash already installed, affected products might or might not continue to operate normally after 2020-12-31, depending on the organization’s operating system and browser environments.
For the affected ISE versions, if the system administrator does not have Adobe Flash Player installed or if Flash-based content is blocked, then ISE might lose full functionality. For example, access to the pages for Backup and Restore functions (Administration > System > Backup > Restore) and TCP Dump (Operations Troubleshoot > Diagnostic Tools > TCP Dump) will fail.
  Workaround/Solution
In order to resolve all Adobe Flash dependencies, upgrade the ISE system software to Release 2.4 or later.
