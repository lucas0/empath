Introduction
This document demonstrates the use of an ISDN Basic Rate Interface (BRI) line to back up a leased line, WAN, or serial connection using the dialer watch feature. For more information on the features and operation of dialer watch, refer to Evaluating Backup Interfaces, Floating Static Routes, and Dialer Watch for DDR Backup.

Conventions

Prerequisites
Configuring DDR backup involves two distinct steps:
Configure the DDR with either legacy DDR or dialer profiles. Verify that your DDR connection functions correctly before implementing the backup configuration. This allows you to verify the dial method used, the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) negotiation, and authentication are successful before configuring backup.
Configure the router to initiate the backup DDR connection when the primary link fails. This configuration uses the dialer watch feature to trigger the dialout.
For more information on the steps necessary to configure backup refer to the document Configuring and Troubleshooting DDR Backup.
Components Used
The information in this document is based on the software and hardware versions below.
Two Cisco 2500 routers (Frame Relay DTEs) running Cisco IOS?? Software Releases 12.2(3) and 12.2(5).
One Cisco 4500 router, acting as a Frame Relay switch (configuration not shown).
The information presented in this document was created from devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If you are working in a live network, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command before using it.
Background Theory
This example uses Dialer Profiles for the backup BRI link. You can also use legacy dial-on-demand routing (DDR), which uses the dialer map command for the backup BRI connection. For more information on configuring dialer watch with dialer maps, refer to Configuring DDR Backup using BRIs and Dialer Watch.
Configure
In this section, you are presented with the information to configure the features described in this document.

Note:  The configuration of maui-nas-05 does not include any backup-related commands. For maui-nas-05, the backup link is just another dialin client. This can simplify the configuration of the central site in situations where many devices establish a backup link to the same central site. In backup scenarios, it is ideal to have only one side initiate the dial, while the other side only accepts calls.
Dialer Watch Commands
The following is a list of the commands available for dialer watch. Some of these commands have been included in the configuration above, while others are provided for reference.
dialer watch-list group-number ip ip-address address-mask : Defines the IP addresses or networks to be watched. The address or network (with the correct mask) that is configured must exist in the routing table. You can also watch multiple routes with the dialer watch-list command. An example is shown:
dialer watch-list 1 ip 10.1.1.0 255.255.255.0
dialer watch-list 1 ip 10.1.2.0 255.255.255.0
dialer watch-list 1 ip 10.1.3.0 255.255.255.0
dialer watch-group group-number : Enable dialer watch on the backup interface. The group number used here matches the group number of the dialer watch-list command defining the routes to be watched. The dialer watch-group command with a particular group number can only be configured on one interface. This means that the router cannot use multiple interfaces to provide backup for a particular route. However, one interface can have multiple dialer watch-group commands, with different group-numbers. Therefore, one interface can be used to provide backup for multiple routes.
dialer watch-disable seconds : Apply a disable delay time to the interface. After the primary interface recovers, this delay prevents disconnecting the backup interface for the specified time period. This delay timer is started when the idle timer expires, and the status of the primary route is checked and found to be up. This delay can ensure stability, especially for flapping interfaces or interfaces experiencing frequent route changes.
dialer watch-list group-number delay route-check initial seconds : This command enables the router to check whether the primary route is up after the initial startup of the router is complete and the timer (in seconds) expires. Without this command, dialer watch is only triggered when the primary route is removed from the routing table. If the primary link fails to come up during initial startup of the router, the route is never added to the routing table and hence cannot be watched. Therefore, with this command, dialer watch will dial the backup link in the event of a primary link failure during the initial start up of the router.
Verify
This section provides information you can use to confirm your configuration is working properly.
Certain show commands are supported by the Output Interpreter tool, which allows you to view an analysis of show command output.
show interfaces serial - Displays information about the multicast data-link connection identifier (DLCI), the DLCIs used on the interface, and the DLCI used for the Local Management Interface (LMI). Use this to verify that the primary interface is up or down.
show interface dialer - Displays the status of the dialer interface.
show ip route - Displays IP routing table entries. Verify that the watched network exists in the routing table (when primary link is up). When the primary link goes down and the backup is dialed the routing table should reconverge and the watched network should reappear (with next hop as the dialer interface).
Troubleshoot
This section provides information you can use to troubleshoot your configuration.
The Frame Relay configuration used here (with point-to-point subinterfaces and using Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) as a routing protocol) is specific to this setup. However, the troubleshooting steps given below are more general and can be used with different configurations like Frame Relay point-to-multipoint or primary link with High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) and Point to Point Protocol (PPP) encapsulation, regardless of the routing protocol being used.
To verify the backup functionality, we have placed one of the interfaces on the Cisco 4500 router that is acting as a Frame Relay switch in shutdown state, in order to simulate problems within the Frame Relay network. Consequently, this leads to the PVC inactive state being conducted to the DTE router via the Frame Relay network, and a Frame Relay subinterface down event. The watched route consequently disappears and the backup link is activated.
For information on Troubleshooting Dialer Watch refer to the document Configuring and Troubleshooting DDR Backup.
Troubleshooting Commands
Certain show commands are supported by the Output Interpreter tool, which allows you to view an analysis of show command output.
Note: Before issuing debug commands, please see Important Information on Debug Commands.
debug isdn q931 - Displays information about call setup and teardown of ISDN network connections (Layer 3) between the local router (user side) and the network.
debug backup - Debugs backup events.
debug dialer - Displays debugging information about the packets or events on a dialer interface.
debug ppp negotiation - Causes the debug ppp command to display PPP packets transmitted during PPP startup, where PPP options are negotiated.
debug ppp authentication - Causes the debug ppp command to display authentication protocol messages, including Challenge Authentication Protocol (CHAP) packet exchanges and Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) exchanges.
debug ip ospf events - Displays information on OSPF-related events, such as adjacencies, flooding information, designated router selection, and shortest path first (SPF) calculation.
debug frame-relay events - Displays debugging information about Frame Relay Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) replies on networks that support a multicast channel and use dynamic addressing.
