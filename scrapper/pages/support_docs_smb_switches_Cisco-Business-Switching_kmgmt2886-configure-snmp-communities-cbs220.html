Objective
This document aims to show you how to configure an SNMP community on a Cisco Business 220 series switch.
Introduction
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a network management protocol which helps to record, store, and share information about the devices in the network. This helps the administrator address network issues. Access rights in SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 are managed by the definition of communities. Community names are shared keys between the SNMP management stations and the devices. It assumes that SNMP Views has already been configured for the device.
For information on configuring SNMP views, check out:

Configure SNMP Community on a Switch
Step 1
Log in to the web user interface (UI) of your switch.
Step 2
Choose SNMP > Communities.
Step 3
Click Add to create a new SNMP community.
Step 4
In the Community String field, enter the community name used to authenticate the management station to the device.
Step 5
Select a community type. The options are:
Basic - Basic mode helps choose the community access level. The options are:
Read Only - Users are only allowed to read.
Read Write - Users can read, write and can change the device configuration. However they wonâ€™t be able to modify the community.
SNMP Admin - All users can access all device configuration and can modify the community.
Advanced - It gives access rights to group members associated with the group name. Choose the group name from the Group Name drop-down list.
In this example, Basic is chosen.
Step 6
(Optional) Check the View Name check box and choose the name of the SNMP view from the View Name drop-down list that specifies the collection of MIB subtrees to which access is granted. This allows you to give appropriate permissions based on the option chosen from the Basic mode.
The View Name option is not available when in SNMP Admin or in Advanced mode.
Step 7
Click Apply.
Step 8
Click Save to save the settings to the startup configuration file.
You have now successfully added a community on the switch.
Manage SNMP Community
Step 1
Login to the web UI of the switch and navigate to SNMP > Communities.
Step 2
Check the check box for the community that you need to edit and then click the Edit button.
Step 3
Edit the desired fields and click Apply.
Step 4
(Optional) In order to delete the communities from the Community Table, check the corresponding check box and click Delete.
Step 5

You have now successfully edited or deleted an SNMP community from your switch.
