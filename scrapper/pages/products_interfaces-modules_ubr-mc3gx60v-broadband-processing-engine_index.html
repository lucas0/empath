Cost-Effectively Prepare for IP Traffic Growth
The Cisco uBR-MC3GX60V Broadband Processing Engine (BPE) is a high-capacity, DOCSIS 3.0-capable line card for the Cisco uBR10012 Universal Broadband Router.
With 72 DOCSIS downstream and 60 upstream channels per card, the uBR-MC3X60V BPE sets a new benchmark for scalable, reliable, and cost-effective DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem termination system (CMTS) solutions.
20 Times the Speed at a Fraction of the Cost*
As the first and only CMTS product to support both the integrated and modular CableLabs CMTS architectures in the same chassis, the uBR10012 provides a broad range of configuration options. The uBR-MC3GX60V BPE provides excellent scalability while significantly reducing the per-channel cost of the CMTS.
The combination of Cisco uBR-MC3GX60V and Cisco RFGW10 platforms provide industry-leading capacity and maintain the highest standards of reliability and availability. Comprehensive line card and supervisor redundancy on both carrier-class platforms results in:
Faster time to market
Dramatically lower total cost of ownership
Higher revenues than previously possible
All this will help you prepare your cable network for exponential growth in IP video traffic.
