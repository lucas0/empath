    Transform data-center and cloud-network operations with simplicity, automation, and analytics
In this era of digital transformation and business resiliency, continuous innovation is critical for organizations to succeed, and experiencing downtime along the way is not an option. Users increasingly demand more features and better usability, reliability, and environmental sustainability from the applications they use.
The network plays a huge role in meeting such demands, and provisioning reliable data-center and cloud-networking services as fast as possible, when and where organizations need it, is a must. However, network infrastructure management is becoming more complex, diverse, and distributed, with multiple configuration points, monitoring tools, and vast amounts of data being generated every second

Network complexity in a hyper-diverse and hyper-distributed world
Included with every Cisco Nexus® 9000 switch tiered licensing purchase,* Cisco Nexus Dashboard provides a single focal point to unite disparate network configurations and views of multiple switches, data centers, and clouds (Figure 2).

Cisco Nexus Dashboard powers automation and analytics with a unified, agile, and sustainable networking platform.
By providing a single point of management that empowers users to provision and operate their networks across different switches, fabrics, and locations, Cisco Nex––us Dashboard is evolving to become the simplest way to provision, monitor, and manage data-center and cloud networks.
Cisco Nexus Dashboard provides multiple services (Figure 3) that bring one of the best on-premises and cloud operational models to your networks, whether Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure™ (Cisco ACI), Cisco NX-OS (through its Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller service), or a Cisco® Cloud Network Controller running in a public cloud provider environment.
