   Problem Description
All Client Layer Interface Port (CLIP) cards deployed in the field have threshold settings for the Peltier current that are too low. This may cause an incorrect display of the "low" (or "high") warning alarm.

  mcu mcu_1_1   |  7   | dwdm peltiercurrent  | lw (-61.8 pc)
  ...
Background
The current threshold numbers for the percentages are as follows:
hat (high alarm)    : 80%
     hwt (high warning)  : 60%


     lwt (low warning)   : -60%
     lat (low alarm)     : -80%
The laser temperature is calibrated and kept constant through regulation of the Peltier current. For the alarm levels, the percentage is based on the maximum heating and cooling current that the CLIP can produce. The alarm thresholds will be the same for all CLIPs.
Example :
clip_test:#list recursive
  clip_test:...
   dwdm:...
    peltiercurrent:
     status = lowwarning 
     value  = -63.3 pc
     hat    =  80.0 pc
     hwt    =  60.0 pc
     lwt    =  -60.0 pc
     lat    =  -80.0 pc
     unit   =  percent 
     pmvalue=  uninitialised
Problem Symptoms
The reason for increasing the threshold levels is a change in maximum available Peltier cooling current from 1.2 A to 900 mA. Initial CLIP design used 60 percent as the Peltier current warning threshold. This was based on a maximum cooling current of 1.2 A for CLIP revision 3.0. All CLIPs revision 3.2 and higher, which are the only ones deployed in the field, have a maximum cooling current of 900 mA. As a result, the Peltier current threshold levels should be raised to 80 percent to keep the current level that triggers the alarm constant. Although the threshold window is increased, the warning will now be raised at the intended cooling current.
Workaround/Solution
In order to reflect the lower maximum cooling current used by the CLIPs, readjust the Peltier current threshold to :
hat (high alarm)    : 95%
  hwt (high warning)  : 80%

  lwt (low warning)   : -80%
  lat (low alarm)     : -95%
Example :
clip_test:#list recursive
  clip_test:...
   dwdm:...
    peltiercurrent:
     status = normal
     value  = -63.3 pc
     hat    =  95.0 pc
     hwt    =  80.0 pc
     lwt    =  -80.0 pc
     lat    =  -95.0 pc
     unit   =  percent 
     pmvalue=  uninitialised
