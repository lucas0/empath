Create a Monitoring Node Backup
Introduction
This document describes how to restore a Monitoring Node backup to a server different than the one on which it was taken.
Prerequisites
Requirements
There are no specific requirements for this document.
Components Used
The information in this document is based on Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) Version 1.1.x.
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Create a Monitoring Node Backup
Generate a backup for the current Monitoring Node via the CLI or the admin GUI.
Generate a Full Backup On Demand from the target Monitoring Node.
Check the repository in which the backup is stored for these files:
Mntdbfull_hostname_date_time.tar.gpg
ise_catalog.xml
Copy the backup from the current node to the repository which hosts the ise_catalog.xml file.
Edit the ise_catalog.xml file to point to the backup file you want to restore to the new node. This example restores a backup named ProductionMNT.gpg.
From:
<void property="fullImage"> 
 <string>mntdbfull_ise-rec5_20130627_110059</string>

To: 
<void property="fullImage"> 
 <string>ProductionMNT</string>
In the Admin GUI, navigate to Administration > System > Maintenance > Data Management > Monitoring Node > Data Restore. Notice that the previous backups include the ProductionMNT.gpg file.
Choose the backup you want to restore, enter the Encryption Key used when the backup was created, and click restore.
Allow the restore to run to completion. Do not navigate to another location in the GUI or make changes while the restore runs. This process can take some time. Once the restore is complete, the ISE Services on the node restart.
