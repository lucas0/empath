    Video traffic continues to grow rapidly. It would take more than 5 million years to watch the amount of video that will cross global IP networks each month in 2021. Every second, a million minutes of video content will cross the network. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) will carry 71 percent of Internet traffic by 2021. Content providers will need to scale their networks at speed to keep up with the demand for more video. Networks needs to be designed with “web-scale” in mind. A web-scale network needs to scale at deployment speed while being operationally simple. Network Convergence System 1004 uses state of the art silicon along with complete automation and real-time visibility to deliver a universal transponder solution that provides best-in-class performance for metro, long-haul and submarine applications while being simple to deploy and manage.
Product features and benefits
NCS1004 1.2T transponder can provide up to 12 100Gbe/OTU4 client ports. The client ports map to two trunk ports operating any rate between 100G and 600G in 50G increments. The baud-rate, modulation format and FEC of each trunk port is software-configurable per slice, where each slice is a combination of a sequence of 6 client ports.
The trunk ports are capable of several line rates with fine control of modulation format, baud-rate and forward error correction allowing the solution to be used for metro, terrestrial long-haul or submarine applications:
●      The baud-rate can be controlled between 28Gbd/s and 72Gbd/s.
●      The modulation format can be controlled between BPSK, QPSK, 8-QAM, 16QAM, 32QAM and 64QAM.
●      Hybrids between modulation formats can be configured to achieve 0.001 bits/symbol of granularity.
●      Forward Error Correction (FEC) of 27% and 15% overhead.
●      Trunk line rate from 50G to 600G in 100G increments.

Cisco NCS 1004 1.2T C band line card
The Cisco NCS 1004 system provides the following hardware benefits:
●      Transport of any trunk rate between 100 and 600-Gbps wavelengths on the same platform through software provisioning.
●      Support of granular control of baud-rate and modulation format to maximize spectral efficiency.
●      One universal transponder that is performance optimized for metro, long-haul and submarine applications.
●      Support for up to 350,000 ps/nm of residual chromatic dispersion compensation.
●      Transport of 100GE, OTU4 and 400GE on the same platform through software provisioning.
●      600G DWDM provides unparalleled scale and density. With 64 channels of 600G at 75Ghz, the NCS 1004 provides 38.4Tbps in 16RU.
●      State of the art AES-256 Encryption at scale – 4.8Tbps of encrypted trunk capacity per 2RU.
●      Non-Linear Compensation for maximum performance on compensated legacy subsea cables and for non-linear terrestrial fibers.
●      SOP tracking speed of up to 10 million rad/s for aerial fiber applications.
Modulation schemes
The Cisco NCS 1004 1.2T transponder features a software configurable modulation scheme per slice, allowing the operator to customize the spectral efficiency and reach characteristics of individual wavelengths. Supported modulation formats are detailed in Table 1.

Wavelength tunability
The line interface supports software-provision able tunability across the full C band, covering 96 channels across 191.25 to 196.10 Thz (1528.77 to 1566.72 nm). Grid-less tuning support allows for continuous tunability in increments of 0.1 GHz and the ability to create multicarrier super-channels over flex spectrum line systems.
Protocol transparency
The Cisco NCS 1004 1.2T transponder can transparently deliver 100Gbe and OTU4 clients over 2x 100G-600G.
Fine Control of Coherent DWDM interface
The Cisco NCS 1004 1.2T transponder provides the ability to modify baud-rate and modulation format with fine control to meet capacity and reach requirements for a range of use-cases as shown in Figure 2.
●      Use 69Gbaud/s line rates to maximize capacity at lowest price per bit for Metro and Long-Haul networks.
●      Use real-time network bandwidth and performance data to maximize line rate capacity on coherent DWDM interface.
●      Support line rates that can maximize capacity for bandwidth constrained 50Ghz and 100Ghz spaced legacy ROADM networks.
●      Maximize spectral efficiency on submarine cable line system for the target Q-margin.

Encryption
With increasing asks for data privacy and data protection across the globe, encryption of any data that leaves the Data Center facility is becoming an important requirement for cloud operators. The NCS 1004 1.2T line card provides AES256 based OTN-Sec encryption for 100GE and OTU4. IKEv2 is used for authentication of the devices in an encryption session and the protocol provides pre-shared keys, certificates or 802.1X based authentication options. Elliptical Curve Diffie Hillman (ECDH) Key Exchange protocol runs over a GCC (Generic Communication Channel) between two NCS1004 1.2T line card nodes.
Management
The Cisco NCS 1004 1.2T line card supports all management feature as mentioned in the NCS 1004 system datasheet.
Performance monitoring
The Cisco NCS 1004 1.2T line card supports performance monitoring of optical parameters on the client and DWDM line interface including laser bias current, transmit and receive optical power. Ethernet RMON statistics for the client ports and OTN error counters for the trunk are also available. Calculation and accumulation of the performance-monitoring data are supported in 15-minute and 24-hour intervals as per G.7710. Physical system parameters measured at the wavelength level, such as mean polarization mode dispersion, accumulated chromatic dispersion, pre-FEC Bit Error Rate and received Optical Signal-to-Noise Ratio (OSNR) are also included in the set of performance-monitoring parameters. These parameters can greatly simplify troubleshooting operations.
