Description
Multi-Region Fabric: Secondary Regions
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.8.1a
Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.8.1
Cisco vManage Release 20.8.1
Secondary regions provide another facet to the Multi-Region Fabric architecture and enable direct tunnel connections between edge routers in different primary access regions. When you assign an edge router a secondary region, the router effectively operates in two regions simultaneously, and has different paths available through its primary and secondary regions.
Information About Secondary Regions
Minimum supported releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.8.1a, Cisco vManage Release 20.8.1
In the most basic Multi-Region Fabric architecture, each device belongs to a single region. Connections from an edge router in one region to an edge router in another region are routed through border routers and region 0 and therefore require multiple hops.
Secondary regions provide another facet to the architecture and enable additional functionality. A secondary region operates more simply than a primary region: it contains only edge routers and it enables direct tunnel connections between edge routers in different primary regions. When you add an edge router to a secondary region, the router effectively operates in two regions simultaneously, and has different paths available through its primary and secondary regions.
You can create multiple secondary regions within the network to address the specific routing needs of different sets of edge routers, but an edge router cannot belong to more than one secondary region.
Figure 1. Multi-Region Fabric with a Secondary Region
Using Secondary Regions
You can configure secondary region paths for any of the following:
Load balancing using paths in the primary and secondary regions
Directing specific applications to use a secondary-region path, which can be a premium path with better performance
Primary-Region Path and Secondary-Region Path
When a direct path is available to reach a destination, by default the overlay management protocol (OMP) enables only the direct path to the routing forwarding layer because the direct path uses fewer hops. The result is that the forwarding layer, which includes application-aware policy, can only use the direct path. You can disable this comparison of the number of hops so that traffic can use either the direct secondary-region path (fewer hops) or the primary-region path (more hops). When you disable the comparison of the number of hops, OMP applies equal-cost multi-path routing (ECMP) to all routes, and packets can use all available paths. See Configure a Device to Use Both the Primary-Region Path and Secondary-Region Path Using Cisco vManage.

Control Policy
When creating a control policy for the Cisco vSmart controller for the secondary region, you can match traffic according to whether it is using a primary-region path or a secondary-region path.
Workflow
On a device, configure a secondary region at the device level.
See Configure a Secondary Region ID for an Edge Router Using Cisco vManage.
On the device, specify the TLOCs that can use the secondary region.
See Configure the Secondary Region Mode of a TLOC Using the CLI.
Configure the TLOC to operate either in the secondary region only, or in both the primary and secondary regions.
See Configure the Secondary Region Mode for a TLOC Using Cisco vManage.
Enable the device to use both the primary region path and the secondary region path.
See Configure a Device to Use Both the Primary-Region Path and Secondary-Region Path Using Cisco vManage.
Assign a Cisco vSmart controller to the secondary region. Use a Cisco vSmart controller that does not operate in any of the access regions of devices using the secondary region. To ensure this, we recommend assigning a Cisco vSmart controller that operates only in a secondary region, and does not operate in any access regions. For example, you can assign a Cisco vSmart controller that operates only in region 0 to operate also in a secondary region.
See Assign Regions to a Cisco vSmart Controller Using Cisco vManage.
Terminology
With the introduction of secondary regions to the Multi-Region Fabric architecture, it is valuable to clarify the terminology used here.
Term
Explanation or Equivalent Terms
Core region
Region 0
Access region
Any region other than region 0
Primary access region
Primary region
Secondary access region
Secondary region
Primary-region path
A path from an edge router to a border router, through the core region, to another border router, to an edge router in a different region
Secondary-region path
A direct path from an edge router 1 in one primary region to edge router 2 in another primary region, where edge routers 1 and 2 are in the same secondary region
Benefits of Secondary Regions
Benefits of Secondary Regions
Ability to route specific traffic using a direct tunnel from one edge router to another, between different primary regions.
Ability to provide high-volume throughput, such as traffic to a data center, on a direct tunnel between different primary regions. Routing the high-volume throughput directly can prevent overloading border routers with excessive traffic volume.
Matching Routes by Path Type, Region, or Role
Minimum supported releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.8.1a, Cisco vManage Release 20.8.1
Path Type
When configuring a control policy for a Multi-Region Fabric architecture, you can match routes according to whether the route is using one of the following:
Hierarchical path: Match a route that includes hops from an access region to a border router, through region 0, to another border router, then to an edge router in a different access region.
To view the hierarchical path routes, use the show sdwan omp routes command and note the routes that list three regions in the REGION PATH column.
Direct path: Match direct paths (direct routes) from one edge router to another edge router. You can enable a direct path between edge routers in different access regions by configuring a secondary region, and adding the two edge routers to the secondary region. See Information About Secondary Regions.
To view the direct path routes, use the show sdwan omp routes command and note the routes that list one region in the REGION PATH column.
Transport gateway path: Match a route that is re-originated by a router that has transport gateway functionality enabled.
For information about transport gateways, see Information About Transport Gateways.
Region and Role
Similarly to matching by path type, you can match routes by the region or role (edge router or border router) of the device that originates the route.
Restrictions for Secondary Regions
Minimum supported releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.8.1a, Cisco vManage Release 20.8.1
Secondary regions apply only to edge routers, not border routers.
A router can belong to only one secondary region.
A Cisco vSmart controller that you assign to a secondary region must not operate in any of the primary (access) regions of devices using the secondary region. To ensure this, we recommend assigning a Cisco vSmart controller that only operates in the secondary region, and does not operate in any access regions.
You cannot configure a secondary region on a router that is configured as a transport gateway.

Note
Attempting to configure a secondary region on such a router results in an error.
Use Cases for Secondary Regions
Minimum supported releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.8.1a, Cisco vManage Release 20.8.1
Use Case 1: Specific Application Traffic
An organization using a Multi-Region Fabric architecture chooses to route specific application traffic between sites in two different regions: region 1 and region 2, using a direct path route to reduce bandwidth demands on border routers. The organization arranges a carrier for this purpose between the two sites.
A network administrator configures secondary regions for an edge router in region 1 and an edge router in region 2 so that the two routers are both in secondary region 5, as follows:
Edge router ER10
Primary region: 1
Secondary region: 5
Edge router ER20
Primary region: 2
Secondary region: 5
The network administrator configures a direct tunnel between edge router ER10 and edge router ER20 and configures a policy that routes the specific application traffic through the direct tunnel.
Use Case 2: High Volume Data Center
An organization using a Multi-Region Fabric architecture has a data center in region 1, served by edge router ER10. Sites in regions 2, 3, and 4 (served by edge routers ER20, ER30, and ER40) connect to the data center and generate a high volume of traffic. The organization uses a premium service provider link for the core region.
To avoid routing the high-volume data center traffic through the premium link used in the core region, the network administrator configures a secondary region that includes the data center (ER10), and includes each of the remote sites (ER20, ER30, and ER40) to enable them to connect to the data center using direct tunnels. Using direct tunnels for the high-volume traffic reduces the bandwidth demands on the core region.
The primary and secondary region configuration is as follows:
Data center: Edge router ER10
Primary region: 1
Secondary region: 5
Remote site: Edge router ER20
Primary region: 2
Secondary region: 5
Remote site: Edge router ER30
Primary region: 3
Secondary region: 5
Remote site: Edge router ER40
Primary region: 4
Secondary region: 5
