Your Cisco vManage needs to run Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1, if you want to upgrade to Cisco vManage Release 20.10.1. You can’t upgrade directly to Cisco vManage Release 20.10.1 from Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1 and Cisco vManage Release 20.8.1.
If you are upgrading Cisco vManage in clusters from Cisco SD-WAN Controllers Release 20.9.x to 20.10.x, the configuration database might be empty. Starting from Cisco SD-WAN Controllers Release 20.10.x, the configuration database version is upgraded to 4.4.5 from 4.1.1. Here are the instructions to upgrade the configuration database manually:
Ensure that you have a snapshot or backup of the database that you are going to update using the following command:
device# request nms configuration-db backup path <file-name>
Install the Cisco vManage image binaries to the nodes of the cluster that you want to upgrade using the following command:
device# request software install <path>

Note
Install the image and do not activate.
Stop NMS services on all the Cisco vManage cluster nodes using the following command:
device# request nms configuration-db stop
Activate the image binaries on each of the Cisco vManage node in the cluster using the following command:
device# request software activate <version>
Upgrade the configuration database on any one of the nodes in the cluster that has the configuration database enabled using the following command:
device# request nms configuration-db upgrade
The configuration database (config-db) is now upgraded to the version 4.4.5.
