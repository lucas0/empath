Three-year recertification requirement
Certification cycle
Associate, Professional and Expert-level certifications will be active for three years from the date certification is achieved. Certified individuals will be able to recertify by completing continuing education activities, taking exams, or a combination of both. Each time recertification requirements are met the certification active status will be extended for an additional three years. For reference, here's an example of how the recertification cycle works:
Certified: Feb 1, 2019, expiration: Feb 1, 2022
Recertify: Nov 1, 2019, expiration: Nov 1, 2022
Recertify: Aug 1, 2020, expiration: Aug 1, 2023
Expert level certifications are now valid for three years. The suspend status no longer exists. All other recertifications requirements apply.
The Cisco Certified Support Technician (CCST) entry-level certifications are valid for a lifetime and does not have an expiration date, therefore will not require recertification.

Recertification requirements
All requirements for recertification must be met by the certification expiration date. Individuals with expired certification(s) must complete the full examination process again to earn active status. Recertification can occur at any time during the active period by advancing to the next level of certifications, earning continuing education credits, or a combination of both.
