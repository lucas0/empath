Description
Per-Tunnel QoS
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r
This feature lets you apply a Quality of Service (QoS) policy on individual tunnels, ensuring that branch offices with smaller throughput are not overwhelmed by larger aggregation sites.
This feature is only supported for hub-to-spoke network topologies.

Overview of Per-Tunnel QoS
Use the Per-tunnel QoS feature to apply a quality of service (QoS) policy on a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device hub on a per-tunnel or per-spoke instance in the egress direction.
Per-tunnel QoS can only be applied on hub-to-spoke network topologies. Per-tunnel QoS on a hub lets you shape tunnel traffic to individual spokes. It also differentiates individual data flows going through the tunnel or the spoke for policing.

Note
Starting from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.11.1a, you can add the maximum number of sessions to which the QOS policy is applied. When the SD-WAN user sessions with QoS policy reach the maximum limit, QoS policy is not applied for any other sessions. The number of sessions that you can configure is from 100 to 6000. The default QoS maximum session is 4000.
Benefits of Per-Tunnel QoS
Before the introduction of Per-tunnel QoS feature on Cisco SD-WAN, QoS on a hub could be configured to measure only the aggregate outbound traffic for all spokes. Per-tunnel QoS for Cisco SD-WAN provides the following benefits.
A QoS policy is configurable on the basis of session groups, thus providing the capability of regulating traffic from hub to spokes at a per-spoke level.
The hub cannot send excessive traffic to a small spoke and overrun it.
The maximum outbound bandwidth and QoS queue are set up automatically when each spoke registers with an Overlay Management Protocol (OMP) message.
The amount of outbound hub bandwidth that a “greedy” spoke can consume can be limited; therefore, the traffic can’t monopolize a hub’s resources and starve other spokes.
Multiple policies (MPoL) are supported. This enables underlay and TLOC extension traffic to coexist with the overlay tunnel traffic.

Restrictions for Per-Tunnel QoS
The following restrictions apply to the Per-tunnel QoS feature in Cisco SD-WAN.
Only hub-to-spoke network topology is supported for configuring per-tunnel QoS. Spoke-to-spoke network topology isn't supported.
Only Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices are supported as hubs for per-tunnel QoS. However, both Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices and Cisco vEdge devices are supported as spokes in the hub-to-spoke topology supported for per-tunnel QoS.
In Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r, per-tunnel QoS can only be configured using the Cisco VPN Interface Ethernet template in Cisco vManage 20.1.1.
Per-tunnel QoS with loopback WAN for non-binding mode isn’t supported on the hub.
For per-tunnel QoS to work with 3-level hierarchical policies, you must use the reserved class-map name, "SDWAN_underlay" for middle level policy.
How Per-Tunnel QoS Works in Hub-to-Spoke Topologies
In Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2 , the Per-Tunnel QoS feature is supported on hub-to-spoke network topologies only. Per-tunnel QoS is not supported for spoke-to-spoke topology.
Per-tunnel QoS is applied to routers with the hub role on a per-session basis.
Routers that are assigned the spoke role publish the downstream-bandwidth information per TLOC route through OMP.
Overlay and underlay tunnels share the same QoS policy and the bandwidth remaining is configurable for both underlay and overlay tunnels.
The bandwidth remaining ratio is automatically calculated on each session based on the remote downstream bandwidth.
Configure Per Tunnel QoS Using Cisco vManage
To configure per-tunnel QoS, perform the following tasks in the order specified.
Step 1: Configure QoS Map
A QoS map can be added to a localized data policy. For more details on the various QoS parameters, see QoS parameters section in the Policies Guide. To configure QoS map:
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Policies.
Click Localized Policy and then click Add Policy.
From the list type shown in the left pane, choose Class Map. The list displays existing class maps. Choose a class map from the list and click Next.
OR
Create a new class map:
Click Add New Class Map.
Enter a name for the class map.
From the Queue drop-down list, choose a number (from 0-7).
Click Save and then click Next.
Click the Add QoS Map and choose Create New.
Enter a name and description for the map.
Click Add Queue, enter the requested details, and click Save Queue.
Click Save Policy.
Step 2: Choose the QoS Map to be Added to the Feature Template
Per-tunnel QoS can only be configured through the Cisco VPN Interface Ethernet template. To enable per-tunnel QoS on other WAN interface types, use the global CLI add-on template.
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Templates.
Click Feature Templates and then click Add Template.

Note
In Cisco vManage Release 20.7.x and earlier releases, Feature Templates is called Feature.
Choose a device from the list on the left. Feature templates applicable to the device are shown in the right pane.
Choose the Cisco VPN Interface Ethernet template.
Enter a name and description for the feature template.
Choose the ACL/QoS option.
Enter the requested details.
Shaping Rate: Choose Global from the drop-down list and enter a shaping rate in kbps.
QoS Map: Choose Global from the drop-down list and enter the name of the QoS map that you want to include in the feature template.
Click Save.
Step 3: Attach the Localized QoS Policy and the Feature Template to the Device Template
Attach the localized policy created in Step 1 to the device template.
Attach the feature template created in Step 2 to the device template. See Create Device Templates from Feature Templates for more details.

Note
Ensure that you attach the localized policy and the feature template to the same device template.
Step 4 Configure Hub Role for Per-Tunnel QoS
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Templates.
Click Feature Templates. All the features templates are listed.

Note
In Cisco vManage Release 20.7.x and earlier releases, Feature Templates is called Feature.
For the Cisco VPN Interface template that you want to add per-tunnel QoS policy to, click ... and choose Edit.
Alternatively, you can create a new Cisco VPN Interface Ethernet template following the instructions in the previous sections and then proceed with the steps below.
When the template opens, click the Tunnel option at the top of the page.
From the Tunnel Interface drop-down list, choose Global and choose On.
A new set of fields display below the Tunnel Interface option. These new fields are specific to per-tunnel QoS and display only when you choose the On option.
From the Per-tunnel Qos drop-down list, choose Global and then choose On.
The Per-tunnel QoS Aggregator field appears after you set Per-tunnel Qos to On. If this field is set to Off, which is the default behavior, it means that the device selected in the template is assigned the spoke role. If the field is set to On, it means that the device is assigned the hub role.
Choose Global from the Per-tunnel QoS Aggregator drop-down menu, and choose On. The device has now been assigned the role of a hub.
When you choose the On option, the Tunnel Bandwidth Percent field displays.
You can either leave the Tunnel Bandwidth Percent value at default (50) or choose Global from the drop-down menu to enter a value based on your network requirement.
The remaining fields under the Tunnel section are not specific to per-tunnel QoS. You can either leave the values at default or enter values specific to your network.
Click Update. The feature template updates with per-tunnel QoS configuration.
Step 5: Configure Spoke Role for Per-Tunnel QoS
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Templates.
Click Feature Templates. All the features templates are listed.

Note
In Cisco vManage Release 20.7.x and earlier releases, Feature Templates is called Feature.
For the Cisco VPN Interface Template that you want to add the per-tunnel QoS policy to, click ... and choose Edit.
OR
Create a new Cisco VPN Interface Ethernet template following the instructions in the previous sections and then proceed with the steps below.
When the template opens, click Tunnel.
From the Tunnel Interface drop-down list, choose Global and choose the On option.
A new set of fields display below the Tunnel Interface option. These new fields are specific to per-tunnel QoS and display only when you choose the On option.
From the Per-tunnel Qos drop-down menu, choose Global and choose the On option.
The Per-tunnel QoS Aggregator field displays after you set Per-tunnel Qos to On. This field is set to off by default. If this field is set to Off, it means that the device selected in the template is assigned the spoke role.
The downstream bandwidth needs to be configured for the device to effectively take the spoke role. To configure the downstream bandwidth, click Basic Configuration at the top of the page.
Scroll down to the Bandwidth Downstream Field and choose Global from the drop-down menu.
Enter a value for the downstream bandwidth and click Update at the bottom of the page.
