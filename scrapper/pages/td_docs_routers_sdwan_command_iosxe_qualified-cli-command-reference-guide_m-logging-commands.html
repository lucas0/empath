Command Modes

Global configuration (config)
Command History
Release
Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco vManage CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
For usage guidelines, see the Cisco IOS XE logging buffered command.
The following example shows how to enable standard system logging to the local syslog buffer:
Router(config)# logging buffered
logging console
To send system logging (syslog) messages to all available TTY lines and limit messages based on severity, use the logging console command in global configuration mode. To disable logging to the console terminal, use the no form of this command.
logging console
no logging console
Command Default
The default varies by platform. In general, the default is to log all messages.
Command Modes

Global configuration (config)
Command History
Release
Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco vManage CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
For usage guidelines, see the Cisco IOS XE logging console command.
The following is an example for this command:
Router(config)# logging console
logging host
To log system messages and debug output to a remote host, use the logging host command in global configuration mode. To remove a specified logging host from the configuration, use the no form of this command.
logging host { [ ip-address ] [ vrf vrf-value ] }
Syntax Description
ip-address
(Optional) IP address of the host that will receive the system logging (syslog) messages.

Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco vManage CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
For usage guidelines, see the Cisco IOS XE logging host command.

Note
Creating and deleting the logging host configurations in same transaction causes unexpected behaviour. For example, deleting logging host ipv4-address and creating logging host ipv4-address vrf vrf-name configuration in same transaction causes both configurations to disappear from the device. We recommend you to send the two requests in separate transactions.
In the following example, messages are logged to a host with an IP address of 172.16.150.63 connected through a VRF:
Router(config)# logging host 172.16.150.63 vrf 4

Release Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco SD-WAN Manager CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
There are various severity levels of message logging. Specifying a level causes messages at that level and numerically lower levels to be displayed at the destination. There are two syslog formats - RFC3164 and RFC5424. Use this logging trap informational syslog-format rfc5424 command to set the logging trap level to informational and the syslog format to rfc5424.
Example
The following example shows how to set the trap level to informational and syslog format to rfc5424.
Device(config)# logging trap informational syslog-format rfc5424
service timestamps
To configure the system to apply a time stamp to debugging messages or system logging messages, use the service timestamps command in global configuration mode. To disable this service, use the no form of this command.
service timestamps [ debug | | log ] { datetime } [ msec | | localtime | | show-timezone | | year ]
no service timestamps [ debug | | log ]
Syntax Description
debug
(Optional) Indicates time-stamping for debugging messages.
log
(Optional) Indicates time-stamping for system logging messages.
datetime
(Optional) Specifies that the time stamp should consist of the date and time.
The time-stamp format for datetime is MMM DD HH:MM:SS, where MMM is the month, DD is the date, HH is the hour (in 24-hour notation), MM is the minute, and SS is the second.
If the datetime keyword is specified, you can optionally add the msec , localtime , show-timezone , or year keywords.
If the service timestamps datetime command is used without addtional keywords, time stamps will be shown using UTC, without the year, without milliseconds, and without a time zone name.
msec
(Optional) Includes milliseconds in the time stamp, in the format HH: DD: MM: SS. mmm, where .mmm is milliseconds.
localtime
(Optional) Time stamp relative to the local time zone.
year
(Optional) Include the year in the date-time format.
show-timezone
(Optional) Include the time zone name in the time stamp.
Note
  If the localtime keyword option is not used (or if the local time zone has not been configured using the clock timezone command), time will be displayed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
Command Default
Time stamps are applied to debug and logging messages.
Command Modes
Global configuration (config)
Command History
Release
Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10.1a
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
For usage guidelines, see the Cisco IOS XE service timestamps command.
The following example shows how to enable time-stamping on logging messages using the current time and date in Coordinated Universal Time/Greenwich Mean Time (UTC/GMT), and enable the year to be displayed:
Device(config)# service timestamps log datetime show-timezone year
 Device(config)# end
! The following line shows the timestamp with datetime (11:13 PM March 22nd)  
.Mar 22 2004 23:13:25 UTC: %SYS-5-CONFIG_I: Configured from console by console
In the following example, the service timestamps log datetime command is used to change previously configured options for the date-time time stamp.
Device(config)# service timestamps log datetime localtime show-timezone 
Device(config)# end 
! The year is not displayed.  
Oct 13 15:44:46 PDT: %SYS-5-CONFIG_I: Configured from console by console 

Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with the end command.
Device(config)# service timestamps log datetime show-timezone year
Device(config)# end
 
! note: because the localtime option was not specified again, that option is removed from the output, 
and time is displayed in UTC (the default)
 
Oct 13 2004 22:45:31 UTC: %SYS-5-CONFIG_I: Configured from console by console
