radius-server dead-criteria
To force one or both of the criteria--used to mark a RADIUS server as dead--to be the indicated constant, use the radius-server dead-criteria command in global configuration mode. To disable the criteria that were set, use the no form of this command.
radius-server dead-criteria [ time seconds ] [ tries number-of-tries ]
no radius-server dead-criteria [ time seconds ] [ tries number-of-tries ]
Syntax Description
time seconds
(Optional) Minimum amount of time, in seconds, that must elapse from the time that the router last received a valid packet from the RADIUS server to the time the server is marked as dead. If a packet has not been received since the router booted, and there is a timeout, the time criterion will be treated as though it has been met. You can configure the time to be from 1 through 120 seconds.
If the seconds argument is not configured, the number of seconds will range from 10 to 60 seconds, depending on the transaction rate of the server.
Note
  Both the time criterion and the tries criterion must be met for the server to be marked as dead.
tries number-of-tries
(Optional) Number of consecutive timeouts that must occur on the router before the RADIUS server is marked as dead. If the server performs both authentication and accounting, both types of packets will be included in the number. Improperly constructed packets will be counted as though they were timeouts. All transmissions, including the initial transmit and all retransmits, will be counted. You can configure the number of timeouts to be from 1 through 100.
If the number-of-tries argument is not configured, the number of consecutive timeouts will range from 10 to 100, depending on the transaction rate of the server and the number of configured retransmissions.
Note
  Both the time criterion and the tries criterion must be met for the server to be marked as dead.
Command Default
The number of seconds and number of consecutive timeouts that occur before the RADIUS server is marked as dead will vary, depending on the transaction rate of the server and the number of configured retransmissions.
