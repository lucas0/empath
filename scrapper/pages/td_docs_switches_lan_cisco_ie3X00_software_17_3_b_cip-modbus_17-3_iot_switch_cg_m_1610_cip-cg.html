Information About CIP
The Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) is an industrial protocol for industrial automation applications. Previously known as Control and Information Protocol, CIP encompasses a comprehensive suite of messages and services for the collection of manufacturing automation applications - control, safety, synchronization, motion, configuration and information. It is supported by Open DeviceNet Vendors Association (ODVA), an organization that supports network technologies based upon CIP such as DeviceNet, EtherNet/IP, CIP Safety and CIP Sync. CIP allows users to integrate these manufacturing applications with enterprise-level Ethernet networks and the Internet.
CIP Restrictions
CIP can be enabled on only one VLAN on the switch.
Enabling CIP
Before you begin
By default, CIP is not enabled.
SUMMARY STEPS
