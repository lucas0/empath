    Cisco Crosswork Network Controller empowers customers to simplify and automate intent-based network service provisioning, monitoring, and optimization in a multivendor network environment with a common GUI and API.
Product overview
Network operators are facing challenges to support the exponential growth of network traffic while addressing the pressures to efficiently run network operations. Operators are reducing the management complexity by converging and collapsing their networks, migrating to Software-Defined Networks (SDNs), and automating daily operational tasks to become more efficient and competitive. Automating service lifecycle functions is vital to their success as it helps them to accelerate time to revenue, improve end-user experience, and boost the operational agility.
Cisco Crosswork Network Controller allows customers to deploy services faster and offers intent-based health monitoring and network optimization, improving service delivery while mitigating network congestion issues. Cisco Crosswork Network Controller has been shaped by the experience of helping multiple tier-one service provider and large enterprise customers automate everything from simple device turn-up to sophisticated full lifecycle service management. It delivers critical capabilities for automating service orchestration and fulfilment, network optimization, service path computation, service health monitoring, along with programmable closed-loop. The underlying goal is to preserve the service policy intent and associated SLA.
As a turnkey solution, Cisco Crosswork Network Controller combines multiple innovative, industry-leading capabilities such as Advanced Traffic Engineering, Segment Routing Path Computation Element (SR-PCE), Flexible Algorithms, Intent-based Assurance — with common API and UI, providing visibility and control via a single pane of glass.
With Cisco Crosswork Network Controller, you can realize a number of outcomes:
●      Segment Routing (SR) policy provisioning with explicit intent (for example, bandwidth constraints, latency minimization, etc)
●      Services provisioning (for example, L2VPN, L3VPN services with associated segment routing policy)
●      Collect real-time performance information and optimize the network to maintain the intent of the associated segment routing policy.
●      Tactically optimize the network during times of congestion with bandwidth optimization techniques.
●      Gain the most from migration to next-generation networks and technologies (for example, migration from RSVP-TE to SR-TE, implementing multicast with SR Tree-SID, embracing 5G network slicing, etc.).
●      Monitor and troubleshoot health of L2VPN and L3VPN services by combining empirical data plane verification with infrastructure health to realize true service impact. Service health status visualization can be augmented with infrastructure alarms.
●      Streamlining and automation of network-focused Method of Procedure (MOP) for remediation and maintenance tasks.
Cisco Crosswork Network Controller enables you to realize multiple benefits:
●      Model-based approach helps to expedite provisioning of new services, underlying transport and changes to existing services.
●      Improved service delivery and end-user experience with ability to effectively maintain service intent.
●      Enhanced operational efficiency with unified visibility and simplified operations across service lifecycle functions.
●      Increased profitability and reduced costs through optimized investments and better OpEx utilization.

Product specifications
Cisco Crosswork Network Controller has been shaped by helping large, tier-one service provider and enterprise customers automate everything from simple device turn-up to cross-domain automation to sophisticated full lifecycle service management. Cisco Crosswork Network Controller is built on industry standards enabling multivendor compliance. Cisco Crosswork Network Controller has three areas of touch points into the network:
1.     Provisioning: A model-based programmatic interface (NETCONF/YANG) that allows for control of everything from simple device turn-up and configuration management to sophisticated, full lifecycle service management.
2.     Data collection: A common performance data collection using gNMI (gRPC Network Management Interface), SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), MDT (Model Driven Telemetry), CLI (Command Line Interface), etc.
3.     Network control: Real-time network topology discovery via BGP-LS and network optimization and traffic control using PCEP.
Cisco Crosswork Network Controller provides a standards-based northbound interface to enable integration with external entities (for example, OSS/BSS or higher-level orchestration systems).
