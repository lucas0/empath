Chapter: Cloud OnRamp for Multicloud: Cisco SD-WAN Cloud Interconnect
Chapter Contents
From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.5 and Cisco vManage Release 20.5, you can instantiate a Cisco SD-WAN edge device within the fabric of a Software-Defined Cloud Interconnect (SDCI) provider and connect a branch location to this edge device through the SD-WAN fabric. From this edge device, you can create software-defined interconnects to other Cisco SD-WAN edge devices in the SDCI provider fabric, or to public or private clouds. Thus, the edge devices in the SDCI provider fabric serve as Interconnect Gateways.

The software-defined interconnects link branch locations, or link branch locations to cloud service providers. The interconnects provide dedicated private Layer 2 connectivity with SLA-backed assured performance bandwidth and 99.999% availability. Short haul interconnects link branch locations or a branch location and a cloud onRamp in the same region. Long haul interconnects link branch locations in different regions, or a branch location in one region to a cloud onRamp in another region.
Cisco vManage provides a single UI portal through which you can instantiate the edge device in the SDCI fabric and create the software-defined interconnects.
