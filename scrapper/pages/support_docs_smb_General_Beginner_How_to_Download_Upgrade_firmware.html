Upgrading firmware is essential for optimum performance on every device. It is very important to install upgrades when they are released. When Cisco releases a firmware upgrade, they often contain improvements such as new features or fix a bug that can cause a security vulnerability or a performance issue.

Slow connection
A firmware upgrade can eliminate these problems and help keep your network secure.
