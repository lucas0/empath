About Cisco
Business Continuity
Ensuring employee safety, maintaining operational continuity, and meeting customer expectations
Successful business resiliency ensures employee safety, maintains operational continuity, and meets existing customer obligations through events that would halt an unprepared organization.
Cisco achieves resiliency through three principal areas of focus: business resiliency, incident management, and IT DR. Cisco maintains our readiness by proactively assessing operational risks, establishing contingency plans, and administering incident response training. 
Cisco assesses and mitigates potential business disruptions through our Global Business Resiliency (GBR) Program. Under this program, all corporate business units are required to maintain and exercise alternate operation strategies. The Global Business Resiliency Program office validates that each business unitâ€™s resiliency strategies are effective and meet the global policy requirements established by the program office. For critical business operations, we conduct audits of business continuity plans and moderate annual exercises to ensure their plan efficiently mitigates realistic disruptions.
