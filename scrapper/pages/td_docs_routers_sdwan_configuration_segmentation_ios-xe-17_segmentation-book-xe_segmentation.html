Chapter: Segmentation
Chapter Contents
Network segmentation has existed for over a decade and has been implemented in multiple forms and shapes. At its most rudimentary level, segmentation provides traffic isolation. The most common forms of network segmentation are virtual LANs, or VLANs, for Layer 2 solutions, and virtual routing and forwarding, or VRF, for Layer 3 solutions.
There are many use cases for segmentation:
Use Cases for Segmentation
An enterprise wants to keep different lines of business separate (for example, for security or audit reasons).
The IT department wants to keep authenticated users separate from guest users.
A retail store wants to separate video surveillance traffic from transactional traffic.
An enterprise wants to give business partners selective access only to some portions of the network.
A service or business needs to enforce regulatory compliance, such as compliance with HIPAA, the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) security standards.
A service provider wants to provide VPN services to its medium-sized enterprises.
Limitations of Segmentation
One inherent limitation of segmentation is its scope. Segmentation solutions either are complex or are limited to a single device or pair of devices connected using an interface. As an example, Layer 3 segmentation provides the following:
Ability to group prefixes into a unique route table (RIB or FIB).
Ability to associate an interface with a route table so that traffic traversing the interface is routed based on prefixes in that route table.
This is a useful functionality, but its scope is limited to a single device. To extend the functionality throughout the network, the segmentation information needs to be carried to the relevant points in the network.
How to Enable Network-Wide Segmentation
There are two approaches to providing this network-wide segmentation:
Define the grouping policy at every device and on every link in the network (basically, you perform Steps 1 and 2 above on every device).
Define the grouping policy at the edges of the segment, and then carry the segmentation information in the packets for intermediate nodes to handle.
The first approach is useful if every device is an entry or exit point for the segment, which is generally not the case in medium and large networks. The second approach is much more scalable and keeps the transport network free of segments and complexity.

Segmentation in Cisco SD-WAN
In the Cisco SD-WAN overlay network, VRFs divide the network into different segments.
Cisco SD-WAN employs the more prevalent and scalable model of creating segments. Essentially, segmentation is done at the edges of a router, and the segmentation information is carried in the packets in the form of an identifier.
The figure shows the propagation of routing information inside a VRF.
Figure 1. Propagation of Routing Information Inside a VRF
In this figure:
Router-1 subscribes to two VRFs, red and blue.
The red VRF caters to the prefix 10.1.1.0/24 (either directly through a connected interface or learned using the IGP or BGP).
The blue VRF caters to the prefix 10.2.2.0/24 (either directly through a connected interface or learned using the IGP or BGP).
Router-2 subscribes to the red VRF.
This VRF caters to the prefix 192.168.1.0/24 (either directly through a connected interface or learned using the IGP or BGP).
Router-3 subscribes to the blue VRF.
This VRF caters to the prefix 192.168.2.0/24 (either directly through a connected interface or learned using the IGP or BGP).
Because each router has an Overlay Management Protocol (OMP) connection over a TLS tunnel to a Cisco vSmart Controller, it propagates its routing information to the Cisco vSmart Controller. On the Cisco vSmart Controller, the network administrator can enforce policies to drop routes, to change TLOCs, which are overlay next hops, for traffic engineering or service chaining. A network administrator can apply these policies as inbound and outbound policies on the Cisco vSmart Controller.
All the prefixes belonging to a single VRF are kept in a separate route table. This provides the Layer 3 isolation required for the various segments in the network. So, Router-1 has two VRF route tables, and Router-2 and Router-3 each have one route table. In addition, the Cisco vSmart Controller maintains the VRF context of each prefix.
Separate route tables provide isolation on a single node. So how is routing information propagated across the network?
In the Cisco SD-WAN solution, this is done using VRF identifiers, as shown in the figure below. A VRF ID, which is carried in a packet, identifies each VRF on a link. When you configure a VRF on a router, the VRF has a label associated with it. The router sends the label, along with the VRF ID, to the Cisco vSmart Controller. The Cisco vSmart Controller propagates this router-to- VRF ID mapping information to the other routers in the domain. The remote routers then use this label to send traffic to the appropriate VRF. The local routers, on receiving the data with the VRF ID label, use the label to demultiplex the data traffic. This is similar to how MPLS labels are used. This design is based on standard RFCs and is compliant with regulatory procedures such as PCI and HIPAA.
Figure 2. VRF Identifiers

Note
The transport network that connects the routers is completely unaware of the VRFs. Only the routers know about VRFs; the rest of the network follows standard IP routing.
VRFs Used in Cisco SD-WAN Segmentation
The Cisco SD-WAN solution involves the use of VRFs to separate traffic.
Global VRF
The global VRF is used for transport. To enforce the inherent separation between services (such as prefixes that belong to the enterprise) and transport (the network that connects the routers), all the transport interfaces, that is, all the TLOCs, are kept in the global VRF. This ensures that the transport network cannot reach the service network by default. Multiple transport interfaces can belong to the same VRF, and packets can be forwarded to and from transport interfaces.
A global VRF contains all the interfaces for a device, except the management interface, and all the interfaces are disabled. For the control plane to establish itself so that the overlay network can function, you must configure tunnel interfaces in a global VRF. For each interface in a global VRF, you must set an IP address, and create a tunnel connection that sets the color and encapsulation for the WAN transport connection. (The encapsulation is used for the transmission of data traffic.) These three parameters—IP address, color, and encapsulation—define a TLOC (transport location) on the router. The OMP session running on each tunnel sends the TLOC to the Cisco vSmart Controllers so that they can learn the overlay network topology.
Dual-Stack Support on Transport VPNs
In the global VRF, Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices and vSmart controllers support dual stack. To enable dual stack, configure an IPv4 address and an IPv6 address on the tunnel interface. The router learns from a Cisco vSmart Controller whether a destination supports IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. When forwarding traffic, a router chooses either the IPv4 or the IPv6 TLOC, based on the destination address. But IPv4 is always preferred when configured.
Management VRF
Mgmt-Intf is the management VRF on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. It is configured and enabled by default. It carries out-of-band network management traffic among the devices in the overlay network. You can modify this configuration, if required.
Configure VRF Using Cisco vManage Templates
In Cisco vManage, use a CLI template to configure VRFs for a device. For each VRF, configure a subinterface and link the subinterface to the VRF. You can configure up to 300 VRFs.
When you push a CLI template to a device, Cisco vManage overwrites existing configuration on the device and loads the configuration defined in the CLI template. Consequently, the template cannot only provide the new content being configured, such as VRFs. The CLI template must include all the configuration details required by the device. To display the relevant configuration details on a device, use the show sdwan running-config command.
For details about creating and applying CLI templates, and for an example of configuring VRFs, see the CLI Templates for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Routers chapter of the Systems and Interfaces Configuration Guide, Cisco IOS XE Release 17.x.
The following are the supported devices:
Cisco ASR1001-HX
ASR1002-HX
Configure VPNs Using Cisco vManage Templates
Create a VPN Template

Note
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices use VRFs for segmentation and network isolation. However, the following steps still apply if you are configuring segmentation for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices through Cisco vManage. When you complete the configuration, the system automatically converts the VPNs to VRFs for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.

Note
You can configure a static route through the VPN template.

To save the feature template, click Save.
Configure Load-Balancing Algorithm Using the CLI

Note
Starting from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.8.1a, you need CLI template to configure the src-only load-sharing algorithm for IPv4 and IPv6 SD-WAN and non SD-WAN traffic. For complete details on the load-sharing algorithm CLI, see IP Commands list.
This following provides CLI configurations for selecting a Cisco Express Forwarding load-balancing algorithm for non SD-WAN IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. You can enable ECMP keying to send the configurations for both IPv4 and IPv6.
Device# config-transaction
Device(config)# ip cef load-sharing algorithm {universal [id] | include-ports [ source [id] | destination [id]] |
src-only [id]}
Device# config-transaction
Device(config)# ipv6 cef load-sharing algorithm {universal [id] | include-ports [ source [id] | destination [id]] |
src-only [id]}
This following provides CLI configurations for enabling load balancing algorithm on an interface for SD-WAN IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. You can enable ECMP keying to send the configurations for both IPv4 and IPv6.
Device# config-transaction
Device(config)# sdwan
Device(config-sdwan)# ip load-sharing algorithm {ip-and-ports | src-dst-ip | src-ip-only}
Device# config-transaction
Device(config)# sdwan
Device(config-sdwan)# ipv6 load-sharing algorithm {ip-and-ports | src-dst-ip | src-ip-only}

To save the feature template, click Save.
Create a Tunnel Interface
On Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices, you can configure up to eight tunnel interfaces. This means that each Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device router can have up to eight TLOCs. On Cisco vSmart Controllers and Cisco vManage, you can configure one tunnel interface.
For the control plane to establish itself so that the overlay network can function, you must configure WAN transport interfaces in VPN 0. The WAN interface will enable the flow of tunnel traffic to the overlay. You can add other parameters shown in the table below only after you configure the WAN interface as a tunnel interface.
To configure a tunnel interface, select Interface Tunnel and configure the following parameters:
Parameter Name Description
Tunnel Interface Click On to create a tunnel interface.
Color Select a color for the TLOC.
Port Hop Click On to enable port hopping, or click Off to disable it. If port hopping is enabled globally, you can disable it on an individual TLOC (tunnel interface). To control port hopping on a global level, use the System configuration template.
Default: Enabled
vManage NMS and Cisco vSmart Controller default: Disabled
TCP MSS
TCP MSS affects any packet that contains an initial TCP header that flows through the router. When configured, TCP MSS is examined against the MSS exchanged in the three-way handshake. The MSS in the header is lowered if the configured TCP MSS setting is lower than the MSS in the header. If the MSS header value is already lower than the TCP MSS, the packets flow through unmodified. The host at the end of the tunnel uses the lower setting of the two hosts. If the TCP MSS is to be configured, it should be set at 40 bytes lower than the minimum path MTU.
Specify the MSS of TPC SYN packets passing through the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device. By default, the MSS is dynamically adjusted based on the interface or tunnel MTU such that TCP SYN packets are never fragmented. Range: 552 to 1460 bytes Default: None
Clear-Dont-Fragment
Configure Clear-Dont-Fragment for packets that arrive at an interface that has Don't Fragment configured. If these packets are larger than what MTU allows, they are dropped. If you clear the Don't Fragment bit, the packets are fragmented and sent.
Click On to clear the Dont Fragment bit in the IPv4 packet header for packets being transmitted out of the interface. When the Dont Fragment bit is cleared, packets larger than the MTU of the interface are fragmented before being sent.
Note 
Clear-Dont-Fragment clears the Dont Fragment bit and the Dont Fragment bit is set. For packets not requiring fragmentation, the Dont Fragment bit is not affected.
Allow Service Select On or Off for each service to allow or disallow the service on the interface.
To configure additional tunnel interface parameters, click Advanced Options:
Parameter Name Description
Carrier
Select the carrier name or private network identifier to associate with the tunnel.
Values: carrier1, carrier2, carrier3, carrier4, carrier5, carrier6, carrier7, carrier8, default
Default: default
NAT Refresh Interval Enter the interval between NAT refresh packets sent on a DTLS or TLS WAN transport connection.
Range: 1 through 60 seconds
Default: 5 seconds
Hello Interval
Enter the interval between Hello packets sent on a DTLS or TLS WAN transport connection.
Range: 100 through 10000 milliseconds
Default: 1000 milliseconds (1 second)
Hello Tolerance
Enter the time to wait for a Hello packet on a DTLS or TLS WAN transport connection before declaring that transport tunnel to be down.
Range: 12 through 60 seconds
Default: 12 seconds
Configure DNS and Static Hostname Mapping
To configure DNS addresses and static hostname mapping, click DNS and configure the following parameters:
Parameter Name Options Description
Primary DNS Address Click either IPv4 or IPv6, and enter the IP address of the primary DNS server in this VPN.
New DNS Address Click New DNS Address and enter the IP address of a secondary DNS server in this VPN. This field appears only if you have specified a primary DNS address.
Mark as Optional Row Check the Mark as Optional Row check box to mark this configuration as device-specific. To include this configuration for a device, enter the requested variable values when you attach a device template to a device, or create a template variables spreadsheet to apply the variables.

Configure Segmentation Using the CLI
Configure VRFs Using the CLI
To segment user networks and user data traffic locally at each site and to interconnect user sites across the overlay network, you create VRFs on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. To enable the flow of data traffic, you associate interfaces with each VRF, assigning an IP address to each interface. These interfaces connect to local-site networks, not to WAN transport clouds. For each of these VRFs, you can set other interface-specific properties, and you can configure features specific for the user segment, such as BGP and OSPF routing, VRRP, QoS, traffic shaping, and policing.
On Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices, a global VRF is used for transport. All Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices have Mgmt-intf as the default management VRF.
To configure VRFs on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices, follow these steps.

Note
Use the config-transaction command to open CLI configuration mode. The config terminal command is not supported on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
The VRF ID can be any number between 1 through 511 and 513 through 65535. The numbers 0 and 512 are reserved for Cisco vManage and Cisco vSmart controller.
Configure service VRFs.

Segmentation (VRFs) Configuration Examples
Some straightforward examples of creating and configuring VRFs to help you understand the configuration procedure for segmenting networks.
Configuration on the Cisco vSmart Controller
On the Cisco vSmart Controller, you configure general system parameters and the two VPNs—VPN 0 for WAN transport and VPN 512 for network management—as you did for the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device. Also, you generally create a centralized control policy that controls how the VPN traffic is propagated through the rest of the network. In this particular example, we create a central policy, shown below, to drop unwanted prefixes from propagating through the rest of the network. You can use a single Cisco vSmart Controller policy to enforce policies throughout the network.
Here are the steps for creating the control policy on the Cisco vSmart Controller:
Create a list of sites IDs for the sites where you want to drop unwanted prefixes:
vSmart(config)# policy lists site-list 20-30 site-id 20
vSmart(config-site-list-20-30)# site-id 30
Create a prefix list for the prefixes that you do not want to propagate:
vSmart(config)# policy lists prefix-list drop-list ip-prefix 10.200.1.0/24
Create the control policy:
vSmart(config)# policy control-policy drop-unwanted-routes sequence 10 match route prefix-list drop-list
vSmart(config-match)# top
vSmart(config)# policy control-policy drop-unwanted-routes sequence 10 action reject
vSmart(config-action)# top
vSmart(config)# policy control-policy drop-unwanted-routes sequence 10 default-action accept
vSmart(config-default-action)# top
Apply the policy to prefixes inbound to the Cisco vSmart Controller controller:
vSmart(config)# apply-policy site-list 20-30 control-policy drop-unwanted-routes in
Here is the full policy configuration on the Cisco vSmart Controller controller:
