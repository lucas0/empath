NAT64 DIA for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Release 16.12.1b
Cisco vManage Release 19.2.1
The NAT64 Direct Internet Access (DIA) feature supports routing of traffic from branch sites directly to the internet instead of tunneling the internet traffic to a central site or data center for internet access.
NAT64 DIA allows IPv6 clients from a branch site to access IPv4 enterprise application servers in a data center or locally in the branch. IPv6 clients can also access IPv4 servers from the branch directly using the internet.

Information About NAT64 DIA
NAT64 DIA allows an IPv4 server to access an IPv6 server either from a remote branch or from a data center.
The traffic flow for NAT64 DIA is from the LAN to DIA.
How NAT64 DIA Works
Enable IPv4 and IPv6 using a Cisco VPN Interface Ethernet template.
Configure an IPv6 route in a Cisco VPN template, which is the service-side VPN.
The source and destination IPv6 addresses are translated.
Because NAT IPv4 DIA is configured, the source IPv4 address gets translated because of interface overload. The destination IPv4 address remains the same.
Benefits of NAT64 DIA
Enables good application performance
Contributes to reduced bandwidth consumption and latency
Contributes to lower bandwidth cost
Enables improved branch office user experience by providing DIA at remote site locations
Restrictions for NAT64 DIA
NAT64 DIA uses interface overload only.
NAT DIA pool or loopback is not supported with NAT64.
Restrictions for a NAT64 DIA Route
You can use the following NAT64 DIA routes for installing routes in the routing table:
Example of a NAT64 DIA route for a /128 prefix:
nat64 route vrf 4 64:FF9B::1E00:102/128 global
Example of a NAT64 DIA route for a /96 prefix:
nat64 route vrf 4 64:FF9B::/96 global
You cannot use the following NAT64 DIA route configurations for installing routes in the routing table:
nat64 route vrf 4 64:ff9b::/64 global
nat64 route vrf 4 ::0/0 global
Configure NAT64 DIA and a DIA Route
Workflow for Enabling NAT64 DIA
Enable NAT64 using a Cisco VPN Interface Ethernet template for both IPv4 and IPv6.

Note
NAT64 IPv4 DIA uses interface overload by default.
When configuring NAT64 for IPv6 DIA, interface overload is already configured.
A Cisco VPN Interface Ethernet template is a transport interface.

Advertise NAT64 Routes Through OMP
When NAT64 DIA advertisement is configured on any designated Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device on the network, OMP advertises the NAT default route to the branches. The branches receive the default route and use it to reach the hub for all DIA traffic. The Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device acts as the internet gateway for all DIA traffic.

Note
By default, NAT64 IPv4 pool addresses and the NAT64 well-known prefix are received as an OMP route.

Service-Side NAT64 for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Release 16.12.1b
Cisco vManage Release 19.2.1
The service-side Network Address Translation (NAT) 64 feature translates a source IPv6 address to available IPv4 addresses in a NAT pool. The destination IPv6 address is translated to the server’s actual IPv4 address since the destination IPv6 address is an IPv4 embedded IPv6 address.
Service-side NAT64 allows IPv4 servers to communicate with IPv6 clients.

Information About Service-Side NAT64
With the dwindling IPv4 public address space and the growing need for more routable addresses, service providers and enterprises continue to build and roll out IPv6 networks. As the IPv4 internet is going to stay for a while, communication between IPv4 and IPv6 networks is an important requirement for a seamless end-user experience.
NAT IPv6 to IPv4, or NAT64, technology facilitates communication between IPv6 and IPv4 networks.
The service-side NAT64 feature translates a source IPv6 address to available IPv4 addresses in a NAT pool. The destination IPv6 address is translated to the server’s actual IPv4 address since the destination IPv6 address is an IPv4-embedded IPv6 address.
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices use stateful NAT64 for translating IPv6 addresses to IPv4 addresses and IPv4 addresses to IPv6 addresses. Stateful NAT64 with NAT overload provides a 1:n mapping between IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
How Service-Side NAT64 Works
Benefits of Service-Side NAT64
Use Cases for Service-Side NAT64
How Service-Side NAT64 Works
An IPv6 client attempts to connect to an IPv4 server.
The IPv6 client makes an IPv6 AAAA record DNS query, which is an IPv6 query for an IPv4 address.
The DNS64 server responds with an IPv4-embedded IPv6 address.
Example:
64:ff9b::c000:0201
which uses the NAT64 well-known prefix (WKP), 64:FF9B::/96. The WKP is used for algorithmic mapping between address families.
An IPv4-embedded IPv6 address consists of a variable length prefix, an embedded IPv4 address, and a variable length suffix. The last 32 bits are the hexadecimal representation of the original IPv4 address, which is 192.0.2.1 in this example.
The IPv6 client now tries to connect to the IPv4 server.
An IPv6 to IPv4 translation is performed.
A source IPv6 address is translated to one of the available IPv4 addresses in the pool.
A destination IPv6 address is translated to the server's actual IPv4 address since the destination IPv6 address is an IPv4-embedded IPv6 address.
Benefits of Service-Side NAT64
Supports communication between IPv6 clients in the service VPN with IPv4 servers on the internet
Provides translation of IPv6 to IPv4 addresses for maintaining dual access to IPv6 and IPv4 networks
Requires little or no changes to existing IPv4 network infrastructures when using stateful NAT64
Provides a seamless internet experience for IPv6 users accessing IPv4 internet services, thus maintaining IPv4 business continuity
Supports configuration of NAT64 without having to configure a data policy
Use Cases for Service-Side NAT64
Supported traffic flow is from the IPv6 client on the remote site, in the data center, or in another branch site, to the IPv4 client or server on the local LAN.

Note
Traffic origination is always from the transport-side (WAN) to the service-side (LAN) in the overlay network.
Prerequisites for Service-Side NAT64
For Domain Name System (DNS) traffic to work, you must have a separate working installation of DNS64.
Restrictions for Service-Side NAT64
Traffic must always originate on the remote branch site and go to the IPv4 server on the local LAN.
Traffic cannot originate from the IPv4 server to any IPv6 client in the data center or to a remote branch site.
IPv4 Address Restrictions for Service-Side NAT64
For more information on the usable IPv4 destination IP addresses, see the Deployment Guidelines, RFC 6052, Section 3.1.
The well-known prefix (WKP) must not be used to represent non-global IPv4 addresses, such as those listed in the Deployment Guidelines, Section 3 of RFC 5735.
For example, the following IPv4 prefixes are not allowed:
0.0.0.0/8
10.0.0.0/8
127.0.0.0/8
169.254.0.0/16
You cannot use a private IPv4 address range on the service-side (LAN).

Description
Mapping of Address and Port Using Encapsulation (MAP-E) with NAT64
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10.1a
This feature provides support for an IPv4 client to access IPv4 servers when using an IPv6-only network. IPv4 traffic is routed to the internet over an IPv6 tunnel.
With this feature, you can configure a MAP-E domain and MAP-E parameters for transporting IPv4 packets over an IPv6 network using IP encapsulation. When the MAP-E customer edge (CE) device starts or when an IPv4 address changes, the device obtains the MAP-E parameters automatically from the MAP-E rule server using HTTP.

Information About MAP-E with NAT64
Minimum supported release: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10.1a
Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP-E) is an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) draft that describes a mechanism for transporting IPV4 packets over an IPv6-only network using encapsulation.
Within the MAP-E domain, IPv4 packets are exchanged between MAP-E CE devices and the public IPv4 internet by encapsulating and transporting the packets through the IPv6-only network.
The MAP-E with NAT64 feature supports the following configurations:
Shared-IPv4 configuration
MAP-E enables multiple MAP-E CE devices within a MAP-E domain to share a single IPv4 address. Each MAP-E CE device with the same IPv4 address has to use a different TCP or UDP port. MAP-E provides IPv4 connectivity using shared IPv4 addresses in an IPv6-only network.
Fixed-IPv4 configuration
In a fixed-IPv4 configuration, one MAP-E CE device uses a fixed-IPv4 address.

Benefits of MAP-E with NAT64
Components of a MAP-E Configuration with NAT64
Minimum supported release: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10.1a
Each mapping of address and port using a MAP-E domain uses a different mapping rule. A MAP-E configuration contains the following:
Basic mapping rule (BMR)
A BMR configures the MAP-E IPv6 address or prefix. You can configure only one BMR per IPv6 prefix. The MAP-E CE device uses the BMR to configure itself with an IPv4 address, an IPv4 prefix, or a shared IPv4 address from an IPv6 prefix. You can also use a BMR for forwarding packets in use cases where an IPv4 source address and source port are mapped to an IPv6 address or prefix. Every MAP-E CE must be provisioned with a BMR.
The BMR IPv6 prefix along with the port parameter is used as a tunnel source address.
One default mapping rule (DMR)
A DMR prefix that matches with the interface address is recognized as a host and a DMR prefix with a prefix length of 128 is recognized as the tunnel source address. A border router IPv6 address is the tunnel destination address.
Port-set ID (PSID)
The PSID identifies the allowed ports to use.
The border router checks whether the PSID and the port set match. If the port-set ID and port set match, the DMR matches the packet destination of the IPv6 packet. Based on the BMR, the border router constructs the IPv4 source address and extracts the IPv4 destination address from the IPv6 destination address. The IPv6 packet uses the NAT64 IPv6-to-IPv4 translation engine to construct the IPv4 packet from the IPv6 packet.
Configure the MAP-E parameters automatically from the MAP-E rule server using HTTP when the MAP-E CE device starts or whenever an IPv6 address changes.
To configure a MAP-E domain and MAP-E parameters, use the nat64 provisioning command. For more information on configuring a MAP-E domain and MAP-E parameters, see the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Qualified Command Reference Guide.
For information on the MAP-E rule REST API specifications, see the IP Addressing: NAT Configuration Guide.
Benefits of MAP-E with NAT64
Supports IPv4 traffic flow over an IPv6-only network.
Supports efficient traffic delivery with lower latency without requiring additional hardware at the border router.
Supports an easy-to-use and scalable solution for migrating to IPv6.
Restrictions for MAP-E with NAT64
Minimum supported release: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10.1a
Support for a single BMR per a MAP-E CE device. Configure different mapping rules for every address and port translation.
No support for a BMR prefix length of 64, fragmentation, and local packet generation.

The following diagram describes the end-to-end client traffic flow for an IPv4 client to reach an IPv4 server when using an IPv6-only network with MAP-E.
Figure 2. Workflow for MAP-E with NAT64
MAP-E Interactions Between a MAP-E CE Device and a MAP-E Rule Server
The MAP-E rule server acquires an IPv6 prefix from an IPv6-only network.
A MAP-E CE device sends an HTTP request to the MAP-E rule server and receives a response.
MAP-E enables a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device to function as a MAP-E CE device.
Per the MAP-E rule, a MAP-E CE device performs a translation of the incoming IPv4 packets.
The MAP-E CE device encapsulates the IPv4 packets into IPv6 packets and sends the IPv6 packets to the border router.
On receiving the encoded IPv6 packets, the IPv6 packets are decapsulated by the border router according to the MAP-E rule, and the IPv6 traffic is routed to the IPv4 public internet.

Configure MAP-E with NAT64 Using a CLI Template
Minimum supported release: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10.1a
For more information about using CLI templates, see CLI Add-On Feature Templates and CLI Templates.

Note
By default, CLI templates execute commands in global config mode.
This section provides example CLI configurations to configure a MAP-E domain and MAP-E parameters.
Disable the NAT64 fragmentation header.
nat64 settings fragmentation header disable
Configure a NAT64 DIA route.
nat64 route ip-address interface-type-number
For more information, see Configure a NAT64 DIA Route.
Specify the NAT64 MAP-E domain and enter MAP-E configuration mode.
nat64 provisioning mode jp01
Configure the address resolution sever with a username and password.
address-resolution-server http://ipv6-prefix/directory-path
address-resolution-server 6 username encypted-user-name
address-resolution-server 6 password encypted-password
You can also specify an encryption type (2 or 6) for encrypting the address resolution server username and password.
Configure a MAP-E rule server.
rule-server http://admin:admin@ipv6-prefix//directory-path
You can also specify an encryption type (2 or 6) for encrypting the rule server URL.
(Optional) Configure a wait time in seconds for responses from the HTTP server.
rule-server request wait-time value-seconds
Configure a host name.
hostname hostname
The host name is from the MAP-E rule server. In case you overwrite the host name, you can specify a new host name.
Configure a tunnel interface.
tunnel interface Tunnelnumber
tunnel source interface-type-interface-number

Note
Configure a tunnel interface and a tunnel source for a fixed-IPv4 configuration only.
Configure a service prefix.
service-prefix ipv6-prefix

Note
The IPv6 prefix of the MAP-E rule returned from the MAP-E rule server needs to match the IPv6 service prefix configured on the MAP-E CE device.

Note
Configure a service prefix for either a fixed-IPv4 configuration or for a shared-IPv4 configuration.
Here is a complete configuration example for configuring a MAP-E domain and parameters.

Verify MAP-E with NAT64 Configuration
Minimum supported release: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10.1a
The following example is a sample output from the show nat64 map-e command:
Device# show nat64 map-e
MAP-E Domain 9126
   Mode MAP
   Border-relay-address
      Ip-v6-address 2001:DB8::9
   Basic-mapping-rule
      Ip-v6-prefix 2001:DB8:B001:80::/60
      Ip-v4-prefix 10.1.1.0/24
      Port-parameters
         Share-ratio 4   Contiguous-ports 256   Start-port 1024
         Share-ratio-bits 2   Contiguous-ports-bits 8   Port-offset-bits 6
      Port-set-id 0
The output above is an example of a shared-IPv4 address configuration because the ports are shared across the MAP-E CE devices. The output displays the MAP-E parameters that were returned from the MAP-E rule server.
The following example is a sample output from the show nat64 statistics command:
Device# show nat64 statistics
