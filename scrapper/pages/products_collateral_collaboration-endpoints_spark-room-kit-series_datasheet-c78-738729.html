    Above: Webex Room Kit in small room scenario
Webex Room Kit is a powerful collaboration solution that integrates with flat panel displays to bring more intelligence and usability to your small to medium-sized meeting rooms—whether registered on the premises or to Webex in the cloud.
Webex Room Kit overview
Webex® Room Kit delivers the unmatched video and audio experience customers have come to expect from Cisco. In addition, new capabilities enable even smarter meetings, smarter presentation capabilities, and smarter room and device integrations—further removing the barriers to usage and deployment of video in small to medium-sized rooms.
The Room Kit—which includes camera, codec, speakers, and microphones integrated in a single device—is ideal for rooms that seat up to seven people. It offers sophisticated camera technologies that bring speaker-tracking capabilities to smaller rooms. The product is rich in functionality and experience but is priced and designed to be easily scalable to all of your small conference rooms and spaces—whether registered on the premises or to the Webex cloud service.

Bringing more intelligence to small and medium-sized rooms
The Webex Room Kit offers video innovation in a box, bringing more intelligence and usability to your small to medium team collaboration rooms.

With the Room Kit, Cisco is helping customers experience smarter meetings, enable smarter presentations, and create smarter room and device integrations.
These features were previously the domain of higher-end video conferencing rooms, but can now be brought to every room and every team.
And when registered to Webex, additional cloud-based functionalities are enabled that enhance the user experience and team workflow as well as further simplifying deployment.
