CSCvx00476 QuoVadis root CA decommission on all
Problem Description
For affected versions of the Cisco IOS® XR products, some Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificates issued from the QuoVadis root certificate authority (CA) trust chain before March 31, 2021 cannot be renewed from this CA. Once those certificates expire on devices or are removed from the Cisco cloud servers, functions such as Smart Licensing and Smart Call Home will fail to establish secure connections to Cisco and might not operate properly.
Background
The QuoVadis Root CA 2 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) used by Cisco IOS XR products to issue SSL certificates is subject to an industry-wide issue that affects revocation abilities. Due to this issue, no new QuoVadis Root CA 2 certificates will be issued or renewed by Cisco after March 31, 2021. This affects certificate renewals on devices, Cisco cloud servers, and third-party services.
Certificates issued before the QuoVadis Root CA 2 was decommissioned will continue to be valid. However, the certificates will not renew when they expire on either the device or the Cisco cloud server. This will cause functions such as Smart Licensing and Smart Call Home to fail to establish secure connections to Cisco cloud servers.
This table shows a summary of the QuoVadis Root CA 2 certificate expiration dates for affected Cisco services.

Problem Symptom
Expiration of the QuoVadis Root CA 2 certificates affects these services with the associated symptoms.
Affected Services Symptoms for Affected Services
Smart Licensing Failure to connect to the server (Details are provided in this section)
Smart Call Home Failure to connect to the server and the Call-Home HTTP request fails
  For Cisco IOS XR software, affected devices will be unable to connect to the Smart Licensing and Smart Call Home services hosted by Cisco. Smart licenses might fail entitlement and reflect an Out of Compliance status.
The features that use Smart Licensing will continue to function for up to one year after the last successful secure connection.
Some Smart Licensing symptoms are:
The device might indicate a failure to communicate with the Smart Licensing server within 30 days from the last successful connection.
The device will show the "Authorization Expired" state if there is no communication with the Smart Licensing server within 90 days.
The device will show the "Unregistered" state if there is no communication with the Smart Licensing server after one year and the licensed features usage become suspended.
Smart Licensing Probable Symptoms
If Smart License registration fails, these syslog messages will be seen:
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:Feb 22 10:00:07.962 UTC: smartlicserver[127]: %LICENSE-SMART_LIC-3-COMM_FAILED : Communications failure with the Cisco Smart Software Manager (CSSM) : Fail to send out Call Home HTTP message
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:Feb 22 10:00:07.962 UTC: smartlicserver[127]: %LICENSE-SMART_LIC-3-AGENT_REG_FAILED : Smart Agent for Licensing Registration with the Cisco Smart Software Manager (CSSM) failed: Fail to send out Call Home HTTP message
Smart Call Home Symptoms
This error log might be observed in the affected device:
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:Feb 22 09:57:36.246 UTC: http_client[255]: %SECURITY-XR_SSL-3-CERT_VERIFY_ERR_2_PARAM : SSL certificate verify error: Peer certificate verification failed - no trusted cert 'Crypto Engine' detected the 'warning' condition 'Invalid trustpoint or trustpoint not exist'
If the download fails, this message might be seen:
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:Feb 22 09:57:24.025 UTC: cepki[279]: %SECURITY-PKI-6-ERR_1_PARAM : Download failed, HTTP returned an error
Note: Offline licensing, such as Permanent License Reservation (PLR) and Specific License Reservation (SLR), is not affected by the certificate change on the Smart Licensing server.
For additional information, refer to the Cisco Smart Licensing Guide and the Cisco IOS XR Platform Guide for your specific version of Cisco IOS XR software.

Workaround/Solution
Cisco has migrated from the QuoVadis Root CA 2 to the IdenTrust Commercial Root CA 1 for SSL certificates. Cisco recommends a manual certificate update to add the new IdenTrust Commercial Root CA 1 certificate to the Cisco IOS XR products.
Manual Certificate Update
In order to check the built-in and downloaded certificates installed on your device, enter the show crypto ca trustpool command.
Example:
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#show crypto ca trustpool

  Manual Certificate Update Options
The three options for a manual certificate update are described in this section.
Option 1. Download a Bundle of Certificates From the Default Location
The bundle of certificates can be downloaded from http://www.cisco.com/security/pki/trs/ios.p7b by default. If a device is not able to resolve the domain name, it will not download the pool of certificates. This bundle of certificates has the Smart Licensing root certificates.
Initiate the download with this command:
crypto ca trustpool import url http://www.cisco.com/security/pki/trs/ios.p7b
  Option 2. Download the Bundle of Certificates by Hosting it Locally
Cisco IOS XR devices support trustpool policy configuration which allows you to change the default CA Bundle URL. This configuration command can be used to change the CA bundle policy.
crypto ca trustpool policy
    cabundle url <local customer defined url>
Download the CA bundle file from the default location in order to host it locally in an HTTP server. This can be leveraged in case of a connectivity issue.
Enter this command in order to display the trustpool policy:
show crypto ca trustpool policy
  Option 3. File-Based Download
Customers who are not able to authenticate the certificate with options 1 or 2 can use the file-based approach. Download the file from the default URL (http://www.cisco.com/security/pki/trs/ios.p7b) and copy it to the "tmp" directory. You can then enter this command to authenticate the CA certificates to the device.
crypto ca trustpool import url /tmp/pki_bundle_0.p7b
Note: Cisco IOS XR does not support customer-signed CA bundle of certificates. It must be signed by the Cisco M1 root certificate, and it is managed by the Cisco Information Security team.
Enter this command for authorization:
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#license smart renew auth
Check the license status:
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#show license status
