CSCvy69076 Upgrade of virtual SMA fails due to small partition size
Problem Description
An attempt to upgrade a Virtual Email Security Apppliance (vESA) or Virtual Security Management Appliance (vSMA) with a nextroot partition size less than 500MB fails.
Background
Initially, vESA and vSMA images were built with a nextroot partition size of less than 500MB. Over the years, and with later AsyncOS releases that include additional features, upgrades have had to use more and more of this partition throughout the upgrade process. This results in upgrades that fail because of this partition size.
This issue is known to affect upgrades to AsyncOS Version 14.x, 15.x, and later for both ESA and SMA appliances.
Problem Symptom
An older vESA or vSMA image with a nextroot partition size of less than 500MB might fail to upgrade with these errors:

For AsyncOS Version 15.x and later, if the next partition is less than 4GB, the upgrade will be aborted, and this message will be printed in the console.
Your system upgrade to AsyncOS 15.0 version is blocked because the machine has a next root partition of less than 4GB disk space. You must deploy a new virtual appliance with a next root partition of 4 GB disk space. For more information on how to deploy a new virtual appliance with a next root partition of 4 GB disk space, see the Field Notice (FN) at https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/field-notices/722/fn72230.html.
Workaround/Solution
In order to ensure your vESA/vSMA can be upgraded, you need to first check if the nextroot partition size is 4GB with the ipcheck CLI command.

If the nextroot partition is less than 4GB, see How to Apply the Workaround for Cisco vESA/vSMA Failing Upgrade Due to Small Partition Size in order to migrate your current VM template to a later updated image.
