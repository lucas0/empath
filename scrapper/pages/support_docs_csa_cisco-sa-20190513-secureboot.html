Summary
A vulnerability in the logic that handles access control to one of the hardware components in Cisco's proprietary Secure Boot implementation could allow an authenticated, local attacker to write a modified firmware image to the component. This vulnerability affects multiple Cisco products that support hardware-based Secure Boot functionality.
The vulnerability is due to an improper check on the area of code that manages on-premise updates to a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) part of the Secure Boot hardware implementation. An attacker with elevated privileges and access to the underlying operating system that is running on the affected device could exploit this vulnerability by writing a modified firmware image to the FPGA. A successful exploit could either cause the device to become unusable (and require a hardware replacement) or allow tampering with the Secure Boot verification process, which under some circumstances may allow the attacker to install and boot a malicious software image.
Cisco will release software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
Cisco has investigated all Cisco products that support hardware-based Secure Boot functionality to verify that they are enforcing the appropriate access control checks.
Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.
No other Cisco products that support hardware-based Secure Boot functionality are vulnerable.
Details
An attacker will need to fulfill all the following conditions to attempt to exploit this vulnerability:
Have privileged administrative access to the device.
Be able to access the underlying operating system running on the device; this can be achieved either by using a supported, documented mechanism or by exploiting another vulnerability that would provide an attacker with such access.
Develop or have access to a platform-specific exploit. An attacker attempting to exploit this vulnerability across multiple affected platforms would need to research each one of those platforms and then develop a platform-specific exploit. Although the research process could be reused across different platforms, an exploit developed for a given hardware platform is unlikely to work on a different hardware platform.
Cisco is in the process of developing and releasing software fixes for all affected platforms. In most cases, the fix will require an on-premise reprogramming of a low-level hardware component that is required for normal device operation. A failure during this reprogramming process may cause the device to become unusable and require a hardware replacement. Customers are advised to consult the Release Note Enclosure for the Cisco bug relevant to their platform for the following information:
Causes that could lead to a failure of the reprogramming process and cause the device to become unusable
A platform-specific set of steps that are required to reprogram a device
The procedure required to determine whether a given device is running an affected firmware version (that therefore must be fixed) or whether the device is already running a fixed firmware version
The product release notes that are published with each platform-specific fixed software release will include more detailed information about items 2 and 3 in the preceding list. The product release notes should be considered the most up-to-date source of information about these items.
For details about Secure Boot and related Trustworthy Technologies, please refer to the Trustworthy Technologies Datasheet. A list of all Cisco products supporting secure boot technology can be found at the following link: https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/trust-center/docs/cisco-secure-boot-product-list.pdf
Workarounds
There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
Cisco Guide to Harden Cisco IOS Devices provides information about how to harden the device and secure management access. Implementing the recommendations in this document would reduce the attack surface for this vulnerability.
Fixed Software
For information about fixed software releases, consult the Cisco bugs identified in the Vulnerable Products section of this advisory.
Cisco will release free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html
Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.
When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page, to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.
In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html
Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
Exploitation and Public Announcements
This vulnerability was publicly disclosed by Red Balloon Security on May 13, 2019.
The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is aware of the existence of proof-of-concept code that demonstrates this vulnerability on the Cisco ASR 1001-X. There are no indications at this time that this proof-of-concept code is publicly available.
Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.
