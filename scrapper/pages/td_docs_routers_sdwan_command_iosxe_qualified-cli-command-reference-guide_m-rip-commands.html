neighbor (RIP)
To define a neighboring router for exchanging routing information, use the neighbor command in router configuration mode. To remove a neighboring router entry, use the no form of this command.
neighbor ip-address [bfd]
no neighbor ip-address [bfd]
Syntax Description
ip-address
IP address of a peer router with which the routing information is exchanged.
bfd

Usage Guidelines
For usage guidelines, see the Cisco IOS XE neighbor (RIP) command.
The following example shows how RIP updates are sent to all the interfaces on network 10.0.0.0 except GigabitEthernet interface 1/0/1. However, in this case, a neighbor router configuration command is included. The neighbor command permits the sending of routing updates to specific neighbors. One copy of the routing update is generated for each neighbor.

timers basic (RIP)
To adjust the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) network timers, use the timers basic command in router configuration mode. To reset the default timers, use the no form of this command.
timers basic update invalid holddown flush
no timers basic
Syntax Description
update
Rate, in seconds, at which updates are sent. This is the fundamental timing parameter of the routing protocol. The default is 30 seconds.
invalid
Interval of time, in seconds, after which a route is declared invalid; it should be at least three times the value of the update argument. A route becomes invalid when there is an absence of updates that refresh the route. The route then enters into a holddown state. The route is marked inaccessible and advertised as unreachable. However, the route is still used for forwarding packets. The default is 180 seconds.
holddown
Interval, in seconds, during which routing information regarding better paths is suppressed. It should be at least three times the value of the update argument. A route enters into a holddown state when an update packet, which indicates that the route is unreachable is received. The route is marked inaccessible and advertised as unreachable. However, the route is still used for forwarding packets. When holddown expires, routes advertised by other sources are accepted and the route is no longer inaccessible. The default is 180 seconds.
flush
Amount of time, in seconds, that must pass before the route is removed from the routing table; the interval specified should be greater than the value of the invalid argument. If it is less than this sum, the proper holddown interval cannot elapse, which results in a new route being accepted before the holddown interval expires. The default is 240 seconds.
Command Default
No RIP network timers are adjusted.
Command Modes
Router configuration (config-router)
Command History
Release
Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.1a
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
For usage guidelines, see the Cisco IOS XE timers basic (RIP) command.
The following example sets updates to be broadcast every 5 seconds. If a router does not respond within 15 seconds, the router is declared as unusable. Further information is suppressed for an additional 15 seconds, after which the route is flushed from the routing table:
router rip
!  
  timers basic 5  15  15  30
!

Note
By setting a short update period, you run the risk of congesting slow-speed serial lines. A short update period can be a concern on faster-speed Ethernets and T1-rate serial lines. Also, if you have many routes in your updates, you can cause the routers to spend an excessive amount of time processing updates.
The following example shows how to adjust address family timers:
router rip
