Information About Reports
Reports are comprehensive datasets from a specific time period. A report can be a single page or multiple pages long, including different visualizations. Reports allow you to get a deeper understanding of data and identify causes. You can generate a report in Cisco vManage and utilize the data to understand the health of sites, devices, and tunnels. This feature provides flexible scheduling options, and generates the data in several formats, including heat maps, pie charts, and bar charts.
Restrictions for Reports
This feature is available in both single-tenant and multitenant deployments. However, in multitenant deployments, this feature is available only for the tenant dashboard.
