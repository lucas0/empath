Introduction
The article describes the process of upgrading a license from a single to triple data encryption standard/advanced encryption standard (3DES/AES) for Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA). A 3DES/AES license, otherwise known as a K9 license, is required for strong encryption. If you do not have a K9 license, decryption processing with a server that requires strong encryption fails. Any flow that requires decryption that the device cannot perform is denied regardless of access policies. Although the K9 license is free, its availability is limited by export restrictions.
Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure that:
You have the following data at your disposal:
Active Cisco.com account
ASA serial number (from chassis or printed circuit board (PCB) - also known as motherboard)

Step 3:
From the Get Licenses drop-down list, select IPS, Crypto, other.
Step result: The system displays the Request Crypto, IPS and Other Licenses dialog box.
Step 4:
