This document provides information about Cisco Crosswork Network Controller 5.0.x, including product overview, solution components, new features and functionality, compatibility information, and known issues and limitations.
Overview
Cisco Crosswork Network Controller empowers customers to simplify and automate intent-based network service provisioning, monitoring and optimization in a multi-vendor network environment with a common GUI and API.
The solution combines intent-based network automation to deliver critical capabilities for service orchestration and fulfillment, network optimization, service path computation, device deployment and management, and anomaly detection with the option for automated remediation. Using telemetry gathering and automated responses, Cisco Crosswork Network Controller delivers network optimization capabilities that would be nearly impossible to replicate even with a highly skilled and dedicated staff operating the network.
The fully integrated solution combines core capabilities from multiple innovative, industry-leading products including Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (NSO), Cisco Segment Routing Path Computation Element (SR-PCE), Cisco WAN Automation Engine (WAE), Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway, and an evolving suite of applications operating on the Cisco Crosswork Infrastructure. Its unified user interface allows real-time visualization of the network topology and services, as well as service and transport provisioning, via a single pane of glass. While its feature-rich API allows operators to seamlessly integrate the solution with other applications they use to operate, monitor, and provision services on the network.
Primary Use Cases:
Orchestrated service provisioning: Provisioning of layer 2 VPN (L2VPN) and layer 3 VPN (L3VPN) services with underlay transport policies to define, meet, and maintain service-level agreements (SLA), using the UI or APIs. Using Segment Routing Flexible Algorithm (Flex-Algo) provisioning and visualizing to customize and compute IGP shortest paths over a network according to specified constraints.
Real-time network and bandwidth optimization: Intent-based closed-loop automation, congestion mitigation, and dynamic bandwidth management based on Segment Routing and RSVP-TE. Optimization of bandwidth resource utilization by setting utilization thresholds on links and calculating tactical alternate paths when thresholds are exceeded.
Ability to provision Circuit Style Segment Routing Traffic Engineering (CS SR-TE) policies and visualize them in your network topology provides:
Straightforward verification of CS SR-TE policy configurations
Visualization of CS SR-TE details, bi-directional active and candidate paths
Operational status details
Failover behavior monitoring for individual CS SR-TE policies
A percentage of bandwidth reservation for each link in the network
Manually triggered recalculations of existing CS SR-TE policy paths that may no longer be optimized due to network topology changes
Local Congestion Management: Local Congestion Mitigation (LCM) provides localized mitigation recommendations within surrounding interfaces, with the use of standard protocols. Data is gathered in real-time and when congestion is detected, solutions are suggested. LCM has a “human-in-the-loop” aspect which ensures that the control of making changes in the network is in the hands of the operator.
Visualization of network and service topology and inventory: Visibility into device and service inventory and visualization of devices, links, and transport or VPN services and their health status on maps with logical or geographical contexts.
Performance-based closed-loop automation: Automated discovery and remediation of problems in the network by allowing Key Performance Indicator (KPI) customization and monitoring of pre-defined remediation tasks when a KPI threshold is breached. For this use case, Cisco Crosswork Health Insights and Cisco Crosswork Change Automation must be installed.
Planning, scheduling, and automating network maintenance tasks: Scheduling an appropriate maintenance window for a maintenance task after evaluating the potential impact of the task (using WAE Design). Automating the execution of maintenance tasks (such as throughput checks, software upgrades, SMU installs) using playbooks. For this use case, Cisco Crosswork Health Insights and Change Automation must be installed.
Secure zero-touch provisioning (ZTP) and onboarding of devices: Onboarding new IOS-XR devices and automatically provisioning Day0 configuration resulting in faster deployment of new hardware at lower operating costs. For this use case, Cisco Crosswork Zero Touch Provisioning must be installed.
Visualization of native SR paths: Visualizing the native path using the traceroute SR-MPLS multipath command to get the actual paths between the source and the destination can be achieved using Path Query. With Cisco Crosswork Network Controller, a traceroute command runs on the source device for the destination TE-Router ID and assists in retrieving the paths.
Provision, Visualize, and Analyze Tree Segment Identifier Policies in Multipath Networks: Creating and visualizing static Tree-SID policies using the UI. Static mVPN Tree-SID policies associated with existing, or newly created, L3VPN service models (SR MPLS point-to-multi-point) using the Crosswork Network Controller can be visualized and analyzed to assist in efficient management and troubleshooting of your multicast network.

What's New
The table below lists the primary new features and functionality introduced in Cisco Crosswork Network Controller 5.0.x.
Table 5. New Features and Functionality in Cisco Crosswork Network Controller 5.0.x
Feature
What's New?
Circuit Style Segment Routing Traffic Engineering (CS SR-TE)
The CS SR-TE feature pack provides a bandwidth-aware Path Computation Element (PCE) to compute CS SR policy paths that you can visualize in your network. CS SR policies guarantee allocated bandwidth services with predictable latency and persistent bidirectional path protection of critical traffic. Unlike Bandwidth on Demand, where SR policies with requested bandwidth are created on a best effort basis, CS SR-TE reserves a percentage of bandwidth in the network and computes CS SR policy bidirectional failover paths with the requested bandwidth. CS SR-TE also maintains the accounting of all CS SR reserved bandwidth in the network. CS SR policies are typically used for high priority services, such as crucial monetary transactions or important live video feed, which require committed bandwidth with fast and fail-safe connections.
Crosswork Network Controller enables you to provision CS SR-TE policy configurations and easily edit policies, as needed. In addition, the ability to visualize CS SR policies in your network topology allows you to easily verify CS SR policy configurations, details, and path states. With a few clicks you can view Active and Protective paths, operational status, reserved bandwidth pool size, and monitor path failover behavior for individual CS SR policies.
Tree Segment Identifier (Tree-SID) policy provisioning and L3VPN service model association
Tree-SID is used to implement multicast trees in segment routed transport networks. Using Crosswork Network Controller, the provisioning of static Tree-SID policies and the visualization of policies are rendered using the UI. Dynamic Tree-SID policies may be created directly on a device using an API. In addition, using Crosswork Network Controller, the ability to associate static Tree-SID policies with existing or newly created L3VPN service models is now available.
Static mVPN Tree-SID policies associated with existing, or newly created, L3VPN service models (SR MPLS point-to-multipoint) using the Crosswork Network Controller that can also be visualized and analyzed to assist in efficient management and troubleshooting of your multicast network.
Note
  Dynamic Tree-SID policies can be visualized using the Traffic Engineering page. However, there will be no mapping on the Transport tab if it is attached to an L3 point-to-multipoint VPN service.
Configuring link affinities used to specify the link attributes that determine which links are suitable to form a path for the Tree-SID policy and maps each bit position or attribute with a color (making it easier to refer to specific link attributes).
Modifying existing static Tree-SID policies and mVPN Tree-SID policies associated with an L3VPN service model – both edit and delete – using the UI.
Crosswork UI Improvements
Traffic Engineering Dashboard, which includes the TE Dashlet that provides:
A high-level summary of RSVP-TE tunnel, SR-MPLS, SRv6, and Tree-SID policy information (total policy count, policy state, metric types for all TE services, and specific data that is filtered upon a one-click selection).
Policies and Tunnels under traffic threshold for historical data by displaying RSVP-TE tunnels and SR-MPLS policies that have traffic below the defined threshold in the selected time period. This information may be used to find and filter the unused policies or tunnels.
Filtering the data on the dashlet based on the time range you want to view (date, 1 month, 1 week, 1 day, and 1 hour).
Policy and Tunnel Change Events: Displays all the policies and tunnels that have had a path or state change event ordered by the event count, within the selected time range. This information helps identify the unstable policies and tunnels.
Traffic Engineering event and historical data information associated with a device when viewing details for a policy or tunnel. For example, the traffic rate and event history for an SR-MPLS policy can be viewed by selecting the Historical Data tab and clicking on an event. By doing so, you can view the state of the policy or tunnel at that point in time and view additional details, such as Admin and Operational state, Segment type, accumulated metric, delegated PCE, and more so to drill down on the event details.
Enable/Disable Alarm Status Badge slider: The system allows you to enable or disable the Alarm Status Badge slider for devices and links across various topology views. Using the Alarm Status Badge, you can better focus the overlay on an area of interest when troubleshooting.
Configuration of the Traffic Engineering Data Dashboard Settings (and historical data) for the collection of policy and tunnel metrics, state and path changes, data retention intervals, and the utilization threshold for underutilized LSPs.
Global search in UI topology: You can now search within the Crosswork Network Controller topology map in the UI. This feature allows you to quickly locate devices based on the following criteria:
Civic Location (for example, San Jose)
Host/Device name (for example, NAT-01)
IP address (for example, 121.10.10.1.1)
Import and Export geographical objects using Keyhole Markup Language (KML) format:
Using the Crosswork Network Controller UI, you can import and export KML files to exam, change, or add device geographical information and see the updates in the UI map. For example, you may use the export function to download your device’s data in KML format to your system, exam and/or change the device details, and upload it into a map generator (such as Google Maps) to view your updated device information and coordinates outside of Crosswork Network Controller. You can then use the import function to upload the updated, or browse for a new, KML file back into Crosswork Network Controller. If changes were made, they will now appear in the geographical map after it refreshes. When using the import function, Crosswork Network Controller also provides a sample KML template. The sample KML template provides information on where to identify devices and their coordinates, an optional device name, and the IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of a device with corresponding coordinates. This template can be used on your system before importing back into Crosswork Network Controller.
Traffic Engineering device details improvements that will provide options, after selecting a device from the topology map, to select different TE tabs (such as Links, Alarms, SR-MPLS, SRv6, RSVP-TE and others) that provide associated data for the selected device’s policies and prefixes.
Note
  For more information on Crosswork UI improvements, see the Crosswork Optimization Engine 5.0 User Guide section, Visualize Traffic Engineering Services.
Crosswork Provisioning UI Improvements
Dry Run for a deleted service: When decommissioning a service, only the configuration related to a service is deleted on the device. By implementing Dry Run, it shows the user the configuration that is deleted from multiple devices.
Edit in json configuration editor: Using the json configuration editor, you can highlight different details that make up the service configuration and edit them directly in the json editor before committing the configuration.
Clone existing services: Clone existing services and policies and utilize the json configuration editor to make changes to your cloned configuration. By cloning existing services and policies, you save time and ensure consistency across configurations.
Show all fields toggle option: When editing a service configuration, you can either hide multiple fields that do not pertain to the editable service configuration or you can view all fields by using the Show all fields toggle option.
Due to NSO Core Function Pack (CFP) model version upgrade, L2VPN, L3VPN or RSVP-TE upgrade is not supported from 4.x to 5.0. SR-TE upgrade from 4.x to 5.0 is supported. Direct upgrade from 3.x to 5.0 is not supported.

Important Notes
Take into consideration the following important information before starting to use Cisco Crosswork Network Controller 5.0.x:
Cisco Crosswork Infrastructure:
It is recommended to deploy Cisco Crosswork on a highly available cluster (vSphere HA) with shared storage.
Managed devices, VM host and the VMs should use the same NTP source to avoid time synchronization issues.
Confirm that the DNS and NTP servers are properly configured and reachable on the network the Crosswork cluster will be using.
Use Terminal Access-Control System Plus (TACACS+), Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) or Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for auditing purposes.
During configuration, note the Cisco Crosswork UI and CLI user names and passwords. Due to added security, the only way to recover the administrator password is to re-install the software.
In situations where it is expected to work with SR-PCE (for L3 topology discovery), we recommend the use of dual SR-PCEs.
Use CSV files to quickly import and on-board device, credential, and provider information.
Obtaining Cisco Geomaps for topology map renditions:
Cisco Crosswork Network Controller allows users to obtain downloadable geographical maps (geomaps) based on their specific topology mapping needs. If your environment allows contact with the map provider website we specify in Crosswork, you do not need to download the map files. If your environment does not allow outside access, you will need to download the map files for the areas where your network requires coverage.
VPN Service Provisioning:
The Cisco NSO sample function packs are provided as a starting point for VPN service and RSVP-TE provisioning functionality in Cisco Crosswork Network Controller. While the samples can be used “as is” in some limited network configurations, they are intended to demonstrate the extensible design of Cisco Crosswork Network Controller. Answers to common questions can be found here and Cisco Customer Experience representatives can provide answers to general questions about the samples. Support for customization of the samples for your specific use cases can be arranged through your Cisco account team.

Note
For licensing and ordering information, work with your Cisco Partner or Cisco Sales representative to review the options described in the Cisco Crosswork Network Controller Ordering Guide.
Known Issues and Limitations
The table below shows known issues and limitations that should be taken into account before starting to work with Cisco Crosswork Network Controller 5.0.x.
Table 9. Known Issues and Limitations
Issue/Limitation
Context within Cisco Crosswork Network Controller
Crosswork cluster uses the following IP ranges for internal communications. This cannot be changed. As a result, these subnets cannot be used for devices or other purposes within your network.
You are recommended to isolate your Crosswork cluster to ensure all the communications stay within the cluster. Please also ensure that address spaces do not overlap for any of the external integration points (e.g. connections to devices, connections to external servers that Crosswork is sending data to, connections to the NSO server, etc.).
Note
  This is applicable for cluster installation and for adding a static route.

Installation
During the initial installation of Crosswork, the zookeeper instance may go into crashbackoff state continuously. At first, the UI health for one zookeeper pod will show down/degraded resulting in the zookeeper pod constantly restarting. The zookeeper_stdout.log logs for the pod will show the following (example of details): [main] ERROR org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumPeer - Unable to load database on disk. As a workaround, go to the node where the zookeeper pod is crashing and do the following:
cd /mnt/cw_ddatafs/robot-zookeeper
rm -rf data/version-2
rm -rf log/version-2
kubectl delete pod robot-zookeeper-X --force --grace-period=0
This removes the bad data and restarts the zookeeper pod so that it replicates from the two running instances.
Installation
The number of nodes installed in Cisco Crosswork 5.0 must be equal or more than the number of nodes in earlier version of Cisco Crosswork.
Third-party device configuration in Device Management and Cisco NSO is not migrated and needs to be re-applied on the new version post migration.
Custom user roles (Read-Write/Read) created in earlier version of Cisco Crosswork are not migrated and need to be recreated manually on the new Cisco Crosswork version post migration.
Any user roles with administrative privileges in the earlier version of Cisco Crosswork must be assigned new permissions after the upgrade to continue being administrative users. 
Crosswork Health Insights KPI alert history is not preserved as part of the migration. The system will need to be given some time to establish a new baseline for some KPIs. This may result in false alarms until the new base line is established.
For more information, see the Upgrade Cisco Crosswork chapter in the Crosswork Network Controller 5.0 Installation Guide.
Upgrade
Sometimes, NETCONF reachability times out for IOS XE devices. To recover, try increasing the NETCONF reachability timer to a higher timeout value (for example, 120 seconds).
While retrieving device inventory via API from Cisco Crosswork, use page size of 200.
In case of Cisco NSO Layered Service Architecture (LSA), the migration of devices between Resource Facing Service (RFS) nodes is not supported. If you try to move the devices between RFS nodes, it creates a duplicate device entry in Cisco NSO. See the Onboard and Manage Devices chapter in Cisco Crosswork Network Controller 5.0 Administration Guide for details and instructions on removing duplicates.
Although the integration between Cisco NSO and Device Lifecycle Management (DLM) is automated, manual action is needed after a Cisco NSO recovery when the device admin status must go through DOWN/UP states. In this case, you must manually listen to NSO notifications that notify degradation within NSO and retry the action while NSO is up.
Device Management
Each time the job list (located on the left side) is refreshed in the Collection Jobs window, the corresponding job details pane (located on the right side) must be manually refreshed.
A user session will not be terminated when you close the tab or the browser. The only way to remove a user session is to either log out from Crosswork or terminate the session from the User window (Administration > User and Roles > Active Sessions).
UI
Alarms, faults, errors, or any status indications for Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway will not be reflected on the VM node or its operational state.
Alerting service can become unresponsive during stress testing. Alerts related to Crosswork applications may not be generated during this time. If this happens, Cisco Crosswork will recover the alerting by automatically restarting the service.
If the node containing the Cisco Crosswork orchestrator is restarted, it might take up to 10 minutes before the health of the cluster can be viewed.
Alerts
PCE is required for L3 link topology mapping.
Enable traps on routers to receive L2 link down and up status changes quickly. Otherwise, it may take one SNMP poll cadence (default is 5 minutes) to see the L2 link status change.
Topology
Cisco Crosswork will not allow you to power off two hybrid nodes at the same time. If a system loses a hybrid node due to any faults, it must be replaced as soon as possible.
High Availability
If you restart microservices for a Crosswork application, the microservice may appear removed upon restart, but the application will continue to show a healthy status.
Crosswork Manager
Fault service does not generate the SWT_SWITCH_DOWN alarm when a device becomes unreachable.
Localization of the ospfIfStateChange, ospfIfConfigError, ospfIfAuthFailure, ospfIfRxBadPacket, and ospfTxRetransmit alarms happens to loopback() from day 1.
Cisco Element Management Functions (EMF) Services
In rare cases, after the successful registration, the License Authorization Status in the Smart Licensing page is not changed and will continue to display as being in EVALUATION mode. As a consequence, the evaluation timer will be started and incorrect messages will be displayed to the user. As a workaround, please de-register and register the product again.
Smart Licensing
After importing a new custom Heuristic Package, if you then select Editing Monitoring Settings for an existing service to switch between monitoring levels (Basic/Advanced), the request to edit the settings will fail. Instead, after importing a new custom Heuristic Package, you must next stop or start an existing service. 
Service Health
L2VPN MPLS-EVPN over ODN-based policy monitoring is only supported for multi-point and not point-to-point. If, in this situation, point-to-point is selected, there will be no subservices for the associated ODN policies in Service Health Assurance Graph even though, on the device, the service is up (good health) and the ODN policies that are instantiated are up (good health).
Service Health L2VPN over ODN
If you shut down an SR Policy (L2VPN EVPN SR-TE service with fallback enable with Y1731 configured) at one endpoint, it results in packet loss and the Y1731 peer MEP check fails with symptoms flapping between up and peer-mep-failed and cross-check-missing in the device.
SR Policy
If service monitoring fails due to transient errors, such as HPM “nats time out”, stop and then restart service monitoring.
Service Health
Only enable one discovery protocol (CDP or LLDP) on an ethernet link when enabling protocols in the Layer 2 (L2) discovery settings. If you enable both CDP and LLDP on the same ethernet link and enable both protocols in the L2 discovery settings, it will result in duplicate links in the UI.
Layer 2 Discovery
After monitoring fails in one of the worker nodes in a cluster, stopping and restarting the monitoring again does not resolve the issue and the service remains in error state while Assurance Graph remains unavailable. After the node is recovered and is again up (with all CAPPs and pods in a healthy state), the service remains in error state.
Service Health
Explicit Circuit Style policy creation in Crosswork Network Controller through NSO CFP is not supported.
With NSO CFP, Circuit Style policies are only supported with L2VPN VPWS.
NSO CFP does not check existing Circuit Style/Segment Routing (SR) policies that have the same Headend/Tailend color combination.
Crosswork Network Controller/Circuit Style provisioning though NSO Core Function Pack (CFP)
With Circuit Style, IOS XE and IPv6 are not supported.
Circuit Style
NSO service pack implementation should support proper handling of zombies and ensure that the delete service-state-change notifications be sent when a zombies for the service are removed for a proper integration with Cisco Crosswork Network Controller UI. Without this support, deleting or redeploy of a service from Cisco Crosswork Network Controller UI may not work as expected.
NSO service pack implementation
Service Health’s corresponding VPN remains in a healthy state (it does not fail or move to a degraded state) after the user powers off Cisco Data Gateway (CDG) and the collection jobs become degraded as expected. In this scenario, a user onboards devices attached to a CDG with no spare on the pool. An L3VPN service is created and is enabled to monitor with Advanced/gold profile. Once the Service Health service shows a healthy state, CDG is powered off and collection jobs become degraded. Because Service Health is live monitoring, the user would expect the corresponding VPNs to also become degraded or fail and not remain in a healthy state.
Service Health
Service Health subservices end up in initialization state or monitoring failed state after the following scenario: Load devices with JSON IETF, with one device being version 17.9.1 OS and the other device being version 17.6.3 OS, and then increase the timeout for both ASR920s. Create a L3VPN service with Loopback, enable a device to monitor service health, and then review the status for all subservices. In result, only interface health is supported and collection jobs scheduled. In addition, other subservices get scheduled but end up in initialization state or monitoring failed state.
Service Health
L2VPN cannot support the use of the SRv6TE or SRv6TE ODN (via route policy).
Route Policy
Secure ZTP image upgrade from 7.5.2 to 7.8.1, or 7.9.1 for IOS-XR NCS 55xx platforms, will fail due to a defect. This defect is resolved and fix is available on newer releases (7.9.2 and 7.10.1 IOS-XR version). Users cannot perform secure ZTP image install on versions 7.8.1 and 7.9.1, but can still perform the Day0 configuration upgrade operation without the image upgrade on the above IOS-XR versions.
Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP)
Configuration upgrade fails with large files for IOS-XE ASR920 devices in 17.9.1 version.
Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP)
Associating an SR-TE policy with L2VPN-MPLS-EVPN is not supported.
SR-TE policies are not supported with the following: L2VPN-ETREE-hub-spoke, L2VPN-ELAN-p2mp, L2VPN-ELAN-any-any.
SR-TE Policy
Explicit path is not supported for SRv6 policy. However, when provisioning an SRv6 policy, if the candidate path is configured prior to enabling SRv6, the Explicit Path option is visible and can be committed with no warning and the explicit path configuration is ignored when SRv6 policy is pushed to the devices. If SRv6 is enabled first, before configuring the path, the Explicit Path option is not visible due to no SRv6 explicit path support.
Provisioning an SRv6 policy and configuring the Path
SR-ODN policy is not created on Traffic Engineering (TE) and Transport tabs even though the device’s policy has an operational UP status. This occurs if the router-id of any device is updated. In result, the topology must be rebuilt by re-importing the PCE and restarting the topo-svc service so that functionality works as expected.
SR-ODN Policy
L2VPN services may get stuck in an “in-progress” state after provisioning from the NSO UI. After loading different types of services from the NSO UI and cleaning them up, if you then reprovision those cleaned up services, those services will become stuck in an in-progress state. In this case, re-deploy the services stuck in-progress state so services regain a success state.
L2VPN Services
For the brownfield or greenfield customized service models that have schema with node type instance-identifier in the yang model, the Edit In Json Editor and Clone operation might not always work as expected.
Provisioning UI
Custom templates cannot be created using the UI, nor can their contents be visualized in the UI. Custom templates created offline can be applied to service models via UI and API. However, topology map overlays and service configuration views will not display custom template configuration.
Provisioning UI
Services can be provisioned to devices when devices are not mapped to Cisco Crosswork Network Controller or are operationally down, provided they are reachable and in sync with NSO.
