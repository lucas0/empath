NAT66 DIA Support
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1
The IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Address Translation (NAT66) Direct Internet Access (DIA) feature enables an IPv6 device to translate an inside source address prefix to an outside source address prefix in IPv6 packet headers.
NAT66 DIA allows you to direct local IPv6 internet traffic to exit directly to the internet from the service-side VPN (VPN 1) through the transport VPN (VPN 0).
You can configure NAT66 DIA using Cisco vManage, the CLI, or a device CLI template.
This feature introduces new CLI commands. For more information on the new NAT commands, see the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Qualified Command Reference Guide.

Information About NAT66 DIA
IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix Translation (NPTv6) is a mechanism that is used to convert an IPv6 address prefix to another IPv6 address prefix. The address translation method used is IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Address Translation (NAT66). A device that supports a NAT66 function is known as a NAT66 translator. A NAT66 translator provides source and destination address translation capability.

Note
NPTv6 functionality was already available on Cisco IOS XE platforms before it was introduced in Cisco SD-WAN in the Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.1a. For more information, see the IP Addressing: NAT Configuration Guide.
NAT66 DIA allows you to redirect or forward packets from one network to another in an IPv6 environment. NAT66 DIA provides an algorithmic translation function with a 1:1 relationship between addresses within the inside network and the outside network. You can interconnect different networks and support multihoming, load balancing, and peer-to-peer networking.
NAT66 DIA supports prefixes longer than 64 bits and static IPv6 host-to-host translations. Only the prefix portion of an IPv6 address is translated.

Note
To access Cisco vManage using an IPv6 address, specify port number 8443 in the URL.
Example:
https://[cisco-vmanage IPv6-address]:8443/
How NAT66 DIA Works
Benefits of NAT66 DIA
How NAT66 DIA Works
An IPv6 client in a branch site attempts to access Cisco vManage in a data center on the transport side of the network (VPN 0).
The Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device routes the IPv6 address from the service VPN (VPN 1) to the next-hop transport VPN (VPN 0), which is the WAN side of the network.
A NAT66 translator performs an IPv6-to-IPv6 prefix translation. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 (DHCPv6) requires a source IPv6 prefix in the IPv6 prefix range for prefix delegation.
NAT66 conversion occurs in the transport VPN interface.
DHCPv6 prefix delegation allows an ISP to automate the process of assigning prefixes to a customer for use within the customer's network. Prefix delegation occurs between a provider edge (PE) device and customer premises equipment (CPE) using the DHCPv6 prefix delegation option. After an ISP has delegated prefixes to a customer, the customer can further divide the network and assign prefixes to the links in the customer's network.
When traffic is returned from Cisco vManage, the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device looks up the NAT66 entry in the DIA route table and forwards the packet to the client's IPv6 address.
Benefits of NAT66 DIA
Supports local IPv6 internet traffic to exit directly to the internet from the service-side VPN through the transport VPN
Allows you to redirect or forward packets from one network to another in an IPv6 environment
Enables good application performance
Contributes to reduced bandwidth consumption and latency
Contributes to lower bandwidth cost
Enables improved branch office user experience by providing DIA at remote site locations

Workflow for Enabling NAT66 DIA and a NAT66 DIA Route
Enable NAT66 DIA using a Cisco VPN Interface Ethernet feature template for IPv6.
A Cisco VPN Interface Ethernet template is used as a transport (WAN) interface.
For more information on enabling NAT66 DIA using a Cisco VPN Interface Ethernet template, see Configure NAT66 DIA.
Configure a NAT66 DIA IPv6 route using a Cisco VPN feature template, which is a service-side VPN (VPNs other than VPN 0).
For more information on configuring a NAT66 DIA IPv6 route, see Configure a NAT66 DIA Route.

Configuration Example for NAT66 DIA
Configure NAT66 DIA
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Templates.
Click Feature Templates.

Note
In Cisco vManage Release 20.7.x release, Feature Templates is titled Feature.
