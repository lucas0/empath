Overview
The Cisco Customer Loyalty Program is our way of rewarding loyal customers for purchasing Cisco products and services. Customers are nominated to the program by their Account Manager, and rewards are based on a customer’s purchase of Cisco products and services. As customers earn CLCs, they can redeem them to develop and implement a comprehensive learning roadmap for their business.
Nomination period
Customer nominations can be submitted at any time. They are reviewed the first two months of Q2, Q3, and Q4. Engage with your Cisco Account Manager to learn more about the program and to see if your company qualifies.
Earning Cisco Learning Credits
Loyalty customers are awarded CLCs based on three-year average net product and service bookings. Once awarded, CLCs are valid for one year.
The Cisco Loyalty Program FY23 Award Tier Table below shows how the amount of bookings correlates to Cisco Learning Credit quarterly and annual awards. Customer tiering is re-evaluated each year during the first quarter of Cisco’s fiscal year to determine tier-level changes.
