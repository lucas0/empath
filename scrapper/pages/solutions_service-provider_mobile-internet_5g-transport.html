Cisco Open Access IP/Ethernet architecture
The architecture connects all categories of the mobile network infrastructure, including fronthaul, midhaul, and backhaul. It utilizes a unified forwarding plane with traffic steering capabilities, statistical multiplexing across the network, and consistent end-to-end operations administration and maintenance (OAM) to deliver the most efficient use of resources with scalability.
Purpose-built for software defined 5G mobile networks that support enhanced mobile broadband, ultra low-latency, and massive IOT use cases.
Designed for seamless optimization and automation that delivers industry-leading economics and operational KPIs from the client to the cloud.
Incorporates trustworthy network features from the inside out.
Industry-validated for open vRAN deployments to drive flexibility and choice in future radio selection and end-to-end network slicing.

Benefits of Cisco 5G Transport
  Reduces capital expenditures with a single converged network that delivers physical access independence across microwave, fiber, and cable for “last connection”.
Provides faster, simpler automated operations, provisioning, and management, which lowers operating expenses.
Helps shift compute loads to the edge with multi-access edge compute (MEC).
Offers freedom from proprietary interfaces using Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI) and improved archiectural flexibility for radio placement (RRH, DU, and CU) with no radio vendor lock-in.
The building blocks
Deploy an end-to-end transport solution with products that support fronthaul (eCPRI), midhaul, and backhaul. Embrace emerging RAN standards for an all-IP network across 5G services types (eMBB, ULLRC, mMTC) and wireline services.
