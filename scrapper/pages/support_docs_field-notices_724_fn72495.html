CSCwa31249 N9K stuck in boot loop due to policyelem hap reset after conversion to ACI
Problem Description
Nexus 9000 Series switches shipped from the Service Depot via a Return Material Authorization (RMA) might fail when an upgrade to Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) Release 4.2 and later is performed.
If you plan to upgrade an active network that is an earlier release of ACI to the impacted Release 4.2 or later, you must replace the switch prior to upgrade or this device will NOT work with the new software.
New switches received directly from manufacturing are not affected.
Nexus Operating System (NX-OS) software does not use this certificate. Switches that use NX-OS are not affected.
Background
There was a change in the manufacturing process which was not reflected at the same time in the Service Depots. As such, Nexus 9000 Series switches that were handled by Service Depots during this time via an RMA went through a different certificate provisioning process.
Problem Symptom
If you have an affected switch that runs any ACI release earlier than Release 4.2, no issue is exhibited.
If you upgrade an affected switch to ACI Release 4.2 or later, the "policyelem hap reset" issue is exhibited.

If your switch continually exhibits the "hap reset" error only on Release 4.2 and later, complete these steps in order to verify if it is affected:
Reload the switch and break into the loader.
Enter these commands in order to boot the switch and quell the constant crashing:
cmdline no_hap_reset
boot
Verify that cert_extraction looks for 2099 (= TRUE):
Leaf# egrep 2099 /mnt/pss/bootlogs/current/cert_extract.log

...

2099 SUDI CERT present = TRUE

...
Verify these Policy Element (PE) logs:
Leaf# cat /tmp/logs/dme_logs/svc_ifc_policyelem.log*

Workaround/Solution
If your switch is impacted, and you will use it to upgrade to ACI Release 4.2, call the Technical Assistance Center (TAC) for a replacement.
A replacement is ONLY required if the switch is used in ACI mode in the network and there are plans to upgrade the switch to Release 4.2.
How To Identify Affected Products
In order to validate if your product is impacted, use the Serial Number Validation Tool described in the Serial Number Validation section.
Serial Number Validation
Cisco provides a tool to verify whether a device is impacted by this issue. In order to check the device, enter the device's serial number in the Serial Number Validation Tool.
Note: For security reasons, you must click on the Serial Number Validation Tool link provided in this section to check the serial number for the device. Use of the Serial Number Validation Tool URL external to this field notice will fail.
Upgrade Program
A Form must be filled out for each separate Ship to Address.

The Upgrade Order Reference Number should be unique for each time the Form is filled out.

Please enter a valid AFFECTED Serial Number in the Form, if there is not enough space, enter additional serial numbers in the NOTES section.
Depending on material availability, both you AND the Customer email address will receive a confirmation email with Order# within 2 -5 days. Some UMPIRE orders are proactive replacements and do NOT adhere to normal SLAs or Service Contracts.

NOTE: If your Ship to Address is in the following countries, please expect delays of up to 3 months depending on importation regulations: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela, India, All countries in Asia (i.e. Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, China, Vietnam, Korea, Thailand, Philippines), and all non-EU countries (ie: UAE, Turkey). You will receive your Order# at that time. Thank you for your patience as this process is beneficial for the customer; it will save them the cost of vat/duty in these countries (which is very high). If you have not received an email with an Order# after 10 days, please send an email with your Request#(s) and Customer in the Subject line to:mailto:umpire-escalations@cisco.com
