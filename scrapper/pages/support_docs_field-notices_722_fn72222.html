Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCwa56866 End of support for redirection service (CDA / EDOS) on old firmware that use webapps.cisco.com
Problem Description
Cisco announced the end of support for the redirection service (Customer Device Activation (CDA) / Enablement Data Orchestration System (EDOS)) on earlier firmware that uses the webapps.cisco.com sever, effective December 1, 2022. The phones and Analog Telephone Adapters (ATAs) that are currently sold with the latest firmware version are NOT impacted. The phones and ATAs already deployed in the field that run earlier firmware versions are also not impacted, except for the redirection function. Certain Cisco phones, Multiplatform Phones (MPPs), ATA191/192, and Cisco SPA112/122 ATAs still in the box with the earlier firmware are impacted.
This will take effect immediately on Cisco SPA112/122 and December 1, 2022 for other affected devices. This field notice details the devices and firmware impacted, as well as workarounds.
Background
The products affected are listed in this table.
Product Name Firmware Version
SPA112/122 Earlier than 1.4.1 SR3
MPP 6841/6851
7832/7811/7821/7841/7861
8811/8841/8851/8861

  This field notice lists the base Product IDs (PIDs), but pertains to all PIDs of the same model. See the Products Affected section for further details.
Problem Symptom
Affected platforms with earlier firmware versions will no longer be able to use the redirection service (CDA / EDOS).
After December 1, 2022, cloud provisioning via legacy CDA services on webapps.cisco.com will not work.
Workaround/Solution
Prior to December 1, 2022
The SPA112-RC and SPA122-RC will require an upgrade to the latest firmware prior to installation.
While MPPs and ATA191/ATA192 endpoints can be deployed with earlier firmware, it is recommended to upgrade to the latest firmware version. Then, at the time of installation, perform a factory reset on the device in order to retrigger EDOS activation.
The suggested firmware versions, listed by product, are in this table.
Product Name Firmware Version
SPA112-RC/SPA122-RC 1.4.1 SR5
MPP 11.3.6 and later
ATA19x 11.2.1 and later
  December 1, 2022 and Later
The SPA112-RC and SPA122-RC endpoints can be configured manually.
For the MPPs and ATA191/192 MPP endpoints, there are two options:
Configure the endpoints manually.
Upgrade to the latest firmware available and factory reset the device during installation in order to retrigger EDOS activation.
