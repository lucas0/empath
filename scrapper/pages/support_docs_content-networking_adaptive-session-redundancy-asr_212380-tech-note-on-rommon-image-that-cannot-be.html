Problem: ROMMON Image cannot be Downgraded below 15.3(3r)S
Solution
Introduction
This document describes the issue of ROMMON image on PowerPC based ASR boards that cannot be downgraded beyond 15.3(3r)S.
The manufacturer of the ROMMON boot flash for the ASR1000 PowerPC-based cards discontinued the product and replaced it with a new version. To support the new device, an update to the ROMMON was required.
Problem: ROMMON Image cannot be Downgraded below 15.3(3r)S
Boards with the newer flash device cannot be downgraded to a ROMMON image lower than 15.3(3r)S. Even though the boards with the old and the new flash operate the same way, the ROMMON image CANNOT be downgraded below 15.3(3r)S on boards with the new flash device.
Boards affected are:
ASR1000-RP1
ASR1002
ASR1000-ESP5
ASR1000-ESP10
ASR1000-ESP20
ASR1000-SIP10
ASR1000-SIP40
Solution
No workaround for this issue. In general, units with serial number JAE1843062E and above have the new flash populated and cannot be downgraded below ROMMON 15.3(3r)S. Affected units are:
ASR1000-RP1 V09
ASR1002
V07
ASR1000-ESP5 V05
ASR1000-ESP10 V07
ASR100-ESP20 V05
ASR1000-SIP10 V10
ASR1000-SIP40 V03
 PIDs, ESP20 and SIP-40 are still shipping from manufacturing. The rest are End of Production and still being supported by Services.
