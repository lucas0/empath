MSX ROI Calculator
Use the tool below to describe your usage across the key services to calculate the TCO and ROI across Time to Revenue, project Breakeven and Gross Margin analyses.
The Opportunity Cost analysis covers:
Cisco TCO (HW + SW + MSX + Support) – Cost tab
General ROI based on global managed service pricing – Revenue tab
Cost assumption to develop key MSP capabilities to offer these 3 services (Service provisioning and configuration, Multi-tenancy, Role-Based Access Control, etc) – Cost assumption in the ‘without MSX’ scenario on the Cost tab
NEW, Time calculation tab: We made a calculation that captures the operational efficiency of MSX automation as a time savings across the three key categories of service creation, device provisioning and day 2 management. This calculation takes into account time to complete an operation with and without MSX and projects the difference as the time savings in percentage points. Each of the three categories has a number of operations that we analyzed to get to a percentage saving for a given category. This is the Time calculation on the right hand side.
