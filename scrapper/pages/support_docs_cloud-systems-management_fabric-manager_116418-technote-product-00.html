Introduction
This document describes license models and the differences between Fabric Manager (FM) licenses and Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) licenses. 
License Differences
The main difference between FM and DCNM licenses is where they are installed. The FM licenses are installed on the switch (on a Multilayer Data Switch (MDS), for example), whereas the DCNM licenses for the Storage Area Network (SAN) are installed on the server, where DCNM runs.
Licenses on the Fabric Manager Server (FMS)
In the past, FMS licenses were needed in order to use certain advanced features, such as the Performance Manager. Here is an excerpt from the Unlicensed Versus Licensed Fabric Manager Server section (linked) of the Cisco Fabric Manager Fundamentals Configuration Guide.
--- snip ---
When you install Fabric Manager, the basic unlicensed version of Fabric
Manager Server is installed with it. To get the licensed features, such
as Performance Manager, remote client support, and continuously
monitored fabrics, you need to buy and install the Fabric Manager Server
 package.
--- snip ---
Since the model mandates that you must install the license on the switch, you must install the license on the switch itself. The license is one (or multiple) of those listed in this table:
Part Number
Description
M9500FMS1K9
Cisco FMS package for one Cisco MDS 9500 Series Multilayer Director
M9500FMS1K9=
Cisco FMS package for one Cisco MDS 9500 Series Multilayer Director; Spare
M9200FMS1K9
Cisco FMS package for one Cisco MDS 9200 Series Multilayer Fabric Switch
M9200FMS1K9=
Cisco FMS package for one Cisco MDS 9200 Series Multilayer Fabric Switch; Spare
M9100FMS1K9
Cisco FMS package for one Cisco MDS 9100 Series Multilayer Fabric Switch
M9100FMS1K9=
Cisco FMS package for one Cisco MDS 9100 Series Multilayer Fabric Switch; Spare
N5000FMS1K9
Cisco FMS package for one Cisco Nexus 5000 Family switch
N5000FMS1K9=
Cisco FMS package for one Cisco Nexus 5000 Family switch; Spare
On the switch, it translates to FM_SERVER_PKG. For example:
bdc-mds9148-3# show license usage

Feature                Ins    Lic   Status  Expiry   Comments
                             Count           Date
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FM_SERVER_PKG          Yes     -    Unused   never       -
ENTERPRISE_PKG         No      -    Unused               -
PORT_ACTIVATION_PKG    Yes    24    In use   never       -
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With the FM_SERVER_PKG, you can see (under FM) that the fabric is Licensed once you discover the switch, as shown in this capture:
Licenses in DCNM Versions 5 and 6
A DCNM license for SAN components comes in one of two different editions:
Essential Edition - This free edition is what you get once you install DCNM, and do not apply any license.
Advanced Edition - This is the edition you must purchase. The Advanced Edition license is based on the number and type of switches (MDS 9100, MDS 9200, MDS 9500, Nexus 5000, Nexus 7000).
Basically, the Advanced Edition is comparable to Cisco FMS: it provides additional capabilities, such as Performance Monitoring.
Aside from the Essential and Advanced Editions, the DCNM still supports the FM license model, which is the one previously described. Therefore, when you discover a switch in the fabric that still has the FM_SERVER_PKG installed, it appears as Licensed under DCNM SAN client or DCNM web client.
Here is the result of a discovery performed on the bdc-mds9148-3 switch that has the FM_SERVER_PKG installed upon discovery:
DCNM SAN 5.2
    DCNM SAN 6.1
    DCNM 6.1 webclient
  If you have a license such as the PORT_ACTIVATION_PKG, it does not appear anywhere (not in FM, nor in DCNM) because it is a feature that does not impact the advanced features you want to use in FM or in DCNM. It impacts only the switch operations.
Here is the list of DCNM licenses available for application on the DCNM server, based on the switches you want to manage with advanced features:
