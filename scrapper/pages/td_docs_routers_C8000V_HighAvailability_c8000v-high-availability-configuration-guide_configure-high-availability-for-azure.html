Configure Cloud Specific Redundancy Parameters
The following table specifies the redundancy parameters that are specific to Microsoft Azure:
Parameter Switch
Switch
Description
Node Index
-i
The index that is used to uniquely identify this node. Valid values: 1–255.
Cloud Provider
-p
Specifies the type of Azure cloud: azure, azusgov, or azchina.
Subscription ID
-s
The Azure subscription id.
Resource Group Name
-g
The name of the route table to be updated.
Route Table Name -t The name of the route table to be updated.
Route
-r
IP address of the route to be updated in CIDR format. Can be IPv4 or IPv6 address.
If a route is unspecified, then the redundancy node is considered to apply to all routes in the routing table of type “virtual appliance”.
Next Hop Address
-n
The IP address of the next hop router. Use the IP address that is assigned to this Cisco Catalyst 8000V on the subnet which utilizes this route table. Can be an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
Mode
-m
Indicates whether this router is the primary or secondary router for servicing this route. Default value is secondary.
Create a Redundancy Node
Procedure
Run the following script to create a redundancy node and add it to the database: create_node { switch value } […[{ switch value }].
You must configure the following parameters for a valid redundancy node:
Node Index
Cloud Provider
Subscription ID
Resource Group Name
Route Table Name
create_node -i 10 -p azure -s b0b1a9e2-4444-4ca5-acd9-bebd1e6873eb -g ds-rg -t ds-sub2-RouteTable -r 15.0.0.0/8 -n 192.168.7.4
If the configuration is successful, the script returns a value of zero.
Set Redundancy Node Parameters
Procedure
Command or Action Purpose
To change the value of parameters in an existing redundancy node, run the following script: set_params{ switch value } […[{ switch value }].
Example:
set_params.py -i 10 -r 15.0.0.0/16 -n 192.168.7.5
The index parameter (-i) is mandatory. This command sets the values of the specified parameters. If the specified parameter is already defined for the redundancy node, the value of the parameter is updated.
set_params -i 10 -n 192.168.7.5 -m primary
In this example, the next hop address and mode will be updated for the redundancy node with index 10.
If this configuration is successful, the script returns a value of zero.
Clear Redundancy Node Parameters
Procedure
If you want to clear the value of specified parameters for an existing redundancy node, run the following script: clear_params -i value { switch } […[{ switch }].
Example:
clear_params -i 10 -r -n
In this example, the clear_params script clears both the route and next hop address parameters.
Specify only the switch parameter when you clear an associated value. Do not include the current value of the parameter.
Note 
Only the index parameter is required. The values of any additional specified parameters are cleared.
If the clearing is successful, the script returns a value of zero.
Authenticate the Cisco Catalyst 8000V Router
To update a routing table in the Azure network, you must first authenticate the Cisco Catalyst 8000V router. This is accomplished by creating an application which represents the Cisco Catalyst 8000V router in the Azure Active Directory. You can use the application that is granted permissions, to access the Azure network resources.
You can create the application by using the following two mechanisms:
System-assigned managed identity - Azure automatically creates an application and binds it to the router. This mechanism was previously called as Managed Service Identity by Azure.
Manual application registration in Azure Active Directory - Here, the user creates an application in the Azure Active Directory, which represents the Cisco Catalyst 8000V router.
You can manually create a managed identity in Azure Active Directory by creating an application which represents the router. The application is assigned a set of identifiers; tenant ID, application ID, and application key. These application identifiers must be configured in the high availability feature either as the default AAD application or within an individual redundancy node.
Alternatively, when you create the Cisco Catalyst 8000V, you can configure Azure to create a system-assigned managed identity for the Cisco Catalyst 8000V instance. In this case, you need not configure any application identifiers in the high availability feature. That is, in the absence of the configuration of an application’s tenant ID, application ID, and application key, the high availability feature assumes that the Cisco Catalyst 8000V router is using a system-assigned managed identity.
System Assigned Managed Identity
When you create the Cisco Catalyst 8000V router, you can enable for it to be assigned a system managed identity by Azure. There are two ways in which you can create a Cisco Catalyst 8000V router from the Azure marketplace:
Solution template – A Cisco Catalyst 8000V router is created along with other Azure resources to create a networking solution in a single step.
Standalone – A standalone Cisco Catalyst 8000V is created, usually within an existing virtual network, with the base Cisco Catalyst 8000V image.
If you create a Cisco Catalyst 8000V router by using one of the solution template offerings in the Azure marketplace, a system-assigned managed identify for the Cisco Catalyst 8000V is enabled by default. If you create a standalone Cisco Catalyst 8000V by using a base Cisco Catalyst 8000V image, a system-managed identity is enabled as shown in the following image:

Manage Azure Active Directory Applications in Guestshell
There are a set of utility scripts that can be run in the guestshell environment to manage applications in the Azure Active Directory, whether they were created manually as user-assigned identities or system-assigned identities. The following sections describe the use of these scripts and how to configure the binding between a redundancy node and the application used to authenticate the Cisco Catalyst 8000V router.
Managing user-defined applications: If you have chosen to use a user-assigned identity for the Cisco Catalyst 8000V router, the application that was created in Azure Active Directory must be configured in the high availability feature. The application can be configured as the default application used for all the redundancy nodes, or for individual redundancy nodes.
Set the default application: If you configure a user-assigned application as the default application using the set_default_aad_app script, all the redundancy nodes use the specified application for authentication, unless a redundancy node has an individual application configured.
Set the Default Application
Set the default application by running the set_default_aad_app.py{ switch value } […[{ switch value }] script. See the following table for the AAD Redundancy Node Parameters:
Parameter Name
Switch
Description
Cloud Provider
-p
Specifies which Azure cloud is in use {azure | azusgov | azchina}
Tenant ID
-d
Identifies the AAD instance.
Application ID
-a
Identifies the application in AAD.
Application Key
-k
Access key that is created for the application. Key should be specified in unencoded URL format.
[guestshell@guestshell]$ set_default_aad_app.py -p azure -d c4426c0b-036f-4bfb-b2d4-5c910c5389d6 -a 3d6e2ef4-8160-4092-911d-53c8f68ba808 -k hZFvMGfzJuwFiukez27e/duyztom1bj7QL0Yix+KY9c=
[guestshell@guestshell]$ set_default_aad_app.py -h
usage: set_default_aad_app.py [-h] -p {azure,azusgov,azchina} -a A -d D -k K
AAD Application
required arguments:
  -p {azure,azusgov,azchina} <cloud_provider> {azure | azusgov | azchina}
  -a A                    to add the applicationId
  -d D                    to add the tenantId
  -k K                    to add the applicationKey
Clear the Default Application
You can clear the default user-assigned application configuration by using the clear_default_aad_app script.
[guestshell@guestshell]$ clear_default_aad_app.py
Clear the Application List
If you create a user-assigned application and associate the application with individual redundancy nodes, information about these applications is cached in memory. You can display the list of known applications by using the show_auth_applications.py script. Clear the cache using the clear_aad_application_list script.
[guestshell@guestshell]$ clear_aad_application_list.py
Managing all Applications
Use the following scripts to manage all the applications - user-assigned or system-assigned.
Showing Authentication Applications
Cisco Catalyst 8000V router maintains a list of configured applications. You can view this list by using the show_auth_applications script.
[guestshell@guestshell]$ show_auth_applications.py
Clearing the Authentication Token
When an event is triggered on a redundancy node, the Cisco Catalyst 8000V router uses the configured application to obtain an authentication token from the Azure network. This token is cached up to five minutes in the router. You can clear the cached token by using the clear_token script.
This script clears either the default user-assigned application or the system-assigned application. The script does not clear the token on any user assigned application which is explicitly configured on an individual redundancy node.
[guestshell@guestshell]$ clear_token.py
Refreshing the Authentication Token
The Cisco Catalyst 8000V router can be forced to obtain a new token for the active application by using the refresh_token script.
This script refreshes either the default user-assigned application or the system-assigned application. This script does not refresh the token on any user-assigned application which is explicitly configured on an individual redundancy node.
[guestshell@guestshell]$ refresh_token.py
Select the Authentication Application
You can choose either system-assigned or user-assigned applications to identify a Cisco Catalyst 8000V router for the purpose of authentication. You can use the same mechanism for all the applications within a single Cisco Catalyst 8000V router. You can also have multiple user-assigned applications across multiple redundancy nodes.
The following table summarizes which application is used by the Cisco Catalyst 8000V router when processing a redundancy node:
Is A Default Application Configured?
Does Node Have a User Assigned Application Configured?
Will Cisco Catalyst 8000V Use This Application?
No
No
System assigned application
No
Yes
User assigned application configured on this redundancy node
Yes
No
User assigned application configured as the default by set_default_aad_app.py
Yes
No
User assigned application configured on this redundancy node
Configuring IAM for the Route Table
Procedure
Step 1
To add an application into an existing network, in the All Resources pane, choose a private side subnet from the left pane. For example, noeem-sub1-RouteTable.
Step 2
In the center pane, select Access control (IAM). Select the plus icon to add a role assignment.
Step 3
In the Add Role Assignment screen, set the Role to Network Contributor.
Step 4
Select the Assign Access to Pulldown menu. If you are using system-assigned managed identity, select the Virtual Machine sub option and go to Step 6. If you are using user-assigned managed identity, select the option and go to step 5.
Step 5
In the Select field, enter the name of the user-assigned application that you created in Azure Active Directory. Click Save.
Step 6
In the Select field, enter the name given to the Cisco Catalyst 8000V instance. If you have configured the Cisco Catalyst 8000V instance properly for system-assigned identity, the Cisco Catalyst 8000V instance appears in the search results.
Step 7
Select the Cisco Catalyst 8000V instance by name, and click Save.
Route Table Entry Types
The route tables in Microsoft Azure support different entry types. The entry type for a route can be one of the following: Virtual network gateway, Internet, or Virtual Appliance. The next hop address identifies a resource in the Azure network.
Routes with an entry type of Virtual network gateway or Internet do not have an explicit IP address for the next hop and are not supported by the High Availability feature.
When you configure High Availability on a Cisco Catalyst 8000V instance, you can specify individual routes to be updated in the case of failure. Ensure that you configure each individual route as having an entry type of Virtual Appliance. If you configure a redundancy node that represents all the entries in the route table, ensure that all the routes have an entry type of Virtual Appliance.
Configuring the Network Security Group
If you have a network security group attached to NIC0 of the router, you must allow the BFD protocol to pass the interface. Configure an inbound and outbound security rule that allows ports 4789 and 4790 to be passed.
Configuring the Console Timeout
When you start an SSH session to the Cisco Catalyst 8000V router, ensure that you do not configure the terminal VTY timeout as infinite. That is, do not configure: exec-timeout 0 0. Use a non-zero value for the timeout; for example, exec-timeout 4 0. This command specifies a timeout of four minutes and zero seconds. The exec-timeout 0 0 command causes an issue as Azure enforces a timeout for the console idle period of 4 to 30 minutes. When the idle timer expires, Azure disconnects the SSH session. However, the session is not cleared from the point of view of the Cisco Catalyst 8000V as the timeout was set to infinite (by the exec-timeout 0 0 configuration command). The disconnection causes a terminal session to be orphaned. The session in the Cisco Catalyst 8000V remains open indefinitely. If you try to establish a new SSH session, a new virtual terminal session is used. If this pattern continues, the maximum number of simultaneous terminal sessions allowed is reached and no new sessions can be established. In addition to configuring the exec-timeout command correctly, it is also a good practice to delete idle virtual terminal sessions using the commands that are shown in the following example:
RouterA# show users
Line User Host(s) Idle Location
2 vty 0 cisco idle 00:07:40 128.107.241.177
* 3 vty 1 cisco idle 00:00:00 128.107.241.177
RouterA# clear line 2

Note
If the workaround in the preceding scenarios are ineffective, as a last resort, you can restart the Cisco Catalyst 8000V router in the Azure portal.
