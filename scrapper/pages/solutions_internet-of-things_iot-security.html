Why Cisco Industrial Threat Defense?
From OT visibility to zero-trust and all the way to a converged IT/OT security strategy, rely on Cisco through your industrial security journey.
OT visibility and threat detection
Assess your risks. Identify what's connected. Industrial Threat Defense leverages your existing network to give you comprehensive visibility, so you can detect threats at scale and strengthen your industrial security posture.
Industrial network segmentation
Prevent threats from spreading. Whether you're building your industrial DMZ, creating zones and conduits, or migrating to a zero-trust micro-segmentation strategy, Industrial Threat Defense has you covered.
Converged threat investigation and remediation
Leverage your existing security tools and practices. Industrial Threat Defense adds OT security events and context to your security operations center (SOC), so that you can build a truly converged IT/OT security strategy.
