RESTful API for Cisco vManage
The Cisco vManage supports RESTful (Representational State Transfer) API, which provides calls for retrieving real-time and static information about the Cisco SD-WAN overlay network and the devices in the network and for uploading device configuration templates and other configuration-related information. Using the RESTful API, you can design a custom portal for interacting with Cisco vManage.
The Cisco vManage API documentation is provided as part of the vManage software, at the URL https://vmanage-ip-address/apidocs. (More accurately, the full URL includes the Cisco vManage port number, https://vmanage-ip-address:8443/apidocs.) vmanage-ip-address is the IP address of the vManage server.
API calls are provided for the following categories of operations:
Certificate Management
Configuration
Device and Device Inventory
Monitoring
Real-Time Monitoring
Troubleshooting Tools
NAT configuration using REST APIs is not supported.

Note
Starting from Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.6.1, Cisco vManage supports below API limits:
API Rate-limit: 100/second
Bulk API Rate-limit: 48/minute
Real-time monitoring of APIs is CPU intensive and should be used for troubleshooting purposes only. They should not be used continuously for active monitoring of the devices.
For each group of API calls, click Show/Hide to list the individual calls and the URL for each call. Each call shows its response class, required parameters, and response messages (status codes).
Click Try It Out, to display the request URL for each API call and the format of the response body. The request URL consists of the Cisco vManage's URL, followed by /dataservice. For example, https://10.0.1.32:8443/dataservice/device/interface/statistics/ge0/0?deviceId=172.16.255.11
Below are a few examples of the URLs to use for API calls:

Replace a vEdge Router
This section describes how to replace a vEdge router at a particular location. You might do this when a vEdge router has failed completely or when a component in a router, such as one of the power supplies, has failed, and you want to replace the entire router. 
At a high level, to replace one vEdge router with another, you simply copy the configuration from the router you are removing to the new router and then put the new router into the network.
Before you can replace the vEdge router in Cisco vManage, Cisco vManage must have learned the chassis number and serial number of the replacement vEdge router.
If the replacement vEdge router is a router that you have previously received, such as a router that part of your spares inventory, Cisco vManage will have already learned the router's chassis and serial number when you previously uploaded the serial number file to Cisco vManage.
If you initiated an RMA process and have received a new router as a replacement, you need to upload the updated version of the authorized vEdge serial number file to Cisco vManage.
To replace a failed router using Cisco vManage, perform the following steps:
Copy the configuration from the failed router to the replacement router.
Invalidate the failed router. Invalidating a router deactivates its certificate and thus removes it from the overlay network.
Validate the replacement router, to activate its certificate.
The new router is a complete replacement for the failed router, its configuration is identical to that of the failed router. (Remember, though, that each router has a unique chassis number and a unique serial number in its certificate.) After you copy the configuration from the failed router to the replacement, both routers have the same configurations, including the same IP address. Two routers with the same IP address cannot be present in the network at the same time, one router must be in valid state on Cisco vManage and the other must be in invalid state—or both routers must be in invalid state.
Before You Begin
Ensure that you have uploaded the authorized serial number file to Cisco vManage.
Copy the Configuration from the Failed to the Replacement Router
From Cisco vManage, you copy the configuration from the failed vEdge router to the replacement router.
The vEdge router that you are copying the configuration from can be a device that is active in the overlay network (that is, it is in a valid state) or it can be one that is inactive (that is, it is in invalid state). For example, if you are replacing a router in which one of the two power supplies has failed, the router might still be active in the network, but if you are replacing one that has failed completely, you might have already marked it as invalid to remove it from the network.
The vEdge router that you are copying the configuration to must be in invalid state.
To view the state of a vEdge router or to change the validity state, see Validate or Invalidate a vEdge Router.
To copy the configuration from the failed router to the replacement router:
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Devices.
For the failed router, click ... and choose Copy Configuration.
In the Copy Configuration window, choose the replacement router.
Click Update.
Remove the Failed Router
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Certificates.
For the failed router, in the Validate column, click Invalid.
Click OK to confirm invalidation of the device.
Click Send to Controllers.
Add the Replacement Router
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Certificates.
For the replacement router, in the Validate column, click Valid.
Click OK to confirm validation of the device.
Click Send to Controllers.
If you attempt to validate a router that has the same IP address as another router in the network, an error message is displayed, and the validation process is terminated.
Release Information
Introduced in Cisco vManage in Release 15.4.
Replace a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Device
You might replace a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device if the device has failed completely or when a component of the device, such as one of the power supplies, has failed.
In general terms, to replace one Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device with another, copy the configuration from the device that you are removing to the new device and then add the new device into the network.
A. Copy the configuration from the device that you are replacing
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Devices.
In the list of devices, locate the device to be replaced. In the row of the device, click … and choose Running Configuration.

Note
If Cisco vManage cannot reach the device, skip to step 4 for instructions on logging in to the device directly to copy the configuration information.
Copy the text of the configuration and paste it into a text editor.
The configuration information is useful especially if you choose the manual deployment method for onboarding the new replacement device.
If the device is not reachable by Cisco vManage, log in to the device directly and use the following commands on the device to display the configuration information. Copy the configuration information from the output.
Display the running configuration and save the output to a text file.
show running-config | redirect bootflash:sdwan/ios.cli
Display the SD-WAN running configuration and save the output to a text file.
show sdwan running-config | redirect bootflash:sdwan/sdwan.cli
B. Remove the device from the overlay network
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Certificates.
In the list of devices, locate the device to be replaced. In the row of the device, in the Validate column, click Invalid, then OK.

Note
This step causes any control connections to the device to be lost.
Click Send to Controllers.
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Devices.
In the list of devices, locate the device to be replaced. In the row of the device, click … and choose Delete WAN Edge.
C. Add the replacement device to the Cisco vManage inventory
Obtain the chassis number and serial number of the replacement device.

Note
You can use the show sdwan certificate serial command on the device to display this information.
Add the new device to the inventory using one of the methods described in the Cisco SD-WAN Getting Started Guide.

Note
The methods for adding a new device to the inventory are relevant to onboarding devices in general. They are not unique to replacing a device.
D. Apply a device template to the new device, using the same device template that was applied to the device that is being replaced
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Templates.
In the row for the template that was used for the device being replaced, click … and choose Export CSV. The CSV file shows the parameters for each device to which the template is attached.
Review the exported CSV file.
If the new device is identical to the device being replaced, you do not need to update any of the parameters in the CSV file.
If the new device is not identical to the device being replaced, then optionally, you can update parameter values in the CSV file to match the new device, as required. For example, if the replacement device uses a different interface numbering, as compared with the device being replaced, you can update the parameter that specifies interface numbering.
To attach the template to the replacement device, do the following:
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Templates.
Click Device Templates.

Note
In Cisco vManage Release 20.7.x and earlier releases, Device Templates is called Device.
In the row for the template that was used for the device being replaced, click … and choose Attach Devices.
In the Attach Devices window, move the replacement device to the Selected Devices pane and click Attach.
Optionally, you can update parameters in the template before applying it to the device, using one of the following methods:
In the row of the replacement device, click … and choose Edit Device Template. Edit any parameters, as needed.
Upload the CSV file that you downloaded and edited to update the parameters for the replacement device. To upload the CSV file, click Upload (up arrow button) and navigate to the CSV file.
E. Onboard the new device
Use one of the following methods to onboard the new device.

Note
The methods for onboarding a new device to the inventory are relevant to onboarding devices in general. They are not unique to replacing a device.
Plug and Play (PnP)
For information, see the Plug and Play Onboarding Workflow section of the Cisco SD-WAN Getting Started Guide, and see the Cisco SD-WAN: WAN Edge Onboarding guide.
Bootstrap
For information, see the Non-PnP Onboarding section of the Cisco SD-WAN Getting Started Guide, and see the bootstrap deployment section of the Cisco SD-WAN: WAN Edge Onboarding guide.
Manual deployment

Note
To configure the new device, you can use the configuration files that you saved earlier in part A.

Note
The manual deployment method requires installing a root certificate authority (CA) for the new device.
For information, see the Cisco SD-WAN: WAN Edge Onboarding guide.
For information about installing a root CA, see the Enterprise Certificates section of the Cisco SD-WAN Getting Started Guide.
Using Cisco vManage on Different Servers
. You can perform the following operations in parallel from one or more Cisco vManage servers:
From the Cisco vManage menu, select Maintenance > Software Upgrade to do the following:
Upgrade the software image on a device.
Activate a software image on a device.
Delete a software image from a device.
Set a software image to be the default image on a device.
From the Cisco vManage menu, select Maintenance > Device Reboot to reboot a device.
From the Cisco vManage menu, select Configuration > Templates to manage templates:
Attach devices to a device template.
Detach devices from a device template.
Change the variable values for a device template that has devices attached to it.
For template operations, the following rules apply:
When a device template is already attached to a device, you can modify one of its feature templates. When you click Update > Configure Devices, all other template operations—including attach devices, detach devices, and edit device values—are locked on all vManage servers until the update operation completes. This means that a user on another vManage server cannot perform any template operations until the update completes.
You can perform the attach and detach device template operations on different devices, from one or more vManage servers, at the same time. However, if any one of these operations is in progress on one vManage server, you cannot edit any feature templates on any of the servers until the attach or detach operation completes.
Log In to the Cisco vManage Web Application Server
The Cisco vManage runs as a web application server through which you log in to a running Cisco vManage.
In an overlay network with a single Cisco vManage, to log in to the server, use HTTPS, and specify the IP address of the server. Enter a URL in the format https://ip-address:8443, where 8443 is the port number used by Cisco vManage. On the login page, enter a valid username and password, and then click Log In. You have five chances to enter the correct password. After the fifth incorrect attempt, you are locked out of the device, and you must wait for 15 minutes before attempting to log in again.
In an overlay network that has a cluster of Cisco vManages, the cluster allows you to log in to one of the Cisco vManages that is operating in the role of a web application server. Use HTTPS, specifying the IP address of one of the Cisco vManages, in the format https://ip-address:8443. The cluster software load-balances login sessions among the individual Cisco vManages that are acting as web application servers. You cannot control which of the individual Cisco vManages you log in to.
With a Cisco vManage cluster, if you enter invalid login credentials, it might take some time for you to see an invalid login error message, and the amount of time increases as the size of the cluster increases. This delay happens because each Cisco vManage attempts sequentially to validate the credentials. If none of the Cisco vManage servers validate you, only then do you see an invalid login error message.
To determine which Cisco vManage you are logged in to, look in the Cisco vManage toolbar, which is located at the top of the screen. To view more information about this particular Cisco vManage server, enter the name of the server in the Search filter of the Monitor > Devices.
Cisco vManage Release 20.6.x and earlier: To determine which Cisco vManage you are logged in to, look in the Cisco vManage toolbar, which is located at the top of the screen. To view more information about this particular Cisco vManage server, enter the name of the server in the Search filter of the Monitor > Network.
