Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCvz33468 ASA/FTD - NAT stops translating source addresses after changes to object-groups in manual NAT Rule
Problem Description
For some versions of Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) software, Network Address Translation (NAT) might become disabled after the object-groups in the NAT rule settings are changed.
Background
Cisco ASA and FTD software might not complete the layer 3 (L3) header of an updated source or destination address in the manual NAT rule that references the object-group with an updated nested object.
Problem Symptom
The show nat details command will indicate the new object in the NAT rule and a packet-tracer will show the traffic hitting the proper NAT rule. However, the output from the NAT will be empty as shown in this example of this issue:
Network Topology: Client > (inside) ASA (outside) > Internet

Client (local 192.168.100.10, global 1.2.3.4)

packet-tracer input inside icmp 192.168.100.10 8 0 X.X.X.X transmit

    Phase: 6
    Type: NAT
    Subtype:
    Result: ALLOW
    Config:
    nat (any,outside) source dynamic inside_hosts interface destination static obj_any obj_any
    Additional Information:
    < No data printed >

ASA(config)# sh cap out

1 packet captured

   1: 23:13:13.030866       192.168.100.10 > X.X.X.X icmp: echo request
Note that the L3 header is not translated per the NAT rule.
Workaround/Solution
Workaround
For ASA-based devices, deactivate and reactivate or remove and re-add the NAT rule as shown in this example:
ASA(config)# nat (any,outside) source dynamic inside_hosts interface destination static obj_any obj_any inactive
ASA(config)# nat (any,outside) source dynamic inside_hosts interface destination static obj_any obj_any
!
ASA(config)# no nat (any,outside) source dynamic inside_hosts interface destination static obj_any obj_any
ASA(config)# nat (any,outside) source dynamic inside_hosts interface destination static obj_any obj_any
For FTD-based devices, use the management platform (Firepower Management Center or Firepower Device Manager) to deactivate the NAT rule and push the policy, then reactivate the NAT rule and push the policy again.
  Solution
For ASA-based devices, upgrade to one of the Cisco ASA software versions shown in this table.
