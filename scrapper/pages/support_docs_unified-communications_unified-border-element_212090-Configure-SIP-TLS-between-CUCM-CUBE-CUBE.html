Introduction
This document helps configure SIP Transport Layer Security (TLS) between Cisco Unified Communication Manager (CUCM) and Cisco Unified Border Element (CUBE)
Prerequisites
Cisco recommends to have knowledge of these subjects
   SIP protocol
   Security Certificates
Requirements
Date and time must match on the endpoints (it is recommended to have the same NTP source).
CUCM must be in mixed mode.
TCP connectivity is required (Open port 5061 on any transit firewall).
The CUBE must have the security and UCK9 licenses installed.
Components Used
SIP
Selfsigned certificates
Configure
Network Diagram
Configuration steps
Step 1.  Create a trustpoint in order to hold CUBE's selfsigned certificate
crypto pki trustpoint CUBEtest(this can be any name)

 enrollment selfsigned

 serial-number none

 fqdn none

 ip-address none

 subject-name cn= ISR4451-B.cisco.lab !(this has to match the routerâ€™s host name)

 revocation-check none

 rsakeypair ISR4451-B.cisco.lab !(this has to match the router's host name)
Step 2. Once the trust point is created you run the command Crypto pki enroll CUBEtest in order to get self-signed certerticates
crypto pki enroll CUBEtest

% The fully-qualified domain name will not be included in the certificate

Generate Self Signed Router Certificate? [yes/no]: yes
If enrollment was correct you must expect the this output
Router Self Signed Certificate successfully created
 Step 3. After your obtain certificate , you need to export it
crypto pki export CUBEtest pem terminal
  The above command must generate the below certificate
      % Self-signed CA certificate:

-----END CERTIFICATE-----
  Copy the above generated Self signed certificate and paste it to a text file with file extension .pem
  Example below is named as ISR4451-B.ciscolab.pem
 Step 4. Upload the CUBE certificate to the CUCM
    CUCM OS Admin > Security > Certificate Management > Upload Certificate/Certificate chain
Certificate Purpose  =  CallManager-Trust
Upload your .pem file
Step 5. Download the Call manager self-signed certificate
Find the certificate that says Callmanager
Click on the host name
Click on download PEM file
Save it to your computer
Step 6. Upload the Callmanager.pem certificate to CUBE
Open the Callmanager.pem with a text file editor
Copy the whole content of the file
Run the this commands on the CUBE
crypto pki trustpoint CUCMHOSTNAME

 enrollment terminal

 revocation-check none

 

crypto pku authenticate CUCMHOSTNAME

 

(PASTE THE CUCM CERT HERE AND THEN PRESS ENTER TWICE)

 

    You will then see the following:

 

Certificate has the following attributes:

       Fingerprint MD5: B9CABE35 24B11EE3 C58C9A9F 02DB16BC

      Fingerprint SHA1: EC164F6C 96CDC1C9 E7CA0933 8C7518D4 443E0E84

 

% Do you accept this certificate? [yes/no]: yes

 

    If everything was correct, you should see the following:

 

Trustpoint CA certificate accepted.

% Certificate successfully imported
 Step 7. Configure SIP to use CUBE's selfsigned Certificate trustpoint
sip-ua

 crypto signaling default trustpoint CUBEtest 
 Step 8. Configure the dial peers with TLS
      dial-peer voice 9999 voip

 answer-address 35..

 destination-pattern 9999

 session protocol sipv2

 session target dns:cucm10-5

 session transport tcp tls

 voice-class sip options-keepalive

 srtp
 Step 9. Configure a CUCM SIP trunk security profile
CUCM Admin page > System > Security > SIP Trunk Security Profile
Configure the profile as shown below
Note:  It is critically important that the X.509 field matches the CN name you configured previously while you were generating the self-signed certificate

Step 10. Configure a SIP trunk on CUCM
Ensure the SRTP allowed check box is checked
Configure the proper destination address and Ensure to replace port 5060 with port 5061
Ensure to select the correct Sip Trunk Security profile (which was created in Step 9)
Save and reset the trunk.
Verify
Since you enabled OPTIONS PING on the CUCM, SIP trunk must be in FULL SERVICE state
The SIP trunk status show full service.
The dial peer status show as follow:
show dial-peer voice summary 

TAG    TYPE  MIN  OPER PREFIX    DEST-PATTERN      FER THRU SESS-TARGET    STAT PORT    KEEPALIVE

9999   voip  up   up             9999               0  syst dns:cucm10-5                  active
