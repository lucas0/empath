Introduction
This document describes how to configure an Access Server for incoming and outgoing calls on the same T1 PRI. The incoming and outgoing calls are all traffic-based and use Dial-on-Demand Routing (DDR) but do not provide backup for any other router. If you wish to configure an Access Server for Dialin calls only, refer to the document Configuring an Access Server with PRIs for incoming Async and ISDN Calls. To adapt this configuration to include backup, refer to the document Configuring and Troubleshooting DDR Backup.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Step 1 - Configure and verify that the Dialin and Dialout clients are setup correctly. Since this configuration is focused on the central site NAS configuration, we do not include a sample configuration for clients. Some client sample configurations are included below:
Dialin Client - Device that dials into the NAS:
BRI w/Dialer Profiles: Configuring an Access Server with PRIs for incoming Async and ISDN Calls - Use the client 1600 series router (hostname maui-soho-01) configuration provided in the document.
BRI w/Dialer Maps: Configuring BRI-to-BRI Dialup with DDR Dialer Maps - Use the client 1600 series router (hostname maui-soho-01) configuration provided in the document
PRI: AS5300 Dialing out with ISDN/Async (Outbound DDR) - Use the central site AS5300 (hostname as5300) configuration. That document shows outbound DDR on an Access Server, which makes it appropriate as the Dialin client in this document.
Dialout Client - Device that this NAS dials out to:
BRI w/Dialer Profiles: Configuring ISDN DDR with Dialer Profiles - Use the central site 3640 series router (hostname maui-nas-04) configuration provided in the document
BRI w/Dialer Maps: Configuring BRI-to-BRI Dialup with DDR Dialer Maps - Use the central site 3640 series router (hostname maui-nas-05) configuration provided in the document
PRI: Configuring an Access Server with PRIs for incoming Async and ISDN Calls - Use the central site AS5300 series router (hostname maui-nas-02) configuration provided in the document. If the device the NAS dials out to is another Access Server with a T1/E1 PRI circuit, then configure that device as if it were a regular Access Server accepting dialin calls.
Step 2 - Verify that the Telco circuits are functioning properly. You can use the show isdn status command to verify that the BRI or PRI circuit is functionting correctly. Refer to the document Using the show isdn status Command for BRI Troubleshooting for more information. You must also enable the T1/E1 PRI circuit for outbound calls. Contact your Telco to verify this information.
Components Used
This configuration was developed and tested using the software and hardware versions below.
NAS: Cisco AS5300 with one T1 PRI circuit. This AS5300 is running Cisco IOS Software Release 12.2(5).
Client: Cisco AS5300 with one T1 PRI circuit. This configuration is not included.
Client: Cisco 1600 with one BRI circuit. This configuration is not included.
Client: Cisco 804 with one BRI circuit. This configuration is not included.
The information presented in this document was created from devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If you are working in a live network, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command before using it.
Background Theory
In many situations, it may be necessary to use the same T1/E1 PRI circuit for Dialin and Dialout connections. The Network Access Sever (NAS) would support incoming calls from multiple ISDN users and it could also make outbound calls on the same PRI to another device. The outbound dial could also be used in a backup scenario, where the NAS would dial and connect to a peer that loses its primary WAN link.
Related Products
This configuration can be used with any router that has T1 or PRI cards. Hence, any AS5xxx series router with a T1 or PRI card can use this configuration. Cisco 2600 and 3600 series routers can also be configured to accept ISDN calls with a T1/PRI WAN interface card (WIC) or Network Module.
This configuration can also be modified to be used with E1 or PRI ports. Configure the E1 controller with the linecoding, framing and other physical characteristics supplied by the Telco. The D-channel configuration (interface Serial x:15 for E1s) is similar to the one shown here.

Network Diagram
This document uses the network setup shown in the diagram below.
Configurations
There are two primary methods for configuring an Access Server to be able to make outgoing calls and accept incoming calls on the same T1/E1 PRI. These are Dialer Profiles and Dialer Rotary Groups. Each has its benefits and drawbacks, such as:
Dialer Rotary Groups are simpler to configure and manage.
Dialer Profiles need a separate dialer interface for each incoming and outgoing call.. If you have numerous incoming and outgoing peers then the configuration will be complicated to create and maintain.
Dialer Profiles allow for client specific configuration. For example, you can specify that a certain client will be assigned an IP address from address pool A while another client will be assigned an address from pool B.
Dialer Rotary Groups allow only the same parameters to be applied to all users. Per-user customization is not possible.
Dialer Rotary Groups only allow a single interesting traffic definition for incoming and outgoing calls. Hence, you cannot configure the router to use one interesting traffic definition for incoming calls and another one for outgoing calls.
Dialer Profiles allow for separate interesting traffic definitions for each peer.
This document provides samples using Dialer Profiles and Dialer Rotary Groups on the NAS. Choose the method appropriate for your situation.

The above Dialer Profile configuration has a separate dialer interface for each incoming and outgoing call. The dialer interfaces for the incoming calls are Dialer 1 and Dialer 2, while the dialer interface for the outgoing call is Dialer100. After the incoming call is authenticated, the router binds the call to the appropriate dialer interface based on the dialer remote-name. Only the dialer interface for the outgoing call (Dialer100) has a dialer string with the number to be dialed. Only Dialer100 includes the dialer load-threshold command, since it can dial the additional links depending on the inbound or outbound load (the default is outbound).
The following configuration uses Dialer Rotary Groups for this scenario:

In the above dialer rotary group configuration, the dialer interface has a single dialer map used to dialout. Configure a dialer map for every peer that needs to be dialed.
Note: Incoming calls do not need dialer maps as they are dynamically created. This can be verified using the command show dialer map. An example is shown below:
maui-nas-03#show dialer map
Dynamic dialer map ip 172.22.53.152 name 1600-isdn-client () on Di1

! -- Dynamic dialer map for 1600-isdn-cliet created from Dialer1 ! -- (the rotary group interface).

Dynamic dialer map ip 172.22.53.151 name 800-isdn-client () on Di1

! -- Dynamic dialer map for 800-isdn-cliet created from Dialer1 ! -- (the rotary group interface).

Static dialer map ip 172.16.1.1 name lanai-nas-01 (81690) on Di1

! -- Static map configured on Dialer 1 was applied to this link ! -- connected to lanai-nas-01.
Verify
This section provides information you can use to confirm your configuration is working properly.
Certain show commands are supported by the Output Interpreter tool, which allows you to view an analysis of show command output.
show isdn status - Ensures that the router is properly communicating with the ISDN switch. In the output, verify that Layer 1 Status is ACTIVE, and that the Layer 2 Status state = MULTIPLE_FRAME_ESTABLISHED appears. This command also displays the number of active calls.
show ppp multilink - Displays information on multilink bundles that are active. This command should be used to verify the multilink connection.
show dialer [interface type number] - Displays general diagnostic information for interfaces configured for DDR. If the dialer came up properly, the Dialer state is data link layer up message should appear. If physical layer up appears, then the line protocol came up, but the Network Control Protocol (NCP) did not. The source and destination addresses of the packet that initiated the dialing are shown in the Dial reason line. This show command also displays the timer's configuration and the time before the connection times out.
show caller user username detail - Shows parameters for the particular user such as the IP address assigned, PPP and PPP bundle parameters, and so on. If your version of Cisco IOS software does not support this command, use the show user command.
show dialer map - Displays configured dynamic and static dialer maps. This command can be used to see if a dynamic dialer map was created. Without a dialer map, you cannot route packets.
Below are some show command outputs for successful calls. Pay attention to the bolded sections and the comments provided in the outputs. Compare the output that you obtain with the result shown below.

Troubleshoot
This section provides information you can use to troubleshoot your configuration.
Troubleshooting Resources
Use the following troubleshooting resources as required:
Incoming ISDN Call Troubleshooting - For ISDN call failure troubleshooting.
PRI ISDN Callin - Additional information on troubleshooting ISDN call failures.
T1 troubleshooting flowchart - Use this flowchart if you suspect that the T1 circuit is not working properly.
T1 PRI Troubleshooting - Troubleshooting procedure for ISDN PRI circuits.
Loopback Tests for T1/56K Lines - To verify that the T1 port on the router is functioning correctly.
Using the show isdn status Command for BRI Troubleshooting - Use this document for BRI troubleshooting.
Troubleshooting ISDN BRI Layer 3 using the debug isdn q931 Command - Use this document ISDN Layer 3 troubleshooting.
Troubleshooting Commands
Certain show commands are supported by the Output Interpreter tool, which allows you to view an analysis of show command output.
Note: Before issuing debug commands, please see Important Information on Debug Commands.
debug dialer - Displays DDR debugging information about the packets received on a dialer interface. This information can help to ensure there is interesting traffic that can use the dialer interface.
debug isdn q931 - Shows call setup and tear down of the ISDN network connection (Layer 3).
debug ppp negotiation - Displays information on the PPP traffic and exchanges while negotiating Link Control Protocol (LCP), Authentication, and Network Control Protocol (NCP). A successful PPP negotiation will first open the LCP state, then Authenticate, and finally negotiate NCP. Multilink Parameters such as Maximum Receive Reconstructed Unit (MRRU) are established during LCP negotiation.
debug ppp authentication - Displays PPP authentication protocol messages, including CHAP packet exchanges and Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) exchanges.
debug ppp error - Displays protocol errors and error statistics associated with PPP connection negotiation and operation.
Below is the debug outputs for a successful outgoing call. Pay attention to the bolded sections and the comments provided in the outputs. Compare the output that you obtain with the result shown below.
