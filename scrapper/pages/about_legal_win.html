Closing the women inventor gap
Cisco is a proud signatory of The Diversity Pledge, a commitment to understand and address the issue of underrepresented inventors and to facilitate more participation in the innovation ecosystem so that all people and ideas have an opportunity for success. We are on a mission to educate and empower our people to participate in the patent pipeline.
In 2020, Cisco launched WIN++, a guided mentorship program matching small teams of diverse employees with an experienced mentor, with the goal of submitting an invention disclosure by the end of the program for consideration by one of Cisco's patent committees.
