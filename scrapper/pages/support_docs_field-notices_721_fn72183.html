Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCvy00128 BEMS01272985 MS trap msHTTPFileNotFound when 304 response received from AS on media file GET
Problem Description
With Cisco BroadWorks Media Server Release Independent (RI) 2021.03 and earlier, media file downloads can fail and generate an msHTTPFileNotFound alarm.
Background
The library that the Cisco BroadWorks Server uses to handle file downloads was upgraded as part of the 2021.01 release. With this library, the Cisco BroadWorks Server keeps its HTTP connections alive in order to reduce processing and speed up file downloads. The Application Server (AS) terminates these HTTP connections when they are idle for more than five seconds, which keeps the number of connections under control.
When the Cisco BroadWorks Server tries to reuse an HTTP connection that is being torn down by the AS, the AS might terminate the connection. The termination will occur just as the Cisco BroadWorks Server is sending its request. When this situation happens, the file download fails and an alarm is raised.
Problem Symptom
The Media Server produces an msHTTPFileNotFound alarm and returns a code="400" response to the AS with the text "failure while retrieving audio files." This response causes the AS to release the call.
Workaround/Solution
This Cisco BroadWorks Media Server release must be applied to correct the issue:
MS_Rel_2021.04_1.251
  BroadWorks patches can be downloaded from the Cisco Software Download Center after logging in with your Cisco.com (CCO) account.
To check the version of BroadWorks that is currently deployed and the patches that are currently activated, execute the get versions all command from the CLI. More information on how to check the patch level can be found in the Cisco BroadWorks Maintenance Guide.
