Setup and Deployment
Setup: It's quick and easy (as long as your admin has registered your DX; see below). You can configure the device yourself, and the setup assistant takes only a few minutes. View the DX650 User Guide (PDF - 3.97 MB) to get started.
Deployment: You will need to register DX Series devices to Cisco Unified Call Manager (UCM). As the primary platform for Cisco Collaboration, UCM supports an integrated feature set and advanced capabilities. Remote users can register to UCM through Cisco AnyConnect VPN.
Connect the DX Series and a nearby PC to your LAN using built-in Ethernet ports. If you want, designate separate VLANs for the PC and phone to improve reliability of voice and data traffic. Or, you can connect it to a Wi-Fi access point using its antenna. See the DX Series Administration Guides.
