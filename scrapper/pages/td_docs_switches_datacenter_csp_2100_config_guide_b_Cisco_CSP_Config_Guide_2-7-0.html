Configuring Cisco CSP
This guide describes how to configure various Cisco CSP features available in Release 2.4.1 and later releases.
Information About Cisco Cloud Services Platform
Cisco Cloud Services Platform is a software and hardware platform for data center network functions virtualization. This open kernel virtual machine (KVM) platform, with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as the base operating system, is designed to host networking virtual services. Cisco CSP provides REST APIs, a web interface, and a CLI for creating and managing the virtual machine (VM) lifecycle.
Supported Cisco Networking Services
Cisco CSP can host any Cisco or third-party VNF that is supported on KVM hypervisor. Some of the Cisco VNFs available include the following:
Cisco Cloud Services Router (CSR) 1000V virtual router
Cisco IOS® XRv 9000 Router
Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)
Cisco Firepower™ NGFW Virtual
Cisco Prime® Virtual Network Analysis Module (vNAM)
Cisco Virtual Wide Area Application Services (vWAAS)
Cisco Web Security Virtual Appliance (WSAv)
Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE)
Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC)
Cisco Virtual Security Gateway (VSG) for Cisco Nexus® 1000V Series Switch deployments
Cisco Virtual Supervisor Module (VSM) for Cisco Nexus 1000V Series Switch deployments
Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM)
Important Notes and Restrictions
Following are the important notes and restrictions for Cisco CSP.
Configuration Limits
Use the following configuration limits for Cisco CSP.
Component
Supported Limits
Number of services in a node with hyperthreading disabled
For Cisco CSP with 8 or less than 8 cores, you can deploy the following number of VM cores:
Number of Cores – 1
For example, for Cisco CSP with 8 cores, you can deploy 7 VM cores.
For Cisco CSP with greater than 8 and less than or equal to 16 cores, you can deploy the following number of VM cores:
Number of Cores – 2
For example, for Cisco CSP with 16 cores, you can deploy 14 VM cores.
For Cisco CSP with greater than 16 cores, you can deploy the following number of VM cores:
Number of Cores – 4
For example, for Cisco CSP with 36 cores, you can deploy 32 VM cores.
Total number of nodes in a cluster
10
Number of vNICs per service
24
Hyper-Threading Technology Support
Cisco CSP hardware supports Hyper-Threading (HTT). However by default, HTT is disabled and must be kept disabled, as it is not supported. This action avoids VNFs sharing same CPU cores, cache and memory bus that can result in stalls or latency issues, and VNF data plane performance degradation. The enablement or disablement of Hyper-Threading is done by CIMC on CSP 5000 hardware.
Changing IP Address of the Management Interface for NFS Configurations
If NFS is configured on the system, note the following:
Changing the management IP address causes an outage of the VNC console and stats collection for 15 to 30 minutes.
Reboot of the system can take up to 30 minutes.
As a workaround, you can unconfigure the NFS mount before performing these operations and reconfigure the NFS mount after the operation is complete. You can also reboot the system from the Cisco CSP CIMC connection.
Configuring Passthrough Interfaces
When a service has passthrough as well as non-passthrough vNICs, we recommend that you first define the non-passthrough vNICs and then define the passthrough vNICs.
Run config terminal Command After Initial Setup
The config terminal command fails when you run it after performing the initial setup for a new installation. This happens because the admin user is not assigned to a group at the initial login. To run this command and configure Cisco CSP features, you must log out and then log in to Cisco CSP.
Spectre and Meltdown Firmware Update
This release include fixes for spectre and meltdown issue in Cisco CSP software. For firmware update, update the CIMC version to 4.0(1a). See the Cisco UCS C-Series Software Release Notes for more information about CIMC version at,
Release Notes for Cisco UCS C-Series Software, Release 4.0(1).
Configuring Management Interface
Configuring Management Interface pNIC Mode
Cisco CSP provides support for configuring the shared or dedicated mode of the management interface pNIC. In shared mode, the management interface pNIC can be shared with any service VMs. The management interface pNIC carries the management traffic of Cisco CSP and the management and data traffic of any service using this pNIC. In dedicated mode, the management interface pNIC carries only the management traffic of Cisco CSP. In shared mode, you can change the management interface pNIC to any available pNIC. In dedicated mode, you can change the management interface pNIC only to a pNIC that is not associated with any service.

Note
Changing the mode of the management interface pNIC to dedicated while a service is currently using it results into the Management PNIC already in service use error. Similarly, if the management interface pNIC is in dedicated mode and you try to create a service using the management pNIC, you get the PNIC is dedicated to management error.
You can configure the management interface pNIC mode during the initial Cisco CSP setup or later on by using the web interface, the CLI, or the REST API. For information about how to configure the management interface pNIC mode during initial setup, see the Cisco Cloud Services Platform Quick Start Guide.
Management Interface pNIC Mode Configuration
Configuration Mode
Description
Web Interface
Do the following:
Click Administration > HOST.
Choose a mode from the Management PNIC Mode drop-down list.
Click Submit.
CLI

curl -u user:password -X POST https://ip-address:port-number/api/running/resources/resource/csp -H "Content-type: application/vnd.yang.data+json" -d '{"mgmt_pnic_mode":"mgmt_pnic_mode"}'
Configuring ACL Access for the Management Interface
Cisco CSP provides support for enabling the ACL access for the management interface. When this feature is enabled, only specified source networks can access the management interface. While creating an ACL access rule, you must specify the IPv4 IP address of the source network along with the priority and the action to be taken for the packets received from the source network. You can also select a specific service type for the ACL access. You can configure this feature by using the web interface, the CLI, or REST API.
ACL Access Configuration
Configuration Mode
Description
Web Interface
Do the following:
Click Administration > IP Receive ACL.
Click the add (+) button.
Enter the IP address of the source network in the ip-address/prefix format in the Source Network field.
Choose one or more services in the Service field.
Choose an action in the value from the Action drop-down list.
Enter a priority value for the ACL rule in the Priority field.
Click Submit.
CLI

REST API
Use the following REST API:
curl -u user:password -X POST https://ip-address:port-number/api/running/resources/resource/csp/ip-receive-acls -H "Content-type: application/vnd.yang.data+json" -d '{"host":{"ip-receive-acl": {"source": "source_ip_address", "service":service", "priority":"priority", "action":"action"}}'
Resetting to Factory Default
Cisco CSP provides support for restoring to original factory defaults. This process is useful when you want to remove an undesirable configuration that is present in Cisco CSP and want to restore Cisco CSP to clean install mode. The factory reset process deletes VMs and volumes, files including logs, images, certificates, and erases all configuration. Connectivity is lost, and the admin password is changed to factory default password.

Note
Do not perform any operation for around 15 to 20 minutes while the factory reset process is in progress. The time taken for the factory reset process is almost the same as rebooting Cisco CSP.
After factory reset process is complete, Cisco CSP reboots automatically, and you are prompted with the configuration services questionnaire similar to clean installation. For more information about how to set up your Cisco CSP through clean installations, see the Cisco Cloud Services Platform Quick Start Guide.
You can restore Cisco CSP to factory default configuration by using the CLI, or the REST API.
Configuration Mode
Description
CLI
Perform a factory reset of Cisco CSP to factory defaults by using the factory-default-reset all command.
Note 
Select Yes when you are prompted with the factory default warning message.
REST API
Use the following REST API:
curl -k -u user:password -X POST https://ip-address:port-number/api/operations/factory-default-reset/all -H "Content-type: application/vnd.yang.data+json"
Configuring Dedicated Service Management Interface
Cisco CSP provides support for configuring a pNIC or a port channel to be used as the dedicated service management interface. You can configure the dedicated service management interface during the initial Cisco CSP setup or later on by using the CLI, or the REST API. For information about how to configure the dedicated service management interface during initial setup, see the Cisco Cloud Services Platform Quick Start Guide.
Guidelines for Dedicated Service Management Interface
Following are the guidelines for configuring the dedicated service management interface:
Only one dedicated service management interface can be active at a time.
The specified pNIC cannot be a member of a port channel.
The specified pNIC cannot be same as the Cisco CSP management pNIC (mgmt_pnic ).
The dedicated service management interface can be changed only when it is not in use. In addition, the port or the port channel that you are planning to assign as the dedicated service management interface should not be in use.
The dedicated service management interface can be used by multiple services and on multiple vNICs in the same service.
The dedicated service management interface is deleted only when it is not in use.
Dedicated Service Management Interface Configuration

Configuring SR-IOV Support
The SR-IOV support is configurable on per-pNIC basis. You can configure the SR-IOV support on 10G and 40G interfaces by using the web interface, the CLI, or the REST API.
Guidelines for SR-IOV Support
Following are the guidelines for configuring the SR-IOV support:
SR-IOV support cannot be configured on the management interface.
SR-IOV feature is supported only with 10G and 40G interfaces.
SR-IOV support cannot be disabled if any existing service is already using this feature.
VF interfaces come up only when the physical pNIC is up and running.
VF interfaces are used in the passthrough mode.
Up to 63 VFs are supported on a 10G interface and up to 64 VFs are supported on a 40G interface.
To add more VFs to a pNIC, you must disable the SR-IOV support and then enable it.
Only one VLAN can be configured on a VF.
Port channels are supported only on Intel X520 (Niantic) NICs.
Configuring Port Channels on SR-IOV
Cisco CSP provides support for configuring a port channel on SR-IOV VFs inside a VNF. This feature is currently supported only on Intel X520 (Niantic) NICs. To configure port channels on SR-IOV, do the following:
Procedure
Step 1
Create a VNF with two VFs. These VFs should be from two different SR-IOV-enabled pNICs.
Step 2
Create a port channel inside the VM by using the VFs from Step 1.
Step 3
Configure a port channel on the upstream switches with two Cisco CSP pNIC ports.
Note 
The two pNIC ports on the Cisco CSP can only be used for port channels. VFs from either of the pNICs cannot be used by a VM in isolation.
SR-IOV Support Configuration
Configuration Mode
Description
Web Interface
Do the following:
Click Configuration > SRIOV.
On the SRIOV Configuration page, under the Action column, click Enable SRIOV.
Enter a value in the Number of VFs field.
Choose a value from the Switch Mode drop-down list.

curl -u user:password -X POST https://ip-address:port-number/api/running/pnics/pnic -H "Content-type: application/vnd.yang.data+json" -d '{"pnic":{"name":"name", "sr-iov": {"numVFs":"numVFs", "switchMode ":"switchMode"}}'
Configuring SNMP
Information About SNMP
The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an application-layer protocol that provides a message format for communication between SNMP managers and agents. SNMP provides a standardized framework and a common language used for monitoring and managing devices in a network. SNMP supports IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. The SNMP framework consists of following parts:
An SNMP manager: The system used to control and monitor the activities of network devices using SNMP.
An SNMP agent: The software component within the managed device that maintains the data for the device and reports these data, as needed, to managing systems.
An MIB: The collection of managed objects on the SNMP agent.
Cisco CSP supports SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, and SNMPv3. Both SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c use a community-based form of security.
Configuring SNMP Support
You can configure the SNMP support in Cisco CSP by using the web interface, the CLI, or the REST API. The procedure for configuring SNMP version 2 is different from the procedure for configuring SNMP version 3. When you configure SNMP versions 1 and 2, you can optionally create or modify views for community strings to limit which MIB objects an SNMP manager can access.
Use the snmp-server commands to enable the supported versions of SNMP.

Note
The first snmp-server command that you enter enables the supported versions of SNMP. All other configurations are optional.
Creating or Modifying an SNMP View Record
You can assign views to community strings to limit which MIB objects an SNMP manager can access. You can use a predefined view or create your own view. If you are using a predefined view or no view at all, skip this task.
Perform the following steps to create or modify an SNMP view record:
Procedure
Step 1
Enter global configuration mode.
Step 2
Create a view record.
Note 
You can use the snmp-server view command multiple times to create the same view record. If a view record for the same OID value is created multiple times, the latest entry of the object identifier takes precedence.
Step 3
Exit global configuration mode.
Step 4
(Optional) Display a view of the MIBs associated with SNMP by using the show running-config snmp-server view command.
Configuring Community Strings
Use an SNMP community string to define the relationship between the SNMP manager and the agent. The community string acts like a password to regulate access to the agent on the device. Optionally, you can specify one or more of the following characteristics associated with the string:
A MIB view, which defines the subset of all MIB objects accessible to the given community.
Read and write or read-only permission for the MIB objects accessible to the community.
Perform the following steps to create or modify a community string:
Procedure
Step 1
Enter global configuration mode.
Step 2
Define the community access string.
Note 
You can configure one or more community strings.
Step 3
Exit global configuration mode.
Step 4
(Optional) Display the community access strings configured for the system with show running-config snmp-server community .
Configuring a Recipient of an SNMP Trap Operation
SNMP traps are unreliable because the receiver does not send acknowledgments when it receives traps. The sender does not know if the traps were received. However, an SNMP entity that receives an inform acknowledges the message with an SNMP response PDU. If the sender never receives the response, the inform can be sent again. Thus, informs are more likely to reach their intended destination.
To configure the device to send SNMP notifications, you must enter at least one snmp-server host command. If you do not enter a snmp-server host command, no notifications are sent. If you enter the command without keywords, all trap types are enabled for the host.
To enable multiple hosts, you must issue a separate snmp-server host command for each host. You can specify multiple notification types in the command for each host.
When multiple snmp-server host commands are given for the same host and type of notification, each succeeding command overwrites the previous command. Only the last snmp-server host command will be in effect.
The snmp-server host command is used in conjunction with the snmp-server enable command. Use the snmp-server enable command to specify which SNMP notifications are sent globally. For a host to receive most notifications, at least one snmp-server enable command and the snmp-server host command for that host must be enabled.
Perform the following steps to configure a device to send SNMP notifications:
Procedure
Step 1
Enter global configuration mode.
Step 2
Specify whether you want the SNMP notifications sent as traps or informs, the version of SNMP to use, the security level of the notifications (for SNMPv3), and the recipient (host) of the notifications.
Step 3
Exit global configuration mode.
Step 4
(Optional) Display the SNMP notifications sent as traps, the version of SNMP, and the host IP address of the notifications using show running-config snmp-server host.
Specifying SNMP-Server Group Names
You can configure an SNMP server group that maps SNMP users to SNMP views, and you can add new users to the SNMP group.
Perform the following steps to specify a new SNMP group or a table that maps SNMP users to SNMP views:
Procedure
Step 1
Enter global configuration mode.
Step 2
Configure a new SNMP group on a remote device.
Step 3
Exit global configuration mode.
Step 4
(Optional) Display information about each SNMP group on the network using the show running-config snmp-server group command.
Configuring SNMP Server Users
To configure a remote user, specify the IP address or port number for the remote SNMP agent of the device where the user resides.
For the priv-password and auth-password arguments, the minimum length is eight characters, and should include both letters and numbers.
SNMP passwords are localized using the SNMP engine ID of the authoritative SNMP engine. For informs, the authoritative SNMP agent is the remote agent. You must configure the remote agent’s SNMP engine ID in the SNMP database before you can send proxy requests or informs to it. If you forget a password, you cannot recover it and will need to reconfigure the user. You can specify either a plain text password or a localized MD5 digest.
If you have the localized MD5 or SHA digest, you can specify that string instead of the plain text password. The digest should be formatted as aabbccdd...ff where aa, bb, and cc are hexadecimal values. Also, the digest should be 16 octets for MD5 and 20 octets for SHA.

Note
Changing the engine ID after configuring the SNMP user does not allow the removal of the user. To remove the configurations, you need to first reconfigure all the SNMP configurations.
Perform the following steps to add a new user to an SNMP group:
Procedure
Step 1
Enter global configuration mode.
Step 2
Configure the SNMP engine ID.
Step 3
Configure a new user to an SNMP group.
Step 4
Exit global configuration mode.
Step 5
(Optional) Display information about the configured characteristics of an SNMP user.
Step 6
(Optional) Display information about the SNMP engine ID configured for an SNMP user using the show running-config snmp-server user command.
Setting the Agent Contact, Location, and EngineID Information
You can set the system contact, location, and engineID of the SNMP agent so that these descriptions can be accessed through the configuration file.
Perform the following steps, as required:
Procedure
Step 1
Enter global configuration mode.
Step 2
Set the system contact string.
Step 3
Set the system location string.
Step 4
Configure a name for local SNMP engine on CSP.
Step 5
Exit global configuration mode.
Step 6
(Optional) Display the contact strings configured for the system using show running-config snmp-server contact command.
Step 7
(Optional) Display the location string configured for the system using show running-config snmp-server location command.
Step 8
(Optional) Display the identification of the local SNMP engine configured on CSP using show running-config snmp-server engineID command.
Configuring SNMP Notifications
Perform this task to configure the device to send traps or informs to CSP host.

Note
Many snmp-server commands use the keyword traps in their command syntax. Unless there is an option within the command to specify either traps or informs, the keyword traps should be taken to mean traps, informs, or both. Use the snmp-server host command to specify whether you want SNMP notifications to be sent as traps or informs.
Procedure
Step 1
Enter global configuration mode.
Step 2
Specify the name of a local copy of SNMP.
Step 3
Configure a local or remote user to be associated with the remote host created in Step 2.
Note 
You cannot configure a remote user for an address without first configuring the engine ID of the remote host. Otherwise, you receive an error message, and the command is not executed.
Step 4
Configure an SNMP group.
Step 5
Specify whether you want the SNMP notifications to be sent as traps or informs, the version of SNMP to use, the security level of the notifications (for SNMPv3), and the recipient (host) of the notifications.
The snmp-server host command specifies which hosts will receive SNMP notifications, and whether you want the notifications sent as traps or informs.
Step 6
Enable sending of general SNMP notifications.
Step 7
Exit global configuration mode.
Configuring SNMP Version 2
To configure SNMP version 2, do the following:
Procedure
Step 1
Use the default SNMP engine ID or modify the engine ID.
Note 
The engine ID can be modified only if you have not yet configured the SNMP community, group, or user. After configuring the SNMP community, group, or user, you cannot modify the engine ID.
Step 2
Create an SNMP community.
Step 3
Create an SNMP group with group version as 2 , group security level as noAuthNoPriv , and group context prefix as snmp .
The group context prefix must be specified as snmp . No other value is supported for group context prefix.
Step 4
Create an SNMP user. The name of this user must be exactly same as the community name created in Step 2 and the name of the user group must be exactly same as the group created in Step 3.
Configuring SNMP Version 3
To configure SNMP version 3, do the following:
Procedure
Step 1
Use the default SNMP engine ID or modify the engine ID.
Note 
The engine ID can be modified only if you have not yet configured the SNMP community, group, or user. After configuring the SNMP community, group, or user, you cannot modify the engine ID.
Step 2
Create an SNMP group with group version as 3 , group security level as authNoPriv or authPriv , and group context prefix.
Note 
Starting with Release 2.2.2, you can specify any group context prefix. You can also configure null context to run an SNMPv3 query without specifying the context name. To configure the null context, use the \"\" character sequence. In Release 2.2.1 and earlier releases, only snmp prefix is supported with SNMPv3.
Step 3
Create an SNMP user and specify the same group name as created in Step 2. In addition, specify the values for the following fields or parameters: auth-protocol (MD5 or SHA), priv-protocol (des or aes), and passphrase .

Managing User Accounts
Information About User Accounts
Cisco CSP supports the local and remote users. A local user is configured in the Cisco CSP and is authenticated by the Cisco CSP. A remote user is configured on a remote TACACS+ server and is authenticated by a configured TACACS+ server. If the same username is configured both locally and remotely, the remote TACACS+ server is used for authentication.

Note
Only local users can log in to Cisco CSP by using CIMC console. Remote TACACS+ users cannot log in to Cisco CSP by using CIMC console.
Supported User Groups
Cisco CSP provides the following user groups to configure role-based access control (RBAC):

Configuring Clusters
Guidelines for Cluster Configuration
The following are the guidelines and prerequisites for cluster configuration:
The CSP cluster is a GUI-only feature, where you can configure two or more CSP nodes in a single cluster up to a maximum of 10 nodes.
Cluster configuration through REST API and CLI are not supported for CSP version 2.5.0.
A cluster on CSP can only be configured by the local user, admin.
For every local user on cluster nodes, ensure that the passwords and usernames are same on every node in the cluster, otherwise cluster node creation or addition fails.
For external TACACS or RADIUS users, ensure that you configure the same TACACS or RADIUS on all cluster nodes. However, if you do not configure the same TACACS or RADIUS, the cluster node creation or addition does not fail.
Each CSP can be part of only one cluster at a time.
Ensure to configure NTP on all cluster members for the lifetime of the cluster and the clock timezone should be the same across all nodes.
To enable all cluster nodes share and access the same NFS storage, ensure to configure the NFS mount to the same storage location on all cluster nodes.
The CSP cluster can be modified from any node in the cluster after creation.
With the new cluster infrastructure, an upgrade from earlier CSP versions to CSP version 2.5.0 and later with cluster configured is not be supported. You must delete the existing cluster prior to upgrade and recreate it after upgrading to CSP, Release 2.5.0 and later.
All cluster members must be upgraded to the same version before starting to create a cluster.
The admin users and externally authenticated TACAS and RADIUS users can perform a file copy between cluster members.
The load option does not support adding cluster from configuration files prior to CSP, Release 2.5.0. Before loading the configuration, if the cluster configuration exists in the saved configuration file, the cluster configuration must be automatically deleted from the configuration file before applying it in 2.5.0 and later.
To change the management IP of a CSP node in the cluster, remove the node from the cluster, change the management IP and then add the node back to the cluster.
Ensure that each CSP node is reachable before and during cluster creation or addition of a node, otherwise the creation or addition process fails.
If the cluster state for members goes to a failed state, the cluster state can be stabilized by deleting the member that is in failed state or deleting the cluster and recreating it.
In a cluster with two members, if one of the members become unreachable, the cluster does not permit add operations. The cluster can recover either if the unreachable member becomes reachable, or if the cluster is deleted and reconfigured with another member.
If factory default reset or clean-install operations are executed on a member of a cluster, the cluster configuration gets cleaned up from that member. After that CSP is brought up and is running, no cluster configuration is present on it. On the other members of the cluster, the node is still present in the cluster with its cluster state as "not_present."
The new nodes can only be added to a cluster if every node is in "deployed" state. If the nodes are not in "deployed" state, the only delete cluster or delete node operations can be performed on a cluster.
For a cluster with two members, deleting one of the cluster members results in deletion of the entire cluster.
A cluster uses default CA certificates for HTTPS communication across cluster nodes. If desired, the default CA certificates can be replaced by custom certificate, however the infrastructure requires that every node in the cluster have the certificate generated from the same CA to ensure connectivity
If NAT is configured, ensure that only CSP management IP addresses are used to log in to the GUI. NAT addresses are not supported for cluster creation or modification operations.

Following are the guidelines for configuring the VM monitoring support:
VM IP config is mandatory if monitoring is enabled.
VM must have L3 connectivity from CSP management interface.
VM IP can be edited without powering off the VNF, whereas other VM monitoring parameters can be edited after powering off the VM.
VM monitoring can be paused or resumed for a VM that has monitoring enabled, and is powered on.
The monitoring status can be viewed in the services page on the web interface or the show service command on the CLI.
