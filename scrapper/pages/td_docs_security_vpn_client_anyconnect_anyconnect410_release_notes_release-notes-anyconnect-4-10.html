OCSP Check (Linux only)—Allows the client to query the status of individual certificates in realtime, by making a request to the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responder and parsing the OSCP response. This feature works only with PEM File Certificate Store. Refer to Root CA Conflict With Firefox NSS Store (Linux Only).
Before AnyConnect release 4.10.03104, Windows ADVERTISE installer action was not supported (CSCvw79615). With release 4.10.03104 and later, we provided a fix to successfully upgrade with Windows ADVERTISE for those with a lower version of AnyConnect. Consider however that future upgrades could still fail if AnyConnect version 4.10.02086 or earlier (as opposed to 4.10.03104 or later) is advertised.
Known Issues
CSCvy92621—posture-asa: AC Windows version incorrectly shows Windows 10 instead of Windows 11 with HS 10.02067
CSCvy92676—Posture-ISE: Windows 11 OS is showing as Windows 10 professional instead of Windows 11
CSCvz74755—Windows 11: Umbrella dashboard incorrectly displays OS version of Windows 11 client as 'Windows 10"
CSCvz74132—macOS 12; acumbrellaagent crash seen after OS update to beta7
CSCvz17505—Windows: Umbrella agent crash due to .NET/CLR exception in acumbrella plugin library
AnyConnect 4.10.02086 New Features
This is a maintenance release that includes the following features and support updates, and that resolves the defects described in AnyConnect 4.10.02086:
Linux enhancements to include client certificate store (in AnyConnect Profile Editor, Preferences: Part 1 and AnyConnect Profile Editor, Certificate Enrollment), related AnyConnect Local Policy profile additions, and options for configuring VPN access with multiple or basic certificate authentication.
Removal of Web Security module: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/cloud-web-security/eos-eol-notice-listing.html
AnyConnect VPN interoperability with VMware Fusion on macOS Big Sur (CSCvy10495)—VMware Fusion virtual machine connectivity with an AnyConnect VPN tunnel running on a macOS Big Sur host is possible, provided that at least restricted local LAN split exclude tunneling is enabled on the VPN headend. Refer to Connectivity Issues with VM-based Subsystems in the troubleshooting chapter of the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Administration Guide, Release 4.10 for further information. If a Fusion VM happens to be active during the AnyConnect installation (or an upgrade from version 4.10.01075 or earlier), either a reboot or Fusion restart is required after the AnyConnect installation, to restore the Fusion VM network connectivity. Subsequent AnyConnect upgrades do not require a reboot or restart.
Limited extended support for Windows 7 will be provided for customers who have active Windows 7 extended support contracts with Microsoft. Although Cisco no longer performs substantial quality assurance testing on Windows 7, issues will be resolved whenever possible. Cisco highly recommends upgrading to the latest version of AnyConnect and Windows to take advantage of security enhancements.
Native macOS arm64 Support—A single macOS installer supports both x86_64 and Apple Silicon (M1 chip) natively (without Rosetta). With this, all binaries moving forward will be Universal Binaries, including OPSWAT compliance modules. Therefore, OPSWAT compliance modules for macOS released prior to 4.3.1858.0 do not support Apple Silicon (M1 chip), where OPSWAT compliance modules 4.3.1858.0 and later support both Intel (x86_64) and Apple Silicon (M1 chip) devices. Due to this dynamic adoption in supporting Apple Silicon (M1 chip), macOS endpoints, using AnyConnect 4.10.02086 or later (and either ISE Posture or HostScan), must also upgrade their Posture Compliance Modules accordingly. The following chart outlines the minimum requirements:
AnyConnect Version
ISE Posture Compliance Library Minimum Version Supported/Required
HostScan Engine (.pkg) Minimum Version Supported/Required
4.10.01075 or earlier
macOS - all versions posted on CCO are supported. Most recently posted version is always suggested.
All versions posted on CCO are supported. Most recent HostScan .pkg that is posted is always suggested.
4.10.02086 or later
macOS - 4.3.1935.4353 or later is required
4.10.02086 or later is required. Most recent HostScan .pkg that is posted is always suggested.

Note
The above arm64 support is unrelated to the ISE 3.1 release.
Linux support for ISE Posture module.
Expansion of trust verification for ISE within the AnyConnect Local Policy Preferences setting. For script remediation, it is mandatory that you configure SHA256 fingerprints of any certificate in the ISE certification chain to establish ISE trust. Refer to Local Policy Preferences in the administration guide.
Script remediation messages were added to the ISE Posture Details and Cisco Secure Client Details.
Known Issues
CSCvz17505—Windows: Umbrella agent crash due to .NET/CLR exception in acumbrella plugin library
AnyConnect 4.10.01075 New Features
This is a maintenance release that includes the following features and support updates, and that resolves the defects described in AnyConnect 4.10.01075:
Added split DNS for split exclude tunneling (CSCuq89328)—When split DNS for split exclude tunneling is configured, specific DNS queries are sent outside the VPN tunnel, to a public DNS server. All othe DNS queries are tunneled to a VPN DNS server.
Added support for interoperability with VM-based subsystems (CSCvw81982)—Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) had connectivity issues with AnyConnect VPN active on a Windows 10 host. We addressed this issue by enhancing support for Local LAN wildcard split exclude tunneling, specifically by allowing the limiting of the Local LAN split exclude to virtual adapter subnets. Refer to Connectivity Issues With VM-Based Subsystems in the troubleshooting chapter of the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Administrator Guide, Release 4.10 for further information.
AnyConnect 4.10.00093 New Features
This is a major release that includes the following features and support updates, and that resolves the defects described in AnyConnect 4.10.00093:
Enhanced captive portal remediation now supported in macOS.
Architecture improvement of downloader to address local platform security concerns.
Ability to individually allow/disallow scripts, help, resources, or localization updates in Local Policy, while previously they were part of Allow Software Updates.
CiscoSSL changes: enable EMS for only TLS, and disable EMS for DTLS.
Operating system support has changed to eliminate older versions. Refer to AnyConnect Supported Operating Systems.
Revision to Linux requirements (due to Linux build toolchain/GTK migration). Refer to AnyConnect Support for Linux.
CSCvx78941—(Windows only) The product code signing certificate has been updated with a new certificate issued by DigiCert, instead of VeriSign. For code signatures to be verified and trusted by the OS, you must have the root certificate installed in the operating system's list of trusted root certificates. If Windows trusted root certificate updates are disabled, an AnyConnect install or upgrade may fail. If necessary, download and install the CN = DigiCert Assured ID Root CA root certificate from DigiCert into the Windows trusted root store (https://cacerts.digicert.com/DigiCertAssuredIDRootCA.crt.pem).

ISE Requirements for AnyConnect
Warning!
Incompatibility Warning: If you are an Identity Services Engine (ISE) customer running 2.0 (or later), you must read this before proceeding!
The ISE RADIUS has supported TLS 1.2 since release 2.0; however, there is a defect in the ISE implementation of EAP-FAST using TLS 1.2, tracked by CSCvm03681. The defect has been fixed in the 2.4p5 release of ISE. The fix will be made available in future hot patches for supported releases of ISE.
If Network Access Manager 4.7 (and later) is used to authenticate using EAP-FAST with any ISE releases that support TLS 1.2 prior to the above releases, the authentication will fail, and the endpoint will not have access to the network.
ISE 2.6 (and later) with AnyConnect 4.7MR1 (and later) supports IPv6 non-redirection flows (using stage 2 discovery) on wired and VPN flows.
AnyConnect temporal agent flows are working on IPv6 networks based on network topology. ISE supports multiple ways of IPv6 configuration on a network interface (for example, eth0/eth1).
IPv6 networks with regards to ISE posture flows have the following limitations: [IPv6] ISE posture discovery is in infinite loop due to specific type of network adapters (for example, Microsoft Teredo virtual adapter) (CSCvo36890).
ISE 2.0 is the minimum release capable of deploying AnyConnect software to an endpoint and posturing that endpoint using the new ISE Posture module in AnyConnect 4.0 and later.
ISE 2.0 can only deploy AnyConnect release 4.0 and later. Older releases of AnyConnect must be web deployed from an ASA, predeployed with an SMS, or manually deployed.
If you are installing or updating the AnyConnect ISE Posture module, the package and modules configured on ASA must be the same as the ones configured on ISE. VPN is always upgraded when other modules are upgraded, and a VPN module upgrade is not allowed from ISE when the tunnel is active.
ISE Licensing Requirements
To deploy AnyConnect from an ISE headend and use the ISE Posture module, a Cisco ISE Premier License is required on the ISE Administration node. For detailed ISE license information, see the Cisco ISE Licenses chapter of the Cisco Identity Services Engine Admin Guide.
Secure Firewall ASA Requirements for AnyConnect
Minimum ASA/ASDM Release Requirements for Specified Features
You must upgrade to Secure Firewall ASA 9.10.1 (or later) and ASDM 7.10.1 (or later) to use DTLSv1.2.

Note
DTLSv1.2 is supported on all Secure Firewall ASA models except the 5506-X, 5508-X, and 5516-X and applies when the ASA is acting as a server only, not a client. DTLS 1.2 supports additional ciphers, as well as all current TLS/DTLS ciphers and a larger cookie size.
You must upgrade to ASDM 7.10.1 to use management VPN tunnel.
You must upgrade to ASDM 7.5.1 to use Network Visibility Module.
You must upgrade to ASDM 7.4.2 to use AMP Enabler.
You must upgrade to Secure Firewall ASA 9.3(2) to use TLS 1.2.
You must upgrade to Secure Firewall ASA 9.2(1) if you want to use the following features:
ISE Posture over VPN
ISE Deployment of AnyConnect
Change of Authorization (CoA) on ASA is supported from this version onwards
You must upgrade to Secure Firewall ASA 9.0 if you want to use the following features:
IPv6 support
Cisco Next Generation Encryption “Suite-B” security
Dynamic Split Tunneling(Custom Attributes)
AnyConnect deferred upgrades
Management VPN Tunnel (Custom Attributes)
You must use Secure Firewall ASA 8.4(1) or later if you want to do the following:
Use IKEv2.
Use the ASDM to edit non-VPN client profiles (such as Network Access Manager).
Deploy firewall rules. If you deploy always-on VPN, you might want to enable split tunneling and configure firewall rules to restrict network access to local printing and tethered mobile devices.
Configure dynamic access policies or group policies to exempt qualified VPN users from an always-on VPN deployment.
Configure dynamic access policies to display a message on the AnyConnect GUI when an AnyConnect session is in quarantine.
To perform the HostScan migration from 4.3x to 4.6.x, ASDM 7.9.2 or later is required.
Secure Firewall ASA Memory Requirements

Caution
The minimum flash memory recommended for all Secure Firewall ASA models using AnyConnect is 512MB. This will allow hosting of multiple endpoint operating systems, and logging and debugging to be enabled on the ASA.
Due to flash size limitations on the Secure Firewall ASA (maximum of 128 MB), not all permutations of the AnyConnect package will be able to be loaded onto this model. To successfully load AnyConnect, you will need to reduce the size of your packages (such as fewer OSs, no HostScan, and so on) until they fit on the available flash.
Check for the available space before proceeding with the AnyConnect install or upgrade. You can use one of the following methods to do so:
CLI—Enter the show memory command.
asa3# show memory 
Free memory:       304701712 bytes (57%)
Used memory:       232169200 bytes (43%)
-------------     ----------------
Total memory:      536870912 bytes (100%)
ASDM—Choose Tools > File Management. The File Management window displays flash space.
If your Secure Firewall ASA has only the default internal flash memory size or the default DRAM size (for cache memory), you could have problems storing and loading multiple AnyConnect packages on the ASA. Even if you have enough space on the flash to hold the package files, the Secure Firewall ASA could run out of cache memory when it unzips and loads the client images. For additional information about the ASA memory requirements and upgrading ASA memory, see the latest release notes for the Cisco ASA.
HostScan
AnyConnect 4.10.x clients must use Secure Firewall Posture 5.0 (or later) or HostScan 4.10.x.

Note
AnyConnect 4.10.x will not establish a VPN connection when used with an incompatible version of HostScan. Therefore, if you are using a HostScan version prior to 4.10.x, you must upgrade to Secure Firewall Posture 5.0.x (or later) or HostScan 4.10.x. We always recommend that you upgrade to the latest version available for download on CCO.
If you are currently using HostScan 4.3.x or earlier, a one-time HostScan migration must be performed prior to upgrading to any newer version of HostScan. Refer to the AnyConnect HostScan Migration 4.3.x to 4.6.x and Later documentation for the specifics of how to do this migration.
Also, Cisco does not recommend the combined use of HostScan and ISE posture. Unexpected results occur when the two different posture agents are run.
The HostScan Module provides AnyConnect the ability to identify the operating system, antimalware, and firewall software installed on the host to the Secure Firewall ASA.
When using Start Before Login (SBL) and HostScan, you must install the AnyConnect predeploy module on the endpoints to achieve full HostScan functionality, since SBL is pre-login.
With HostScan, macOS Big Sur (version 11.x) is officially supported. Therefore, if you are using macOS Big Sur beta or the official macOS Big Sur (version 11.x) release with HostScan, the HostScan Module (if previously installed) on the endpoint and the HostScan package on the Secure Firewall ASA must be upgraded to 4.9.04045 or later.
Due to this dynamic adoption in supporting Apple Silicon (M1 chip), macOS endpoints using AnyConnect 4.10.02086 or later must also upgrade the HostScan package version to 4.10.02086 or later. The following chart outlines the minimum requirements:
AnyConnect Version
HostScan Engine (.pkg) Minimum Version Supported/Required
4.10.01075 or earlier
All versions posted on CCO are supported. The most recent HostScan.pkg that is posted is always suggested.
4.10.02086 or later
4.10.02086 or later is required. The most recent HostScan .pkg that is posted is always suggested.
When using Start Before Login (SBL) and Secure Firewall Posture, you must install the Cisco Secure Client predeploy module on the endpoints to achieve full Secure Firewall Posture functionality, since SBL is pre-login.
The HostScan Antimalware and Firewall Support Charts are available on cisco.com.
Notice of End Date for HostScan 4.3.x
End of Support (EOS) for HostScan 4.3.x was announced December 31, 2018. If you are currently using HostScan 4.3.x or earlier, a one-time HostScan migration must be performed prior to upgrading to any newer version of HostScan. Refer to the AnyConnect HostScan Migration 4.3.x to 4.6.x and Later documentation for the specifics of how to do this migration.
ISE Posture Compliance Module
(CSCwa91572) For compatibility and ease of deployment, you must use the following Compliance Modules with Cisco Secure Client version 5.0.01242 and later: Windows version 4.3.2755, macOS version 4.3.2379, and Linux version 4.3.2063. Also, already released Compliance Modules are not supported for Cisco Secure Client version 5.0.01242 (and later) builds.
(CSCvy53730-Windows only) As of AnyConnect 4.9.06037, the Compliance Modules from ISE cannot be updated. Due to this change, Compliance Module version 4.3.1634.6145 or later are required for AnyConnect 4.9.06037 (and above) and Cisco Secure Client 5 (up to 5.0.01242).
The ISE Posture compliance module contains the list of supported antimalware and firewall for ISE posture. While the HostScan list is organized by vendor, the ISE posture list organizes by product type. When the version number on the headend (ISE or Secure Firewall ASA) is greater than the version on the endpoint, the OPSWAT gets updated. These upgrades are mandatory and happen automatically without end user intervention.
The individual files within the library (a zip file) are digitally signed by OPSWAT, Inc., and the library itself is packaged as a single, self-extracting executable which is code signed by a Cisco certificate. Refer to the ISE compliance modules for details.
IOS Support of AnyConnect
Cisco supports AnyConnect VPN access to IOS Release 15.1(2)T functioning as the secure gateway; however, IOS Release 15.1(2)T does not currently support the following AnyConnect features:
Post Log-in Always-on VPN
Connect Failure Policy
Client Firewall providing Local Printer and Tethered Device access
Optimal Gateway Selection
Quarantine
AnyConnect Profile Editor
DTLSv1.2
For additional limitations of IOS support for AnyConnect VPN, please see Features Not Supported on the Cisco IOS SSL VPN.
Refer to http://www.cisco.com/go/fn for additional IOS feature support information.

AnyConnect Support for Microsoft Windows
Windows Requirements
Pentium class processor or greater.
100 MB hard disk space.
Microsoft Installer, version 3.1.
Upgrading to Windows 8.1 from any previous Windows release requires you to uninstall AnyConnect, and reinstall it after your Windows upgrade is complete.
Upgrading from Windows XP to any later Windows release requires a clean install since the AnyConnect Virtual Adapter is not preserved during the upgrade. Manually uninstall AnyConnect, upgrade Windows, then reinstall AnyConnect manually or via WebLaunch.
To start AnyConnect with WebLaunch, you must use the 32-bit version of Firefox 3.0+ and enable ActiveX or install Sun JRE 1.4+.
ASDM version 7.02 or higher is required when using Windows 8 or 8.1.
Windows Limitations
Before AnyConnect release 4.10.03104, Windows ADVERTISE installer action was not supported (CSCvw79615). With release 4.10.03104 and later, we provided a fix to successfully upgrade with Windows ADVERTISE for those with a lower version of AnyConnect. Consider however that future upgrades could still fail if AnyConnect version 4.10.02086 or earlier (as opposed to 4.10.03104 or later) is advertised.
AnyConnect is not supported on Windows RT. There are no APIs provided in the operating system to implement this functionality. Cisco has an open request with Microsoft on this topic. Those who want this functionality should contact Microsoft to express their interest.
Other third-party product’s incompatibility with Windows 8 prevent AnyConnect from establishing a VPN connection over wireless networks. Here are two examples of this problem:
WinPcap service “Remote Packet Capture Protocol v.0 (experimental)” distributed with Wireshark does not support Windows 8.
To work around this problem, uninstall Wireshark or disable the WinPcap service, reboot your Windows 8 computer, and attempt the AnyConnect connection again.
Outdated wireless cards or wireless card drivers that do not support Windows 8 prevent AnyConnect from establishing a VPN connection.
To work around this problem, make sure you have the latest wireless network cards or drivers that support Windows 8 installed on your Windows 8 computer.
AnyConnect is not integrated with the new UI framework, known as the Metro design language, that is deployed on Windows 8; however, AnyConnect does run on Windows 8 in desktop mode.
HP Protect tools do not work with AnyConnect on Windows 8.x.
If you are using Network Access Manager on a system that supports standby, Cisco recommends that the default Windows 8.x association timer value (5 seconds) is used. If you find the Scanlist in Windows appears shorter than expected, increase the association timer so that the driver can complete a network scan and populate the scanlist.
Windows Guidelines
Verify that the driver on the client system is supported by your Windows version. Drivers that are not supported may have intermittent connection problems.
For Network Access Manager, machine authentication using machine password will not work on Windows 8 or 10 / Server 2012 unless a registry fix described in Microsoft KB 2743127 is applied to the client desktop. This fix includes adding a DWORD value LsaAllowReturningUnencryptedSecrets to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa registry key and setting this value to 1.
Machine authentication using machine certificate (rather than machine password) does not require a change and is the more secure option. Because machine password was accessible in an unencrypted format, Microsoft changed the OS so that a special key was required. Network Access Manager cannot know the password established between the operating system and active directory server and can only obtain it by setting the key above. This change permits Local Security Authority (LSA) to provide clients like Cisco Network Access Manager with the machine password.

Note
Machine authentication allows a client desktop to be authenticated to the network before the user logs in. During this time the administrator can perform scheduled administrative tasks for this client machine. Machine authentication is also required for the EAP Chaining feature where a RADIUS server can authenticate both the User and Machine for a particular client. This will result in identifying company assets and applying appropriate access policies. For example, if this is a personal asset (PC/laptop/tablet), and corporate credentials are used, the endpoint will fail Machine authentication, but succeed User authentication, and the proper network access restrictions are applied to the user's network connection.
On Windows 8, the Export Stats button on the Preferences > VPN > Statistics tab saves the file on the desktop. In other versions of Windows, the user is asked where to save the file.
AnyConnect VPN is compatible with 3G/4G/5G data cards which interface with Windows via a WWAN adapter.

AnyConnect Licensing
For the latest end-user license agreement, see Cisco End User License Agreement, AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.
For our open source licensing acknowledgments, see Open Source Software Used in AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.
To deploy AnyConnect from an ISE headend and use the ISE Posture module, a Cisco ISE Premier License is required on the ISE Administration node. For detailed ISE license information, see the Cisco ISE Licenses chapter of the Cisco Identity Services Engine.
To deploy AnyConnect from a Secure Firewall ASA headend and use the VPN and HostScan modules, an Advantage or Premier license is required. Trial licenses are available. See the AnyConnect Ordering Guide.
For an overview of the Advantage and Premier licenses and a description of which license the features use, see AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Features, Licenses, and OSs.
AnyConnect Installation Overview
Deploying AnyConnect refers to installing, configuring, and upgrading the AnyConnect and its related files. The AnyConnect can be deployed to remote users by the following methods:
Predeploy—New installations and upgrades are done either by the end user, or by using an enterprise software management system (SMS).
Web Deploy—The AnyConnect package is loaded on the headend, which is either a Secure Firewall ASA or ISE server. When the user connects to a Secure Firewall ASA or to ISE, AnyConnect is deployed to the client.
For new installations, the user connects to a headend to download AnyConnect. The client is either installed manually, or automatically (web-launch).
Updates are done by AnyConnect running on a system where AnyConnect is already installed, or by directing the user to the Secure Firewall ASA clientless portal.
Cloud Update—After the Umbrella Roaming Security module is deployed, you can update any AnyConnect modules using one of the above methods, as well as Cloud Update. With Cloud Update, the software upgrades are obtained automatically from the Umbrella cloud infrastructure, and the update track is dependent upon that and not any action of the administrator. By default, automatic updates from Cloud Update are disabled.
When you deploy AnyConnect, you can include the optional modules that enable extra features, and client profiles that configure the VPN and other features. Keep in mind the following:
All AnyConnect modules and profiles can be predeployed. When predeploying, you must pay special attention to the module installation sequence and other details.
The Customer Experience Feedback module and the HostScan package, used by the VPN Posture module, cannot be web deployed from the ISE.
The Compliance Module, used by the ISE Posture module, cannot be web deployed from the Secure Firewall ASA.

Note
Make sure to update the localization MST files with the latest release from CCO whenever you upgrade to a new AnyConnect package.
Web-based Installation May Fail on 64-bit Windows
This issue applies to Internet Explorer versions 10 and 11, on Windows 8.
When the Windows registry entry HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\TabProcGrowth is set to 0, Active X has problems during AnyConnect web deployment.
See http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2716529 for more information.
The solution to is to:
Run a 32-bit version of Internet Explorer.
Edit the registry entry to a non-zero value, or remove that value from the registry.

Note
On Windows 8, starting Internet Explorer from the Windows start screen runs the 64-bit version. Starting from the desktop runs the 32-bit version.
AnyConnect Support Policy
Cisco only provides fixes and enhancements based on the most recent Version 4.10 release. TAC support is available to any customer with an active AnyConnect Version 4.10 term/contract running a released version of AnyConnect Version 4.10. If you experience a problem with an out-of-date software version, you may be asked to validate whether the current maintenance release resolves your issue.
Software Center access is limited to AnyConnect Version 4.10 versions with current fixes. We recommend that you download all images for your deployment, as we cannot guarantee that the version you are looking to deploy will still be available for download at a future date.
Guidelines and Limitations
VPN Headend DNS Load Balancing Not Supported
AnyConnect supports DNS load balancing using SAML authentication for an embedded browser. Using Secure Firewall ASA, Secure Firewall Threat Defense, or other headends and an external/native browser, VPN headend DNS load balancing is not supported due to operating system limitations, which restrict the ability for Cisco Secure Client to control the necessary underlying conditions.
macOS 13 Known Issue
Continuity Camera in macOS 13 is currently not functioning during an active VPN connection.
Simultaneous VPN Sessions Not Supported
AnyConnect VPN cannot be active at the same time as any other client VPN, either Cisco software like the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Universal Windows Platform or third-party VPNs.
DNS (Name Resolution) on macOS 12.x May Fail
Those running AnyConnect on macOS 12.x may experience a loss of DNS (name resolution), requiring a reboot for restoration. The cause has been identified as a macOS bug, which has been addressed in macOS 12.3 (FB9803355).
Windows Local Group Policy DNS Settings Ignored
Global DNS settings Searchlist and UseDomainNameDevolution are used by AnyConnect to build the DNS suffix search list for a VPN connection. Any overrides configured via local group policy will be ignored.
Encrypted DNS Impact and Mitigation
Encrypted Domain Name System (DNS) resolution impacts AnyConnect functionality, namely network flows targeting FQDNs resolved via encrypted DNS either circumvent or are not properly handled by the following AnyConnect features: Umbrella DNS protection, Umbrella web protection (when name-based redirect rules are used), VPN (dynamic split tunneling and Always On with name-based exceptions), Network Visibility (reporting of peer FQDN). To mitigate this impact, you should disable encrypted DNS in browser settings pertaining to AnyConnect users.
As an additional mitigation, AnyConnect prohibits DNS over HTTPS (DoH) name resolution for the Windows DNS client via local policy setting Configure DNS over HTTP (DoH) name resolution (under Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Network > DNS Client). This change is applicable to Windows 11 and later versions and is enforced while any of the following modules is active: VPN, Umbrella Roaming Security, or Network Visibility. AnyConnect does not alter this policy setting if a conflicting setting of higher precedence (for example, domain GPO setting) is detected.
Limitations When Using RPM/DEB Installer
When using an RPM/DEB installer to upgrade from the version installed by the script, the following limitations exist:
Automatic client update from headend is not supported. You must do updates out-of-band with a system package manager.
The only AnyConnect modules supported with RPM and DEB installers are VPN and DART.
You must uninstall current existing AnyConnect (including all modules) before switching to use RPM or DEB installer. See CSCwa16755 for the workaround to a known issue.
You cannot use a script installer to update an existing RPM or DEB installation.
Root CA Conflict With Firefox NSS Store (Linux Only)
When a root certificate authority (CA) is public trusted, it is already in the File Certificate Store. However, if the Firefox NSS store is left enabled at the same time, the OCSP check might be bypassed, as we only support OCSP check with File Cert Store. To prevent this bypass, disable Firefox NSS store by setting ExcludeFirefoxNSSCertStore to true in the local policy file.
Initiating an Automatic VPN Connection With TND (CSCvz02896)
When using Trusted Network Detection, the automatic VPN connection may not be initiated according to the TND policy, if the system route table does not contain a default route.
AnyConnect 4.10 Upgrade Failure on Linux (Only AnyConnect Versions Prior to 4.9.01095)
If you are using web deploy to upgrade to AnyConnect or HostScan 4.10 from a version prior to 4.9.01095, an error could result. Since AnyConnect versions prior to 4.9.01095 did not have the capacity to parse the system CA store, the result is an upgrade failure, because the correct NSS certificate store path could not be determined in the user's profile directory. If you are upgrading to AnyConnect 4.10 from a release prior to 4.9.01095, copy the root certificate (DigiCertAssuredIDRootCA.pem) to /opt/.cisco/certificates/ca prior to upgrading AnyConnect on the endpoint.
NVM Installation Fails With Ubuntu 20
If you are using Ubuntu 20.04 (which has kernel version 5.4), you must use AnyConnect 4.8 (or later), or Network Visibility Module installation fails.
Local and Network Proxy Incompatibilities
Local and/or network proxies (such as software/security applications like Fiddler, Charles Proxy, or Third-party Antimalware/Security software that includes Web HTTP/HTTPS inspection and/or decryption capabilities) are not compatible with AnyConnect.
Web Deployment Workflow Limitations on Linux
Consider these two limitations when doing a web deployment on Linux:
The Ubuntu NetworkManager Connectivity Checking functionality allows periodic testing, whether the internet can be accessed or not. Because Connectivity Checking has its own prompt, you can receive a network logon window if a network without internet connectivity is detected. To avoid such network prompts, that aren’t tied to a browser window and don't have download capability, you should disable Connectivity Checking in Ubuntu 17 and beyond. By disabling, the user will be able to download a file from the ISE portal using a browser for ISE-based AnyConnect web deployment.
Before doing a web deploy onto a Linux endpoint, you must disable access control with the xhost+ command. Xhost controls the access of a remote host running a terminal on the endpoint, which is restricted by default. Without disabling access control, AnyConnect web deployment fails.
Client First Auto-Reconnect Unsuccessful After Upgrading to AnyConnect 4.9.01xxx (Linux Only)
With the fix of CSCvu65566 and its device ID computation change, certain deployments of Linux (particularly those that use LVM) experience a one-time connection attempt error immediately after updating from a headend to 4.9.01xxx or later. Linux users running AnyConnect 4.8 (and later) and connecting to a headend to perform an auto update (web-deploy) may receive this error: "The secure gateway has rejected the connection attempt. A new connection attempt to the same or another secure gateway is needed, which requires re-authentication." To successfully connect, you can manually initiate another VPN connection after AnyConnect upgrade. After an initial upgrade to 4.9.01xxx or later, you will no longer hit this issue.
Potential Issues Connecting to a Wireless Network After An Upgrade from AnyConnect 4.7MR4
The Network Access Manager made a revision to write wireless LAN profiles to disk rather than just using temporary profiles in memory. Microsoft requested this change to address an OS bug, but it resulted in a crash of the Wireless LAN Data Usage window and eventual intermittent wireless connectivity issues. To prevent these issues, we reverted the Network Access Manager to using the original temporary WLAN profiles in memory. The Network Access Manager removes most of the wireless LAN profiles on disk when upgrading to version 4.8MR2 or later. Some hard profiles cannot be removed by the OS WLAN service when directed, but any remaining interfere with the ability for the Network Access Manager to connect to wireless networks. Follow these steps if you experience problems connecting to a wireless network after an upgrade from 4.7MR4 to 4.8MR2:
Stop the AnyConnect Network Access Manager service.
From the administrator command prompt, enter
netsh wlan delete profile name=*(AC)
This removes leftover profiles from previous versions (AnyConnect 4.7MR4 to 4.8MR2). Alternatively, you can look for profiles with AC appended to the name and delete them from the native supplicant.
Nslookup Command Needs macOS Fix To Work As Expected
macOS 11 fixed an issue seen in AnyConnect version 4.8.03036 (and later) related to the nslookup command, namely nslookup not sending DNS queries through the VPN tunnel with split-include tunneling configuration. The issue initiated in AnyConnect 4.8.03036 when that version included a fix for defect CSCvo18938. The Apple-suggested changes for that defect ended up revealing another OS issue, causing the nslookup problematic behavior.
As a workaround for macOS 10.x, you can pass the VPN DNS server as a parameter to nslookup: nslookup [name] [ip_dnsServer_vpn].
Server Certificate Validation Error
(CSCvu71024) AnyConnect authentication may fail if the Secure Firewall ASA headend or SAML provider uses certificates signed by the AddTrust root (or one of the intermediaries), because they expired in May 2020. The expired certificate causes AnyConnect to fail and presents as a server certificate validation error, until operating systems make the required updates to accommodate the May 2020 expiration.
Windows DNS Client Optimizations Caveat
Windows DNS Client optimizations present in Windows 8 and above may result in failure to resolve certain domain names when split DNS is enabled. The workaround is to disable such optimizations by updating the following registry keys:
Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Dnscache\Parameters
Value:DisableParallelAandAAAA
Data: 1
Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\DNSClient
Value: DisableSmartNameResolution
Data: 1
Preparation for macOS 10.15 Users
The macOS 10.15 operating system does not support 32-bit binaries. Additionally, Apple verifies that all software installed on 10.15 has been cryptographically notarized via digital signature. From AnyConnect 4.8 and later, operation on macOS 10.15 is supported with no 32-bit code.
Make note of these limitations:
AnyConnect versions prior to 4.7.03052 may require an active internet connection to upgrade.
HostScan versions prior to 4.8.x will not function on macOS 10.15.
HostScan and System Scan users on macOS 10.15 will experience permission popups during initial launch.
HostScan Will Not Function With macOS 10.15 Without Upgrade (CSCvq11813)
HostScan packages earlier than 4.8.x will not function with macOS Catalina (10.15). End users who attempt to connect from macOS Catalina to Secure Firewall ASA headends running HostScan packages earlier than 4.8.x will not be able to successfully complete VPN connections, receiving a posture assessment failed message.
AnyConnect 4.10.x clients on macOS Big Sur (11.x) must use HostScan 4.9.04045 or later.
To enable successful VPN connections for HostScan users, all DAP and HostScan policies must be HostScan 4.8.00175 (or later) compatible. Refer to AnyConnect HostScan Migration 4.3.x to 4.6.x and Later for additional information related to policy migration from HostScan 4.3.x to 4.8.x.
As a workaround to restore VPN connectivity, administrators of systems with HostScan packages on their Secure Firewall ASA headends may disable HostScan. If disabled, allHostScan posture functionality, and DAP policies that depend on endpoint information, will be unavailable.

Permission Popups During Initial HostScan or System Scan Launch (CSCvq64942)
macOS 10.15 (and later) requires that applications obtain user permissions for access to Desktop, Documents, Downloads, and Network Volume folders. To grant this access, you may see popups during an initial launch of HostScan, System Scan (when ISE posture is enabled on the network), or DART (when ISE posture or AnyConnect is installed). ISE posture and HostScan use OPSWAT for posture assessment on endpoints, and the posture checks access these folders based on the product and policies configured.
At these popups, you must click OK to have access to these folders and to continue with the posture flow. If you click Don't Allow, the endpoint may not remain compliant, and the posture assessment and remediation may fail without access to these folders.
To Remedy a Don't Allow Selection
To see these popups again and grant access to the folders, edit cached settings:
Open System Preferences.
Navigate to Security & Privacy > Privacy > Files and Folders > .
Delete folder access related cache details in the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client folder.
The permission popups will reappear with a subsequent start of posture, and the user can click OK to grant access.
GUI Customization on macOS Not Supported
GUI resource customization on macOS is currently not supported.
Incompatibility with SentinelOne
AnyConnect Umbrella module is incompatible with SentinelOne endpoint security software.
macOS Management Tunnel Disconnect After Upgrade to 4.8
If you encounter any of the following scenarios, it is related to security improvements to comply with Apple notarizations:
You had management tunnel connectivity with AnyConnect 4.7, but the AnyConnect 4.8 version fails in the same environment.
The VPN statistic window displays "Disconnect (Connect Failed)" as the management tunnel state.
Console logs indicate "Certificate Validation Failure," signifying a management tunnel disconnect.
If configured to allow access (without prompting) to the AnyConnect app or executables, ACLs must be reconfigured after upgrading to AnyConnect 4.8 (or later), by re-adding the app or executable. You must change the private key access in the system store of the keychain access to include the vpnagentd process:
Navigate to System Keychain > System > My Certificates > Private key.
Remove the vpnagentd process from the access control tab.
Add the current vpnagentd into the /opt/cisco/anyconnect/bin folder.
Enter the password when prompted.
Quit Keychain Access and stop the VPN service.
Restart.
No Detection of Default Patch Management in ISE Posture (CSCvq64901)
ISE posture failed to detect the default Patch Management while using macOS 10.15. An OPSWAT fix is required to remedy this situation.
PMK-Based Roaming Not Supported With Network Access Manager
You cannot use PMK-based roaming with Network Access Manager on Windows.
DART Requires Admin Privileges
Due to system security restrictions, DART now requires administrator privileges on macOS, Ubuntu, and Red Hat to collect logs.
Restored IPsec Connections in FIPS Mode (CSCvm87884)
AnyConnect releases 4.6.2 and 4.6.3 had IPsec connection issues. With the restoration of the IPsec connection (CSCvm87884) in AnyConnect release 4.7 (and later), Diffie-Hellman groups 2 and 5 in FIPS mode are no longer supported. Therefore, AnyConnect in FIPS mode can no longer connect to Secure Firewall ASA prior to release 9.6 and with configuration dictating DH groups 2 or 5.
Changes with Certificate Store Database (NSS Library Updates) on Firefox58
(Only Impacting users using Firefox prior to 58) Due to the NSS certificate store DB format change starting with Firefox 58, AnyConnect also made the change to use new certificate DB. If using Firefox version prior to 58, set NSS_DEFAULT_DB_TYPE="sql" environment variable to 58 to ensure Firefox and AnyConnect are accessing the same DB files.
Conflict with Network Access Manager and Group Policy
If your wired or wireless network settings or specific SSIDs are pushed from a Windows group policy, they can conflict with the proper operation of the Network Access Manager. With the Network Access Manager installed, a group policy for wireless settings is not supported.
No Hidden Network Scanlist on Network Access Manager with Windows 10 Version 1703 (CSCvg04014)
Windows 10 version 1703 changed their WLAN behavior, which caused disruptions when the Network Access Manager scans for wireless network SSIDs. Because of a bug with the Windows code that Microsoft is investigating, the Network Access Manager's attempt to access hidden networks is impacted. To provide the best user experience, we have disabled Microsoft's new functionality by setting two registry keys during Network Access Manager installation and removing them during an uninstall.
AnyConnect macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) Compatibility
AnyConnect 4.5.02XXX and later has additional functionality and warnings to guide users through the steps needed to leverage complete capabilities, by enabling the Secure Client, formerly AnyConnect, software extension in their macOS Preferences -> Security & Privacy pane. The requirement to manually enable the software extension is a new operating system requirement in macOS 10.13 (High Sierra). Additionally, if AnyConnect is upgraded before a user’s system is upgraded to macOS 10.13 and later, the user will automatically have the AnyConnect software extension enabled.
Users running macOS 10.13 (and later) with a version earlier than 4.5.02XXX must enable the Secure Client, formerly AnyConnect, software extension in their macOS Preferences -> Security & Privacy pane. You may need to manually reboot after enabling the extension.
As described in https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208019, macOS system administrators potentially have additional capabilities to disable User Approved Kernel Extension Loading, which would be effective with any currently supported version of AnyConnect.
Impact on Posture When a Power Event or Network Interruption Occurs
If a network change or power event occurs, a posture process that is interrupted will not complete successfully. The network or power change results in the AnyConnect downloader error that must be acknowledged by the user before continuing the process.
Network Access Manager Does Not Automatically Fallback to WWAN/3G/4G/5G
All connections to WWAN/3G/4G/5G must be manually triggered by the user. The Network Access Manager does NOT automatically connect to these networks if no wired or wireless connection is available.
Web Deploy of NAM, DART, ISE Posture, and/or Posture Fails with Signature/File Integrity Verification Error
A "timestamp signature and/or certificate could not be verified or is malformed" error only occurs on Windows during web deploy of AnyConnect 4.4MR2 (or later) from Secure Firewall ASA or ISE. Only the Network Access Manager, DART, ISE Posture, and Posture modules that are deployed as MSI files are affected. Because of the use of SHA-2 timestamping certificate service, the most up-to-date trusted root certificates are required to properly validate the timestamp certificate chain. You will not have this issue with predeploy or an out-of-the-box Windows system configured to automatically update root certificates. However, if the automatic root certificate update setting has been disabled (not the default), refer to https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn265983(v=ws.11).aspx or manually install the timestamping root certificates that we use. You can also use the signtool to verify if the issue is outside of AnyConnect by running the
signtool.exe verify /v /all/debug/pa<file to verify> 
command from a Microsoft provided Windows SDK.
macOS Keychain Prompts During Authentication
On macOS, a keychain authentication prompt may appear after the VPN connection is initiated. The prompt only occurs when access to a client certificate private key is necessary, after a client certificate request from the secure gateway. Even if the tunnel group is not configured with certificate authentication, certificate mapping may be configured on the Secure Firewall ASA, causing the keychain prompts when the access control setting for the client certificate private key is configured as Confirm Before Allowing Access.
Configure the AnyConnect profile to restrict AnyConnect access strictly to clients certificates from the login keychain (in the ASDM profile editor, choose Login under Preferences (Part 1) - Certificate Store - macOS). You can stop the keychain authentication prompts with one of the following actions:
Configure the certificate matching criteria in the client profile to exclude well-known system keychain certificates.
Configure the access control setting for the client certificate private keys in the system keychain to allow access to AnyConnect.
Umbrella Roaming Security Module Changes
The dashboard to retrieve the OrgInfo.json file is https://dashboard.umbrella.com. From there you navigate to Identities > Roaming Computers, click the + (Add icon) in the upper left, and click Module Profile from the AnyConnect Umbrella Roaming Security Module section.
Microsoft Inadvertently Blocks Updates to Windows 10 When Network Access Manager is Installed
Microsoft intended to block updates to earlier versions of Windows when the Network Access Manager is installed, but Windows 10 and Creators Edition (RS2) were inadvertently blocked as well. Because of the error (Microsoft Sysdev 11911272), you must first uninstall the Network Access Manager module before you can upgrade to the Creators Editor (RS2). You can then reinstall the module after the upgrade. Microsoft's fix for this error is planned for June 2017.
Windows 10 Defender False Positive─Cisco AnyConnect Adapter Issue
When upgrading to Windows 10 Creator Update (April 2017), you may encounter a Windows Defender message that the AnyConnect adapter has an issue. Windows Defender instructs you to enable the adapter under the Device Performance and Health section. In actuality, the adapter should be disabled when not in use, and no manual action should be taken. This false positive error has been reported to Microsoft under Sysdev # 11295710.
AnyConnect 4.4MR1 (or later) and 4.3MR5 are compatible with Windows 10 Creators Edition (RS2).
AnyConnect Compatibility with Microsoft Windows 10
For best results, we recommend a clean install of AnyConnect on a Windows 10 system and not an upgrade from Windows 7/8/8.1. If you are planning to perform an upgrade from Windows 7/8/8.1 with AnyConnect pre-installed, make sure that you first upgrade AnyConnect prior to uprading the operating system. The Network Access Manager Module must be uninstalled prior to upgrading to Windows 10. After the system upgrade is complete, you can re-install Network Access Manager on the system. You may also choose to fully uninstall AnyConnect and re-install one of the supported versions after upgrading to Windows 10.
New Split Include Tunnel Behavior (CSCum90946)
Formerly, if a split-include network was a Supernet of a Local Subnet, the local subnet traffic was not tunneled unless a split-include network that exactly matches the Local Subnet was configured. With the resolution of CSCum90946, when a split-include network is a Supernet of a Local Subnet, the Local Subnet traffic is tunneled, unless a split-exclude (deny 0.0.0.0/32 or ::/128) is also configured in the access-list (ACE/ACL).
The following configuration is required when a Supernet is configured in the split-include and the desired behavior is to allow LocalLan access:
access-list (ACE/ACL) must include both a permit action for the Supernet and a deny action for 0.0.0.0/32 or ::/128.
Enable Local LAN Access in the AnyConnect profile (in the Preferences Part 1 menu) of the profile editor. (You also have the option to make it user controllable.)
Microsoft Phasing out SHA-1 Support
A secure gateway with a SHA-1 certificate or a certificate with SHA-1 intermediate certificates may no longer be considered valid by a Windows Internet Explorer 11 / Edge browser or a Windows AnyConnect endpoint after February 14, 2017. After February 14, 2017, Windows endpoints may no longer consider a secure gateway with a SHA-1 certificate or intermediate certificate as trusted. We highly recommend that your secure gateway does not have a SHA-1 identity certificate and that any intermediate certificates are not SHA-1.
Microsoft has made modifications to their original plan of record and timing. They have published details for how to test whether your environment will be impacted by their February 2017 changes. Cisco is not able to make any guarantees of correct AnyConnect operation for customers with SHA-1 secure gateway or intermediate certificates or running old versions of AnyConnect.
Cisco highly recommends that customers stay up to date with the current maintenance release of AnyConnect in order to ensure that they have all available fixes in place. The most up-to-date version of AnyConnect 4.x and beyond are available Cisco.com Software Center for customers with active AnyConnect Plus, Apex, and VPN Only terms/contracts. AnyConnect Version 3.x is no longer actively maintained and should no longer be used for any deployments.

Note
Cisco has validated that AnyConnect 4.3 and 4.4 (and beyond) releases will continue to operate correctly as Microsoft further phases out SHA-1. Long term, Microsoft intends to distrust SHA-1 throughout Windows in all contexts, but their current advisory does not provide any specifics or timing on this. Depending on the exact date of that deprecation, many earlier versions of AnyConnect may no longer operate at any time. Refer to Microsoft's advisory for further information.
Authentication Failure When Using a SHA512 Certificate for Authentication
(For Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 users running an AnyConnect version prior to 4.9.03047) When the client uses a SHA512 certificate for authentication, authentication fails, even though the client logs show that the certificate is being used. The ASA logs correctly show that no certificate was sent by AnyConnect. These versions of Windows require that you enable support for SHA512 certificates in TLS 1.2, which is not supported by default. Refer to https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2973337 for information on enabling support for these SHA512 certificates. 4.9.03049
OpenSSL Cipher Suites Changes
Because the OpenSSL standards development team marked some cipher suites as compromised, we no long support them beyond AnyConnect 3.1.05187. The unsupported cipher suites include the following: DES-CBC-SHA, RC4-SHA, and RC4-MD5.
Likewise, our crypto toolkit has discontinued support for RC4 ciphers; therefore, our support for them will be dropped with releases 3.1.13011 and 4.2.01035 and beyond.
Using Log Trace in ISE Posture
After a fresh installation, you see ISE posture log trace messages as expected. However, if you go into the ISE Posture Profile Editor and change the Enable Agent Log Trace file to 0 (disable), a service restart of AnyConnect is required to get expected results.
Interoperability With ISE Posture on macOS
If you are using macOS 10.9 or later and want to use ISE posture, you may need to do the following to avoid issues:
Turn off certificate validation to avoid a "failed to contact policy server" error during posture assessment.
Disable the captive portal application; otherwise, discovery probes are blocked, and the application remains in pre-posture ACL state.
Firefox Certificate Store on macOS is Not Supported
The Firefox certificate store on macOS is stored with permissions that allow any user to alter the contents of the store, which allows unauthorized users or processes to add an illegitimate CA into the trusted root store. AnyConnect no longer utilizes the Firefox store for either server validation or client certificates.
If necessary, instruct your users how to export your AnyConnect certificates from their Firefox certificate stores, and how to import them into the macOS keychain. The following steps are an example of what you may want to tell your AnyConnect users.
Navigate to Firefox > Preferences > Privacy & Security > Advanced, Certificates tab, click View Certificates.
Select the Certificate used for AnyConnect, and click Export.
Your AnyConnect Certificate(s) will most likely be located under the Authorities category. Verify with your Certificate Administrator, as they may be located under a different category (Your Certificates or Servers).
Select a location to save the Certificate(s), for example, a folder on your desktop.
In the Format pull down menu, select X.509 Certificate (DER). Add the .der extension to the certificate name, if required.

Note
If more than one AnyConnect Certificate and/or a Private Key is used/required, repeat the above process for each Certificate).
Launch KeyChain. Navigate to File, Import Items…, and select the Certificate that you exported from Firefox.
In the Destination Keychain:, select the desired Keychain. The login Keychain that is used for this example may not be the one used at your company. Ask your Certificate Administrator to which Keychain your certificate(s) should be imported.
In the Destination Keychain:, select the desired Keychain. The login Keychain that is used for this example may not be the one used at your company. Ask your Certificate Administrator to which keychain your certificate(s) should be imported.


Repeat the preceding steps for additional Certificates that are used or required for AnyConnect.
SSLv3 Prevents HostScan From Working
(CSCue04930) HostScan does not function when the SSLv3 options SSLv3 only or Negotiate SSL V3 are chosen in ASDM (Configuration > Remote Access VPN > Advanced > SSL Settings > The SSL version for the security appliance to negotiate as a server). A warning message displays in ASDM to alert the administrator.
WebLaunch Issues With Safari
There is an issue with Weblaunch with Safari. The default security settings in the version of Safari that comes with OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) prevents AnyConnect Weblaunch from working. To configure Safari to allow Weblaunch, edit the URL of the ASA to Unsafe Mode, as described below.
Safari 9 (and earlier)
Open Safari Preferences.
Choose Security preference.
Click Manage Website Settings... button.
Choose Java from the options listed on the left side.
Change the option from Block to Allow Always for the website "Hostname_or_IP_address" that you are trying to connect to.
Click Done.
Safari 10 (and later)
Open Safari Preferences.
Choose Security preference.
Check the Internet plug-ins: option to allow plug-ins.
Choose Plug-in Settings button.
Choose Java from the options listed on the left side.
Highlight the "Hostname_or_IP_address" that you are trying to connect to.
Hold Alt (or Option) and click the drop-down menu. Make sure that On is checked, and Run in Safe Mode is unchecked.
Click Done.
Active X Upgrade Can Disable Weblaunch
Automatic upgrades of AnyConnect software via WebLaunch will work with limited user accounts as long as there are no changes required for the ActiveX control.
Occasionally, the control will change due to either a security fix or the addition of new functionality.
Should the control require an upgrade when invoked from a limited user account, the administrator must deploy the control using the AnyConnect pre-installer, SMS, GPO or other administrative deployment methodology.
Java 7 Issues
Java 7 can cause problems with AnyConnect and HostScan. A description of the issues and workarounds is provided in the Troubleshooting Technote Java 7 Issues with AnyConnect, CSD/HostScan, and WebVPN - Troubleshooting Guide, which is in Cisco documentation under Security > CiscoHostScan.
Implicit DHCP filter applied when Tunnel All Networks Configured
To allow local DHCP traffic to flow in the clear when Tunnel All Networks is configured, AnyConnect adds a specific route to the local DHCP server when AnyConnect connects. To prevent data leakage on this route, AnyConnect also applies an implicit filter on the LAN adapter of the host machine, blocking all traffic for that route except DHCP traffic.
AnyConnect over Tethered Devices
Network connectivity provided by Bluetooth or USB tethered mobile phones or mobile data devices are not specifically qualified by Cisco and should be verified with AnyConnect before deployment.
AnyConnect Smart Card Support
AnyConnect supports Smartcard provided credentials in the following environments:
Microsoft CAPI 1.0 and CAPI 2.0 on Windows7, Windows 8, and Windows 10.
Keychain on macOS, and CryptoTokenKit on macOS 10.12 and higher.

Note
AnyConnect does not support Smart cards on Linux or PKCS #11 devices.
AnyConnect Virtual Testing Environment
Cisco performs a portion of AnyConnect testing using these virtual machine environments:
VM Fusion 7.5.x, 10.x, 11.5.x
ESXi Hypervisor 6.0.0, 6.5.0, and 6.7.x
VMware Workstation 15.x
We do not support running AnyConnect in virtual environments; however, we expect AnyConnect to function properly in the VMWare environments we test in.
If you encounter any issues with AnyConnect in your virtual environment, report them. We will make our best effort to resolve them.
UTF-8 Character Support for AnyConnect Passwords
AnyConnect 3.0 or later used with Secure Firewall ASA 8.4(1) or later supports UTF-8 characters in passwords sent using RADIUS/MSCHAP and LDAP protocols.
Disabling Auto Update May Prevent Connectivity Due to a Version Conflict
When Auto Update is disabled for a client running AnyConnect, the Secure Firewall ASA must have the same version of AnyConnect or earlier installed, or the client will fail to connect to the VPN.
To avoid this problem, configure the same version or earlier AnyConnect package on the Secure Firewall ASA, or upgrade the client to the new version by enabling Auto Update.
Interoperability between Network Access Manager and other Connection Managers
When the Network Access Manager operates, it takes exclusive control over the network adapters and blocks attempts by other software connection managers (including the Windows native connection manager) to establish connections. Therefore, if you want AnyConnect users to use other connection managers on their endpoint computers (such as iPassConnect Mobility Manager), they must disable Network Access Manager either through the Disable Client option in the Network Access Manager GUI, or by stopping the Network Access Manager service.
Network Interface Card Drivers Incompatible with Network Access Manager
The Intel wireless network interface card driver, version 12.4.4.5, is incompatible with Network Access Manager. If this driver is installed on the same endpoint as the Network Access Manager, it can cause inconsistent network connectivity and an abrupt shutdown of the Windows operating system.
Configuring Antivirus Applications for AnyConnect
Applications like antivirus, antimalware, and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) can misinterpret the behavior of AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client applications as malicious. You can configure exceptions to avoid such misinterpretation. After installing the AnyConnect modules or packages, configure your antivirus software to allow the AnyConnect Installation folder or make security exceptions for the AnyConnect applications.
The common directories to exclude are listed below, although the list may not be complete:
C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Cisco
C:\ProgramData\Cisco
C:\Program Files x86)\Cisco
Configuring Antivirus Applications for HostScan
Antivirus applications can misinterpret the behavior of some of the applications included in the posture module and the HostScan package as malicious. Before installing the posture module or HostScan package, configure your antivirus software to allow or make security exceptions for these HostScan applications:
cscan.exe
ciscod.exe
cstub.exe
Public Proxy Not Supported by IKEv2
IKEv2 does not support the public-side proxy. If you need support for that feature, use SSL. Private-side proxies are supported by both IKEv2 and SSL as dictated by the configuration sent from the secure gateway. IKEv2 applies the proxy configuration sent from the gateway, and subsequent HTTP traffic is subject to that proxy configuration.
MTU Adjustment on Group Policy May Be Required for IKEv2
AnyConnect sometimes receives and drops packet fragments with some routers, resulting in a failure of some web traffic to pass.
To avoid this, lower the value of the MTU. We recommend 1200. The following example shows how to do this using CLI:
hostname# config t
hostname(config)# group-policy DfltGrpPolicy attributes
hostname(config-group-policy)# webvpn
hostname(config-group-webvpn)# anyconnect mtu 1200
To set the MTU using ASDM, go to Configuration > Network (Client) Access > Group Policies > Add or Edit > Advanced > AnyConnect Client.
MTU Automatically Adjusted When Using DTLS
If Dead Peer Detection (DPD) is enabled for DTLS, the client automatically determines the path MTU. If you previously reduced the MTU using the Secure Firewall ASA, you should restore the setting to the default (1406). During tunnel establishment, the client auto-tunes the MTU using special DPD packets. If you still have a problem, use the MTU configuration on the Secure Firewall ASA to restrict the MTU as before.
Network Access Manager and Group Policy
Windows Active Directory Wireless Group Policies manage the wireless settings and any wireless networks that are deployed to PCs in a specific Active Directory Domain. When installing the Network Access Manager, administrators must be aware that certain wireless Group Policy Objects (GPOs) can affect the behavior of the Network Access Manager. Administrators should test the GPO policy settings with the Network Access Manager before doing full GPO deployment. GPOs pertaining to wireless networks are not supported.
FreeRADIUS Configuration to Work With Network Access Manager
To use Network Access Manager, you may need to adjust the FreeRADIUS configuration. Any ECDH related ciphers are disabled by default to prevent vulnerability. In /etc/raddb/eap.conf, change the cipher_list value.
Full Authentication Required if Roaming between Access Points
A mobile endpoint running Windows 7 or later must do a full EAP authentication instead of leveraging the quicker PMKID reassociation when the client roams between access points on the same network. Consequently, in some cases, AnyConnect prompts the user to enter credentials for every full authentication if the active profile requires it.
User Guideline for Cisco Cloud Web Security Behavior with IPv6 Web Traffic
Unless an exception for an IPv6 address, domain name, address range, or wild card is specified, IPv6 web traffic is sent to the scanning proxy where it performs a DNS lookup to see if there is an IPv4 address for the URL the user is trying to reach. If the scanning proxy finds an IPv4 address, it uses that for the connection. If it does not find an IPv4 address, the connection is dropped.
If you want all IPv6 traffic to bypass the scanning proxies, you can add this static exception for all IPv6 traffic ::/0. Doing this makes all IPv6 traffic bypass all scanning proxies. This means that IPv6 traffic is not protected by Cisco Cloud Web Security.
Preventing Other Devices in a LAN from Displaying Hostnames
After one uses AnyConnect to establish a VPN session with Windows 7 or later on a remote LAN, the network browsers on the other devices in the user’s LAN display the names of hosts on the protected remote network. However, the other devices cannot access these hosts.
To ensure the AnyConnect host prevents the hostname leak between subnets, including the name of the AnyConnect endpoint host, configure that endpoint to never become the primary or backup browser.
Enter regedit in the Search Programs and Files text box.
Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Browser\Parameters\
Double-click MaintainServerList.
The Edit String window opens.
Enter No.
Click OK.
Close the Registry Editor window.
Revocation Message
The AnyConnect certificate revocation warning popup window opens after authentication if AnyConnect attempts to verify a server certificate that specifies the distribution point of an LDAP certificate revocation list (CRL), if the distribution point is only internally accessible.
If you want to avoid the display of this popup window, do one of the following:
Obtain a certificate without any private CRL requirements.
Disable server certificate revocation checking in Internet Explorer.

Caution
Disabling server certificate revocation checking in Internet Explorer can have severe security ramifications for other uses of the OS.
Messages in the Localization File Can Span More than One Line
If you try to search for messages in the localization file, they can span more than one line, as shown in the example below:
msgid ""
"The service provider in your current location is restricting access to the "
"Secure Gateway. "
AnyConnect for macOS Performance when Behind Certain Routers
When AnyConnect for macOS attempts to create an SSL connection to a gateway running IOS, or when AnyConnect attempts to create an IPsec connection to a Secure Firewall ASA from behind certain types of routers (such as the Cisco Virtual Office (CVO) router), some web traffic may pass through the connection while other traffic drops. AnyConnect may calculate the MTU incorrectly.
To work around this problem, manually set the MTU for the AnyConnect adaptor to a lower value using the following command from the macOS command line:
sudo ifconfig utun0 mtu 1200
Preventing Windows Users from Circumventing Always-on
On Windows computers, users with limited or standard privileges may sometimes have write access to their program data folders. These privileges could allow them to delete the AnyConnect profile and thereby circumvent the Always-On feature. To prevent this, configure the computer to restrict access to the C:\ProgramData folder, or at least the Cisco sub-folder.
Avoid Wireless-Hosted-Network
Using the Windows 7 or later, the Wireless Hosted Network feature can make AnyConnect unstable. When using AnyConnect, we do not recommend enabling this feature or running front-end applications that enable it (such as Connectify or Virtual Router).
AnyConnect Requires That the Secure Firewall ASA Not Be Configured to Require SSLv3 Traffic
AnyConnect requires the Secure Firewall ASA to accept TLSv1 or TLSv1.2 traffic, but not SSLv3 traffic. The SSLv3 key derivation algorithm uses MD5 and SHA-1 in a way that can weaken the key derivation. TLSv1, the successor to SSLv3, resolves this and other security issues present in SSLv3.
AnyConnect cannot establish a connection with the following Secure Firewall ASA settings for “ssl server-version”:
ssl server-version sslv3
ssl server-version sslv3-only
Trend Micro Conflicts with Install
If you have Trend Micro on your device, the Network Access Manager will not install because of a driver conflict. You can uninstall the Trend Micro or uncheck trend micro common firewall driver to bypass the issue.
What HostScan Reports
None of the supported antimalware and firewall products report the last scan time information. HostScan reports the following:
For antimalware
Product description
Product version
File system protection status (active scan)
Data file time (last update and timestamp)
For firewall
Product description
Product version
Is firewall enabled
Long Reconnects (CSCtx35606)
You may experience long reconnects on Windows if IPv6 is enabled and auto-discovery of proxy setting is either enabled in Internet Explorer or not supported by the current network environment. As a workaround, you can disconnect any physical network adapters not used for VPN connection or disable proxy auto-discovery in IE, if proxy auto-discovery is not supported by the current network environment.
No Pro-Active Key Caching (PKC) or CCKM Support
Network Access Manager does not support PKC or CCKM caching. Fast transition and fast roaming is unavailable on all Windows platforms.
Application Programming Interface for the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client
AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client includes an Application Programming Interface (API) for those who want to write their own client programs.
The API package contains documentation, source files, and library files to support a C++ interface for the AnyConnect. You can use the libraries and example programs for building on Windows, Linux and MAC platforms. The Makefiles (or project files) for the Windows platform are also included. For other platforms, it includes platform specific scripts showing how to compile the example code. Network administrators can link their application (GUI, CLI, or embedded application) with these files and libraries.
You can download the APIs from Cisco.com.
For support issues regarding the AnyConnect API, send e-mail to the following address: anyconnect-api-support@cisco.com.
