Configure Unified Threat Defense Resource Profiles
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.5.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.5.1
This feature lets you customize the amount of resources that Unified Threat Defense features use on a router. You can use larger resource profiles to process packets simultaneously. Simultaneously processing packets reduces the latency that security features can introduce to the packet processing of the device.
Unified Threat Defense features use the Snort engine to process packets. Snort is an open source network Intrusion Prevention System, capable of performing real-time traffic analysis and packet logging on IP networks. Unified Threat Defense deploys Snort as a single instance on the device to process packets. To improve performance, use the Security App Hosting feature template to allow Unified Threat Defense to use more resources.
You can use the Security App Hosting feature template to modify the resource profile as follows:
Deploy more instances of Snort: When you enable Unified Threat Defense, the device sends each packet from the data plane to the service plane. Unified Threat Defense serially inspects each packet. Once inspected, Unified Threat Defense returns the packet to the data plane. Unified Threat Defense holds each packet to analyze it. These processes introduce latency to the flow of packets that affects the throughput of the device. To combat this latency, you can deploy more instances of Snort. With multiple instances of Snort available, Unified Threat Defense can simultaneously process multiple packets to reduce latency and increase throughput. This feature uses more systems resources.
Download URL databases to the devices: This feature allows the URL Filtering feature of Unified Threat Defense to use a downloaded URL database on the device to find a URL. If the device downloads the database, Unified Threat Defense first uses the database on the device to find the URL. If a URL is not in the downloaded database, Unified Threat Defense connects to the Cloud for the URL information. This Cloud result is saved to a local cache for any subsequent requests to the same URL. This feature requires at least 16 GB bootflash and 16 GB RAM.

Configure Unified Threat Defense Resource Profiles
Configure the Unified Threat Defense Resource Profiles Using Cisco vManage
Configure the Unified Threat Defense Resource Profiles Using Cisco vManage
You can configure the Unified Threat Defense resource profiles using Cisco vManage by doing the following:
From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Configuration > Templates.
Click Feature Templates and then click Add Template.

Note
In Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1 and earlier releases, Feature Templates is called Feature.
Choose the device(s).
Click Security App Hosting.
Enter a template name and description.
Choose whether to enable or disable NAT. NAT is enabled by default.
To use Unified Threat Defense features that connect to the internet, you must enable NAT. For example, URL Filtering and Advanced Malware Protection connect to the internet to perform Cloud lookups. To use these features, enable NAT.
To download the URL database on the device, choose Yes.
To deploy more instances of Snort, choose one of the following resource profiles:
Low: This is the default profile.
Medium.
High.
When you specify a larger resource profile, the device deploys more Snort instances to increase throughput. The larger resource profiles also use more resources on the device. The number of Snort instances deployed by the device differs by platform and software release.
Click Save.
Add this template to the device template.
Attach the device template to the device.
Verify Unified Threat Defense Resource Profiles
To view the Unified Threat Defense resource profiles that you configured, run the following commands:
show app-resource package-profile
show run | section app-hosting appid utd
show app-hosting detail appid utd | section Activated profile name
To view the resource usage between activated resource profiles, run the following commands:
show platform software status control-processor brief 
show platform hardware qfp active datapath utilization
show utd engine standard utilization cpu
show utd engine standard utilization memory
show app-hosting resource
To view the health of one or more Snort instances and the memory usage of UTD, run the following command:
show utd engine standard status
