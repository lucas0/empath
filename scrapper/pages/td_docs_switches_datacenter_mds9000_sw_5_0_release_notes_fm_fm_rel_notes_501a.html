Introduction
Cisco Fabric Manager is the management tool for storage networking across all Cisco SAN and unified fabrics.
Cisco Fabric Manager provides comprehensive visibility for improved management and control of Cisco storage networks (2-, 4-, and 8-Gbps Fibre Channel and Fibre Channel over Ethernet [FCoE]), and it helps reduce overall total cost of ownership (TCO) and complexity through unified discovery of all Cisco Data Center 3.0 devices and through task automation and detailed reporting.
Cisco Fabric Manager provides centralized storage network management services, performance monitoring, federated reporting, troubleshooting tools, discovery, and configuration automation for the data center.
Cisco Fabric Manager includes these management applications:
Fabric Manager (client and server)
Fabric Manager standalone (FMSA)
Device Manager
Performance Manager
Fabric Manager Web Services
For detailed information on using Cisco Fabric Manager to configure a Cisco MDS 9000 Family switch or a Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch, refer to the feature-specific Cisco Fabric Manager Configuration Guides available at the following website:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps10495/tsd_products_support_series_home.html
Version Compatibility
As the features and capabilities of Cisco Fabric Manager continue to evolve, it is important to be aware of the software version compatibility information described in the following sections.
Compatibility with Cisco MDS 9000 Family Switches
Cisco Fabric Manager Release 5.0(1a) can manage MDS 9000 switches that are running any NX-OS 4.2(x) release or any SAN-OS 3.3(x) release.
Any Fabric Manager 3.x release cannot fully manage switches that are running any MDS 9000 NX-OS 4.x release because Fabric Manager Release 3.x cannot manage features that are specific to the MDS 9000 NX-OS 4.x release series. Fabric Manager Release 3.3(x) can manage all legacy features in any SAN-OS 3.x, 2.x, and 1.x release.
In terms of testing and support, future releases of Cisco Fabric Manager 4.x will be backwards compatible with the two previous releases of MDS NX-OS 4.x and with the two highest releases in the SAN-OS 3.x release series.
Compatibility with Cisco Nexus 5000 Series Switches
Cisco Fabric Manager Release 5.0(1a) has limited support for Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches running versions earlier than Release 4.0(1a)N1, because it does not support FCoE features on Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches running versions earlier than Release 4.0(1a)N1.

Fabric Manager Installation Process Overview
The following section presents the flow of the installation process at a high level. Review these steps before you begin the installation process:
1. Verify supported software. Cisco Fabric Manager and Device Manager have been tested with the software listed in Table 4 , html#13838"> Table 6 .
2. Ensure data migration when upgrading Cisco Fabric Manager from Cisco SAN-OS Releases 3.1(2b) and later.
If you are upgrading Cisco Fabric Manager in Cisco SAN-OS Releases 3.1(2b) and later, be aware that data is migrated from the Hypersonic HSQL database to either the PostgreSQL database or Oracle Database 10g Express during the installation. Data is also migrated from Oracle Database 10g Express to Oracle Database 10g Express. If you migrate the database from Oracle to Oracle, the schema is updated. Refer to Table 3 for information on the supported upgrade path.
3. Ensure data migration when upgrading Cisco Fabric Manager from releases prior to Cisco NX-OS Releases 3.1(2).
If you are upgrading Fabric Manager in a Cisco SAN-OS Release prior to 3.1(2b), be aware that data is migrated from the Hypersonic HSQL database to either the PostgreSQL database or the Oracle Database 10g Express during the installation. The Fabric Manager Installer installs the PostgreSQL database on Windows. If you want to install the PostgreSQL database on Solaris or Linux, or if you want to install the Oracle Database 10g Express database, follow the instructions in the “Installing Fabric Manager” section in the Cisco Fabric Manager Fundamentals Configuration Guide.
4. If you are upgrading a previous installation of Fabric Manager, make sure the previous installation is installed and running. Do not uninstall the previous version. If the previous version is uninstalled, the database will not be migrated and your server settings will not be preserved.
5. Select the database.
If you want to use the Oracle Database 10g Express, you must install the database and create a user name and password before continuing with the Fabric Manager installation.
We recommend the Oracle 11g Enterprise Edition for all users who are running Fabric Manager Server in a large environment.
If you want to install the PostgreSQL database, you must disable any security software you are running as PostgreSQL may not install certain folders or users. You must also log in as a Superuser before you start the installation.
6. Install Fabric Manager from the CD-ROM or from files that you download from cisco.com at the following website: http://cisco.com/cgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/mds-fm .
Installing Fabric Manager on Solaris
This section describes how to install Fabric Manager on Solaris.
To install Fabric Manager on Solaris, follow these steps:
Step 1 Set Java 1.5 or 1.6 to the path that is to be used for installing Fabric Manager.
Step 2 Install the database that is to be used with Fabric Manager.
Step 3 Copy the Fabric Manager jar file m9000-fm-5.0.1a.jar from the CD-ROM to a folder on the Solaris workstation.
Step 4 Launch the installer using the following command:
java -Xms512m -Xmx512m -jar m9000-fm-5.0.1a.jar
Step 5 Follow the onscreen instructions provided in the Fabric Manager management software setup wizard.
  NoteIf you have multiple Java Runtime Environments (JREs) installed, you must use the Java and Java Web Start of JRE version 1.6.0_21. To ensure that you use this version, do not accept the default javaws when your browser downloads fabricmanager.jnlp. Instead, choose the browse option and select javaws from the 1.6.0_21 Java installation. If you have multiple Java Runtime Environments (JREs) installed, you must use the Java and Java Web Start of JRE version 1.6.0_21. To ensure that you use this version, do not accept the default javaws when your browser downloads fabricmanager.jnlp. Instead, choose the browse option and select javaws from the 1.6.0_21 Java installation.
Installing Fabric Manager on Windows
This section describes how to install Fabric Manager on Windows.
NoteFabric Manager Server cannot be installed on an Active Directory Server when using PostgreSQL. Fabric Manager servers are domain controllers and cannot create local PostgreSQL user accounts. Fabric Manager Server cannot be installed on an Active Directory Server when using PostgreSQL. Fabric Manager servers are domain controllers and cannot create local PostgreSQL user accounts.
NoteIf you are running Fabric Manager Server on Windows and using the PostgreSQL database, you should examine your Windows Active Directory environment for organizational units (OUs) and make the change recommended below to ensure that Fabric Manager Server does not periodically stop working. If you are running Fabric Manager Server on Windows and using the PostgreSQL database, you should examine your Windows Active Directory environment for organizational units (OUs) and make the change recommended below to ensure that Fabric Manager Server does not periodically stop working.

On a Windows system, the Microsoft Active Directory applies a Group Policy Object (GPO) to the Fabric Manager Server. The GPO does not recognize the local user PostgreSQL because it is not in the GPO allow list. As a result, the GPO removes it, and the PostgreSQL database stops working.

To avoid this situation, you should move the Fabric Manager Server to its own OU and apply the same feature settings as the original OU, but remove the local user account to log in as a service.
If your server is running Terminal Services in Application mode, or if you are running Citrix Metaframe or any other variation, you need to enter the following command at the DOS prompt before installing Fabric Manager Server:
Step 1 Open a command-line prompt by selecting Start > Run , and then type cmd and press Return .
Step 2 At the command prompt, type user /install .
Note Do not close the command line window. This must remain open for the entire duration of the install.
The following is an example of the output of this command:
C:\Documents and Settings\user.domain>USER /INSTALL
User session is ready to install applications.
  Step 3 Follow all steps needed to install Fabric Manager, Fabric Manager Server, and Device Manager. See the instructions later in this section.
Step 4 When the installation is complete, at the command prompt, type user /execute and press Return . Then type exit and press Return .
The following is an example of the output of this command:
C:\Documents and Settings\user.domain>USER /execute
User session is ready to execute applications.
  To install Fabric Manager on Windows, follow these steps:
Step 1 Click the Install Management Software link.
Step 2 Choose Management Software > Cisco Fabric Manager .
Step 3 Click the Installing Fabric Manager link.
Step 4 Select the drive for your CD-ROM.
Step 5 Click the FM Installer link.
Step 6 Follow the onscreen instructions provided in the Fabric Manager Installer 5.0(1a).
  NoteIf you have any folders open or Windows Explorer task windows open during the installation, you might see the following error message: If you have any folders open or Windows Explorer task windows open during the installation, you might see the following error message:

C:\Program Files\Cisco Systems\dcm\fm\help\shared\images\Thumbs.db (Access is denied)

To resolve this issue, close all open folders and open Windows Explorer task windows and restart the FM Installer.
Caution Windows 2000 is incompatible with Fabric Manager Release 5.0(1a). If you install Fabric Manager in a Windows 2000 environment, you are at risk of having an unstable Fabric Manager. We recommend that you exit the installation and update your environment. See Table 4, Table 5, and Table 6 for the list of supported software that has been tested with Cisco Fabric Manager. See Table 3 for the supported upgrade paths for Fabric Manager.
To install Device Manager on your workstation, follow these steps:
Step 1 Enter the IP address of the switch in the Address field of your browser.
Step 2 Click the Cisco Device Manager link in the Device Manager installation window.
Step 3 Click Next to begin the installation.
Step 4 Follow the onscreen instructions to complete the installation of Device Manager.
  NoteIf you use a Java JDK instead of a JRE on Solaris, you might encounter a problem trying to install the Device Manager from a web browser. This can happen because the installer heap limit of 256 MB is not sufficient. If you have this problem, save the jnlp link as file, increase the heap limit to 512 MB, and run If you use a Java JDK instead of a JRE on Solaris, you might encounter a problem trying to install the Device Manager from a web browser. This can happen because the installer heap limit of 256 MB is not sufficient. If you have this problem, save the jnlp link as file, increase the heap limit to 512 MB, and run javaws element-manager.jnlp at the shell prompt.
Configuring a Cisco UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnect for Discovery by Cisco Fabric Manager
Cisco Fabric Manager cannot discover a Cisco UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnect until it has been properly configured. To configure a Cisco UCS 6100 Series before you use Cisco Fabric Manager to discover it, follow these steps:
Step 1 Enable SNMP on the Cisco UCS 6100 Series. SNMP is disabled by default.
Step 2 Identify whether Cisco Fabric Manager discovery is using SNMP version 2 or version 3.
a. If version 2 is in use, define the same community string on the Cisco UCS 6100 Series as is being used on the seed switch for Cisco Fabric Manager discovery.
b. If version 3 is in use, define the same SNMP user or credentials on the Cisco UCS 6100 Series as is being used on the seed switch for Cisco Fabric Manager discovery.
Step 3 Use Cisco Fabric Manager to discover or rediscover the fabric.
  NoteA Cisco UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnect is an NPV device and cannot be used as a seed switch in Cisco Fabric Manager. You should use a Cisco MDS 9000 Family switch or Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch that is connected to UCS Manager as the seed switch. A Cisco UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnect is an NPV device and cannot be used as a seed switch in Cisco Fabric Manager. You should use a Cisco MDS 9000 Family switch or Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch that is connected to UCS Manager as the seed switch.
For additional information, see the Cisco UCS Manager GUI Configuration Guide, 1.0(2).
New Features in Cisco Fabric Manager Release 5.0(1a)
Cisco Fabric Manager Release 5.0(1a) includes the following new features and enhancements:
Cross-Launching in Context of Fabric Manager and DCNM
VSAN Scoping for Fabric Manager Discovery
MDS Configuration Analysis Tool
Fm-Specific Search Engine in Web Client
Web Client Report Template Enhancements
Pre-Configuration Wizard For DMM and Secure Erase
Feature Descriptions
The following sections describe the new features in Cisco Fabric Manager Release 5.0(1a) and state where the feature is documented.
Cross-Launching in Context of Fabric Manager and DCNM
The Cross-network launch feature of Fabric Manager and DCNM marks the beginning of FM and DCNM client integration. Fabric Manager and DCNM clients can be launched from the respective switch icon in Fabric Manager or DCNM topology maps. A shortcut can be double-clicked to launch the corresponding application. For example, in Fabric Manager, the Nexus switch icon will allow users to launch DCNM by double-clicking or by selecting “Show in DCNM” in the context menu.
Where Documented
For documentation on the cross-launching in context feature, see the Cisco Fabric Manager Fundamentals Configuration Guide.
VSAN Scoping for Fabric Manager Discovery
For large enterprises, a SAN fabric can span across multiple geographical regions, consisting of hundreds of VSANs, switches, and thousands of ports. VSAN scoping allows data center administrators to discover switch ports and end-devices attached to VSANs specific to a geographic region. VSAN scoping discovery limits which VSAN within a fabric can be discovered and viewed.
Where Documented
For documentation on the VSAN scoping for Fabric Manager discovery feature, see the Cisco Fabric Manager Fundamentals Configuration Guide.
Switch Configuration Management Tool
Cisco Fabric Manager offers powerful configuration capabilities for installing switches, tuning the fabric after it is operational, and setting up zones, network security, and VSANs.
With the Cisco Fabric Manager intuitive GUI, data center administrators can compare switch configurations side by side, perform configuration policy checks across switches, set alarm thresholds to report to third-party fault-management applications, view individual device and aggregate statistics in real time, and analyze historical performance statistics. In addition, using the MDS Configuration Management Tool, data center administrators can schedule periodic back-ups of running switch configurations and analyze and identify configuration differences over a specified period of time, and filter on the basis of the management object of interest (VSAN, zone, interface, IVR, and so on).
Where Documented
For documentation on the switch configuration management tool, see the Cisco Fabric Manager Fundamentals Configuration Guide.
Fabric Manager Search Engine in Web Client
As the number of switch ports and end-devices increases in the data center, the requirement for immediate visibility—search in particular—becomes more crucial for data center administrators. In Fabric Manager Release 4.2(1), Cisco introduced the ability to federate up to 10 Fabric Manager servers, which dramatically increased the number of switch ports and end devices supported in the data center. The Fabric Manager Web Client has the ability to display any fabric that is part of the federation. Using VSAN scoping, the number of switch ports and end-devices discovered can be limited on a per VSAN basis. Using the Fabric Manager search engine, specific management objects (entities) can be quickly accessed through a query against the entity’s common name, IP address, WWN, or alias.
Where Documented
For documentation on the Fabric Manager search engine feature, see the Cisco Fabric Manager Fundamentals Configuration Guide.
Web Client Report Template Enhancements
To help the data center administrators report on the health, performance, and inventory of their SAN fabric, a user-friendly and scalable template configuration page for custom report generation has been added to Fabric Manager web client. The new page combines template creation, configuration, and deletion into one single page.
Default report templates for SAN health or a daily status and events have been provided. In addition, data center administrators can create customized templates.
Where Documented
For documentation on the web client report template enhancements, see the Cisco Fabric Manager Fundamentals Configuration Guide.
Pre-Configuration Wizard for DMM and Secure Erase
To execute Data Mobility Manager (DMM) and Secure Erase from the Fabric Manager GUI, a number of preconditions must be met prior to executing DMM or Secure Erase commands in the fabric. Such pre-conditions include having an existing SSH connection, the configuration of VSAN IP connectivity, the configuration of static routes to a peer Services Node (MSM-18/4 or MDS 9222i switch), and zoning that includes the pWWN of the Services Node and the Supervisor.
The wizards provided for DMM and Secure Erase step the user through the configuration of these preconditions.

Emulex Driver Version
In some instances, the Emulex driver version 8.1.10.9 may set the task attribute to HEAD_OF_QUEUE instead of SIMPLE_QUEUE. Certain tape drives do not accept this attribute and may reject these commands. The Emulex driver version 8.1.10.12 does not have this issue.
Compatibility of Fabric Manager and Data Mobility Manager
Cisco Fabric Manager in any MDS NX-OS 4.x release does not support Data Mobility Manager (DMM) in any SAN-OS 3.3(x) release or in any 3.2(x) release. To use the Cisco Fabric Manager GUI for DMM, both Fabric Manager and DMM must be running NX-OS or SAN-OS software from the same release series .
Using Fabric Manager for an In-Service Software Upgrade (ISSU)
If you are using Fabric Manager to perform an ISSU to NX-OS Release 5.0(1a) from any release prior to NX-OS Release 4.1(1a), the upgrade might fail. To work around this issue, perform the upgrade from the command-line interface using the install all command. DDTS CSCta94252, which is a duplicate of CSCsu68898, captures the details of this issue.
ISSU downgrades are not impacted.
Limitations for the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series Switches
This section lists the limitations related to Cisco Fabric Manager managing Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches.
Ethernet Configuration
You cannot configure physical Ethernet interfaces using Fabric Manager or Device Manager. You must configure physical Ethernet interfaces using CLI commands.
SPAN
You cannot use Device Manager to configure Ethernet or virtual Ethernet interfaces as SPAN source ports or to configure Ethernet interfaces as destination ports. The workaround is to configure SPAN using CLI commands.
Zoning
In the Edit Local Full Zone Database tool, virtual Fibre Channel interfaces must be specified using the Switch Port WWN method of adding members to a zone. In the Add Members to Zone dialog box, the Switch & Port method and the Domain & Port method are not supported for virtual Fibre Channel interfaces.
Limitations for the Cisco UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnect
This section lists the limitations related to Cisco Fabric Manager managing a Cisco UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnect.
Before Cisco Fabric Manager can discover a Cisco UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnect, you must configure the Cisco UCS 6100 Series. For more information, see the “Configuring a Cisco UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnect for Discovery by Cisco Fabric Manager” section.
Once the Cisco UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnect is configured and Cisco Fabric Manager discovers it, the following limitations apply:
Cisco Fabric Manager supports read-only access for a Cisco UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnect.
Cisco Fabric Manager or Device Manager cannot automatically register itself as a trap or event destination for a Cisco UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnect.
To work around the second of these two limitations, you must manually configure the IP address or port of Cisco Fabric Manager or Device Manager as event destinations on the Cisco UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnect.
Note These limitations are due to the fact that the Cisco UCS 6100 Series allows only read-only operations via SNMP which is the mechanism that Cisco Fabric Manager uses to discover, manage, and configure switches.
Caveats
This section lists the open and resolved caveats for this release.
Resolved Caveats
The following caveats are resolved in Cisco Fabric Manager Release 5.0(1a).
CSCta48412

Workaround : This issue is resolved.
CSCtc54974
Symptom : If you launch Device Manager from Fabric Manager, passwords are written in clear text to the Device Manager message log.
Workaround : This issue is resolved.
CSCtd36659
Symptom : The Fabric Manager DMM job status GUI shows a negative progress completion percentage when migrating a LUN greater than 1 terabyte in size.
Workaround : This issue is resolved.
CSCtd42387
Symptom : In Cisco Fabric Manager, you can clone a zone as follows:
– Click Logical Domains > SAN > and select the fabric name.
– Right click VSAN > Edit Local Full Zone Database .Zones/fcaliases.
– Right click > Create Clone , and enter a new name.
When you follow this procedure in Cisco Fabric Manager Release 4.2(1a), the new zone will have extra entries that the original zone does not have.
Workaround : This issue is resolved.
CSCtd53603
Symptom : When an Enterprise license is not installed, a role created through SNMP fails.
Workaround : This issue is resolved.
CSCtd58862
Symptom : Old connected clients cannot be purged from the Fabric Manager Server Control Panel. A manual purge failed and resulted in the following error:
ClassCast:com.cisco.dcbu.lib.snmp.transport.UdpTransportProvider
This issue is seen in Fabric Manager Server Release 4.2(1a).
Workaround : This issue is resolved.
CSCtd80721
Symptom : On a non-English language version of the Fabric Manager web client, parts of the GUI displayed garbled characters such as question marks (???).
Workaround : This issue is resolved.
CSCtd84186
Symptom : After you click Alias > Enclosure and then click OK multiple times, Fabric Manager hangs.
Workaround : This issue is resolved.
CSCte36444
Symptom : When an MDS switch has the maximum number (32) of SNMP-TCP connections open and a user attempts to open another connection, the following error message may be seen:
switch# show logging log
2009 Dec 18 09:44:49 MDS9513 snmpd: Max SNMP/TCP connections (32) already established. Cannot accept new connection.
2009 Dec 18 09:45:15 MDS9513 last message repeated 53280 times
2009 Dec 18 09:46:16 MDS9513 last message repeated 126132 times
  This situation may occur as follows:
– Discover and open a fabric with the Fabric Manager GUI client.
– Launch another Fabric Manager GUI client and use another user to open the fabric.
– Close the second GUI client.
The TCP session that is open to the switch corresponding to the second client is not cleared. As a result, additional sessions cannot connect to the switch.
Workaround : This issue is resolved.
CSCte51606
Symptom : Cisco Fabric Manager does not recognize a switch with OUI 00-05-73 or 00-05-9b as a Cisco switch. A switch with one of these OUIs cannot be monitored or discovered properly, and Performance Manager cannot collect statistics from it. In addition, a switch with one of these OUIs will not be included in various Fabric Manager wizards including FCIP, the Security Wizard, the Upgrade Wizard, or the IOA wizard.
For additional information about this issue, refer to Field Notice 63302.
Workaround : This issue is resolved when you upgrade to Cisco Fabric Manager Release 3.3(4b), Release 4.2(3a), or Release 5.0(1a).
CSCte56411
Symptom : If you create an FCIP tunnel in Fabric Manager by clicking ISLs -> FCIP -> Tunnel , or in Device Manager by clicking IP-> FCIP-> Tunnel and Tape Acceleration is enabled, you may see the following error message when you try to configure FlowCtrlBufSize:
cfmFcipLinkExtFlowCtrlBufSize.1.0: wrongType error message
  You may also see this error if you try to change the value of FlowCtrlBufSize.
Workaround : This issue is resolved.
Note Cisco Fabric Manager and Device Manager Release 4.2(3a) can configure cfmFcipLinkExtFlowCtrlBufSize on a switch running Cisco MDS NX-OS Release 4.2(1). If you need to configure cfmFcipLinkExtFlowCtrlBufSize on a switch running Cisco NX-OS Release 4.1(3a) or earlier, use the compatible Fabric Manager or Device Manager release. For example, use Fabric Manager or Device Manager Release 4.1(3) with a switch running Cisco MDS NX-OS Release 4.1(3); use Fabric Manager or Device Manager Release 3.x with a switch running Cisco SAN-OS Release 3.x.
CSCte93589
Symptom : Fabric Manager Server creates hung SSH sessions on the switch if users who are logged in are remote and not defined locally on the switch. This symptom may be seen when the users are defined in TACAS or AAA.
Workaround : This issue is resolved.
Open Caveats
The following caveats are open in Cisco Fabric Manager Releaes 5.0(1a):
CSCsk35725
Symptom : Fabric Manager takes 2 to 3 minutes to bring up the DMM job creation wizard in a setup with 25 switches, 400 enclosures, and 2400 entries in the name server.
Workaround : None.
CSCsu72195
Symptom : When replaying DMM job configurations saved as an ASCII text file (after performing a write erase), the DMM job includes discrepancies. These discrepancies occur due to the interface and zone configurations that are in an area below the DMM job configuration in the ASCII text file. The configurations stored in the ASCII text file are replayed sequentially from top to bottom.
Workaround : None.
CSCtd01789
Symptom : When you use the Fabric Manager Software Install Wizard to install the Nexus 5000 software, and you use the Remote option to copy the images in Step 2 of the wizard, you may see the following error message when you click Verify Remote Server and Path :
Size of the file /builds/n5000-uk9.4.1.3.N2.1.115.bin is 136228816 bytes, which is greater than 120 MB
  The error occurs because the default flash space is 120 MB, but the size of the Nexus 5000 system image is 129 MB.
Conditions : This issue is seen when all of the following conditions are met:
Nexus 5000 software Releases 4.0(1a) or 4.1(3) is selected to be installed via the Fabric Manager Software Install Wizard.
The Remote radio button for the Transfer Files From: option is selected in Step 2 of the Fabric Manager Software Install Wizard.
The Verify Remote Server and Path button is clicked.
Workaround : Manually change the value in the Flash Space: text field to 130 MB and then click Verify Remote Server and Path to resolve the issue.
CSCtd15304
Symptom : When you use Cisco Fabric Manager to install Cisco NX-OS Release 4.1.3(N2)(1) on a Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch, a Success Reset message is displayed just before the switch reboots.
Workaround : To find the status of the software installation, perform the following steps:
1. Close the install wizard and go to the main Fabric Manager screen.
2. Click Rediscover… in the toolbar and wait for the rediscovery to complete. Once the rediscovery is complete, you may encounter either of the following scenarios:
– If the topology shows the switch with a cross, the switch is rebooting or down. You can wait for some time and repeat step 2 again.
– If the topology shows the switch as discovered or managed, you can select the corresponding fabric tree node from the Logical Domains tree. In the right- hand side panel, under the Switches tab, there is information about the switches, along with their current versions. You can use this to confirm the status of the software installation.
  CSCte79094
Symptom : The standalone Fabric Manager or Device Manager online help does not display in the Firefox 3 browser on Linux or Solaris platforms. The online help does work for Fabric Manager running in client only mode.
Workaround : None.
CSCtf51524
Symptom : When you attempt to launch Fabric Manager Server from Solaris, the generated path to the .jar file is incorrect, so Fabric Manager Server fails to launch.
Workaround : None.
