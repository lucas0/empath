Cisco IOx provides uniform and consistent hosting capabilities for various types of apps across Cisco platforms.

With Cisco IOx, developers can create a wide variety of IoT apps, such as data aggregation system and control systems.
New Features in this Release
Access container and VM app console via Local Manager UI
Support for Cisco signed apps and validation on IR8x9 platforms
Support for extending app network interface MTU to that of host interface
Provision env variables in a file for native docker containers

  Limitations and Restrictions
Check the platform documentation for the supported upgrade path. In some rare cases, the platform needs to be upgraded to a specific intermediate release.
If CAF crashes abruptly, CAF comes back up with limited functionality. If app management services are reported as down, you can download the tech support logs and verify the reason from the CAF logs or in syslog files.
App asking for multiple USB ports and devices is not supported. This restriction applies only to FD.
USB device hot swap-out and swap-in are not supported. You must plug in the USB device before activating the application on the IOx device.
