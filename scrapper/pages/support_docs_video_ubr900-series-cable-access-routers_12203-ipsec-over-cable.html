Introduction
Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a framework of open standards that ensures secure private communications over IP networks. Based on standards developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), IPsec ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data communications across a public IP network. IPsec provides a necessary component for a standards-based, flexible solution to deploy a network-wide security policy.
This document provides a configuration example of IPsec between two Cisco cable modems. This configuration creates an encryption tunnel across a cable network between two Cisco uBR9xx Series cable modem routers. All traffic between the two networks is encrypted. But traffic destined for other networks is allowed to pass unencrypted. For small office, home office (SOHO) users, this allows the creation of virtual private networks (VPNs) across a cable network.
Prerequisites
Requirements
There are no specific requirements for this document.
Components Used
The modems must conform to these requirements to configure IPsec on two cable modems:
Cisco uBR904, uBR905, or uBR924 in Routing Mode
IPsec 56 Feature Set
Cisco IOSÂ® Software Release 12.0(5)T or later
In addition, you must have a Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS), which is any Data-over-Cable Service Interface Specifications (DOCSIS)-compliant headend cable router, such as the Cisco uBR7246, Cisco uBR7223, or Cisco uBR7246VXR.
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Conventions
Refer to Cisco Technical Tips Conventions for more information on document conventions.
Background Theory
The example in this document uses a uBR904 cable modem, a uBR924 cable modem, and a uBR7246VXR CMTS. The cable modems run Cisco IOS Software Release 12.1(6), and the CMTS runs Cisco IOS Software Release 12.1(4)EC.
Note: This example is done with manual configuration on the cable modems through the console port. If an automated process is performed through the DOCSIS configuration file (the ios.cfg script is created with the IPsec configuration) then access lists 100 and 101 cannot be used. This is because the Cisco implementation of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) docsDevNmAccess table uses Cisco IOS access lists. It creates one access list per interface. On uBR904, 924, and 905, the first two access lists are generally used (100 and 101). On a cable modem that supports Universal Serial Bus (USB), like the CVA120, three access lists are used (100, 101, and 102).

crypto isakmp policy 10

!--- Creates an Internet Key Exchange (IKE) policy with the specified priority !--- number of 10. The range for the priority is 1 to 10000, where 1 is the !--- highest priority. This command also enters Internet Security Association !--- and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) policy configuration command mode.

 hash md5

!--- Specifies the MD5 (HMAC variant) hash algorithm for packet authentication.

 authentication pre-share

!--- Specifies that the authentication keys are pre-shared, as opposed to !--- dynamically negotiated using Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman (RSA) public !--- key signatures. 
 group 2

!--- Diffie-Hellman group for key negotiation.

 lifetime 3600

!--- Defines how long, in seconds, each security association should exist before !--- it expires. Its range is 60 to 86400, and in this case, it is 1 hour.
 
crypto isakmp key mykey address 18.18.18.18

!--- Specifies the pre-shared key that should be used with the peer at the !--- specific IP address. The key can be any arbitrary alphanumeric key up to !--- 128 characters. The key is case-sensitive and must be entered identically !--- on both routers. In this case, the key is mykey and the peer is the !--- Ethernet address of uBR904-2
.
!
crypto IPSec transform-set TUNNELSET ah-md5-hmac esp-des

!--- Establishes the transform set to use for IPsec encryption. As many as !--- three transformations can be specified for a set. Authentication Header !--- and ESP are in use. Another common transform set used in industry is !--- esp-des esp-md5-hmac.

!
crypto map MYMAP local-address Ethernet0

!--- Creates the MYMAP crypto map and applies it to the Ethernet0 interface.

crypto map MYMAP 10 ipsec-isakmp

!--- Creates a crypto map numbered 10 and enters crypto map configuration mode.

 set peer 18.18.18.18

!--- Identifies the IP address for the destination peer router. In this case, !--- the Ethernet interface of the remote cable modem (ubr904-2) is used.

 set transform-set TUNNELSET

!--- Sets the crypto map to use the transform set previously created.

 match address 101

!--- Sets the crypto map to use the access list that specifies the type of !--- traffic to be encrypted. !--- Do not use access lists 100, 101, and 102 if the IPsec config is !--- downloaded through the ios.cfg in the DOCSIS configuration file.

Verify
Use this section to confirm that your configuration works properly.
In order to verify that IPsec works:
Verify these things:
The Cisco IOS software supports IPsec.
The running configuration is correct.
Interfaces are up.
Routing works.
The access list defined to encrypt traffic is correct.
Create traffic and look at the Encrypt and Decrypt, to see the amount that is increasing.
Turn on debugs for crypto.
The Output Interpreter Tool (registered customers only) (OIT) supports certain show commands. Use the OIT to view an analysis of show command output.
Issue the show version command on both cable modems.

From the last command, you can see that the Ethernet interfaces are up. The IP addresses of the Ethernet interfaces were manually entered. The cable interfaces are also up and they learned their IP addresses through DHCP. Because these cable addresses are dynamically assigned, they cannot be used as peers in the IPSec configuration.

From the routing table of uBR904-2, you can see that the network for the Ethernet of uBR924-1 is in the routing table.
Note: There might be cases where you cannot run a routing protocol between the two cable modems. In such cases, you must add static routes on the CMTS to direct traffic for the Ethernet interfaces of the cable modems.
The next thing to check is the certification of the access list; issue the show access-lists command on both routers.
ubr924-1#show access-lists
Extended IP access list 101
    permit ip 19.19.19.0 0.0.0.255 18.18.18.0 0.0.0.255 (2045 matches)

ubr904-2#show access-lists
Extended IP access list 101
    permit ip 18.18.18.0 0.0.0.255 19.19.19.0 0.0.0.255 (2059 matches)
The access list set the IPsec session when the LAN behind uBR924-1 (19.19.19.0) sends IP traffic to the LAN behind uBR904-2 (18.18.18.0), and vice versa. Do not use "any" on the access lists, because it creates problems. Refer to Configuring IPsec Network Security for more details.
There is no IPsec traffic. Issue the show crypto engine connection active command.
ubr924-1#show crypto engine connection active
ID Interface    IP-Address    State    Algorithm           Encrypt  Decrypt
1                              set     HMAC_MD5+DES_56_CB        0        0

There are no IPsec connections because no traffic has matched the access lists.
Note: Refer to Important Information on Debug Commands before you use debug commands.
The next step is to turn on some crypto debugs to generate interesting traffic.
In this example, these debugs are turned on:
debug crypto engine
debug crypto IPsec
debug crypto key-exchange
debug crypto isakmp
You must first generate some interesting traffic to see the output of the debugs. Issue an extended ping from the Ethernet port of uBR904-2 to the PC on uBR924-1 (IP address 19.19.19.1).

The first 200x line shows the 99 packets received. It has to decrypt the packets in order to send them to PC1. The second line shows 99 sent packets. It has to encrypt the packets before it sends them to uBR904-2. The third and fourth lines do the same process, but with ESP-DES transform instead of AH-MD5-HMAC.
Note: If the transform set that is configured on the cable modem is ESP-DES ESP-MD5-HMAC, you only see two autonomous systems (ASs), as opposed to the four shown in the previous show command.

You can issue the clear crypto isakmp and clear crypto sa commands to clear the connections. Also, if there is no traffic across the IPsec tunnel during the expiration time, IPsec resets the connection automatically.
