Upgrade Considerations
The following Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices support multirate interfaces and support the 1GE SFP (optical and CU) and 10GE SFP+ (optical and CU) modules on their 10G interfaces ports:
Cisco ASR 1001-HX Router
Cisco Catalyst 8500-12X4QC
Cisco Catalyst 8500-12X
These devices support auto-negotiation on 10G interfaces ports with 1GE SFP (optical and CU) modules. The following notes apply to auto-negotiation in both SD-WAN and non-SD-WAN modes:
For releases before Cisco IOS XE 17.6.1a, auto-negotiation can be configured using the CLI.
For releases before Cisco IOS XE 17.6.1a, if you use the CLI or Cisco vManage to reboot a device with a 10G interface that includes a 10GE SFP+ module, that interface will not come up. In this situation, use Cisco vManage or the CLI to configure no negotiation auto for the interface, then reboot the device.
From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.3a, auto neg values for auto-negotiation are pushed to 10G interfaces on supported devices through feature templates. Ensure that you know which SFP module is on which 10G interface on a device so that you can properly configure the feature template.
From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.3a, the negotiation auto command is not supported on a 10G interface that includes a 10GE SFP+ module.
From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.3a, the no negotiation auto command with the default OFF option must be sent through a feature template to all 10G interfaces that include a 10GE SFP+ module. Otherwise, the template push fails.
Before upgrading to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.3a, use a feature template, a CLI add-on feature templates, or the CLI to apply no negotiation auto to all 10G interfaces that include a 10GE SFP+ module.
If you upgrade to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.3a from a release in which auto-negotiation was enabled on a 10G interface that includes a 10GE SFP+ module, that interface will not come up. In this situation, use the CLI to configure no negotiation auto for the interface after the upgrade completes.
Restrictions
Restrictions for single "universalk9" image
Dual-IOSd is supported only in autonomous mode.
Images without payload encryption and NO-LI (universalk9_npe, universalk9_noli, universalk9_npe_noli) images are not supported in controller mode. Only universalk9 images are supported.
After onboarding and determining the mode of operation, changing from Controller mode to Autonomous mode or vice-versa, results in the loss of configuration.
Reset button functionality is not supported in controller mode on Cisco ISR 1000 series Integrated Service Routers. The reset button does not function to restore a golden image or configuration in controller mode.
Auto-install (Python and TCL scripts) and ZTP—Autoinstall and ZTP are not supported in controller mode. If DHCP discovers an attempt to install using either of these processes, a mode change to Autonomous mode is triggered.
WebUI—In controller mode, WebUI is not supported and an error message is displayed, if used.
Self-Signed Trustpoint
A self-signed trustpoint is generated and loaded to a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device when the device boots up. If this trustpoint is deleted for any reason, you can generate and load a new trustpoint by rebooting the device. The new key may be different than the deleted one.
Introducing Autonomous and Controller Mode
The Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r release introduces two installation modes – Autonomous and Controller modes. The autonomous mode supports the functionality of Cisco IOS XE non SD-WAN deployment and the controller mode supports the Cisco SD-WAN solution.
The following are the main differences between Autonomous mode and Controller mode:

Description
Support for the Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge Software Platform on OpenStack Train
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.1a
This feature introduces support for managing a Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge software platform hosted in the OpenStack cloud computing platform "Train" release.
Beginning with Cisco IOS XE Release 17.4.1a, Cisco SD-WAN supports the Cisco Catalyst 8000V virtual router platform, which replaces the Cisco CSR1000V and Cisco ISRv. Installing the Cisco Catalyst 8000V in an Cisco SD-WAN environment requires Cisco vManage Release 20.4.1 or later.
Download the Cisco Catalyst 8000V software image that is appropriate for your method of deployment. For example, this can be an OVA file for ESXi, or a QCOW2 image for OpenStack or KVM. Do not choose an ISO image. Have the image ready to upload to the Cisco vManage software image repository. The file name begins with: c8000v-universalk9

Note
To operate with Cisco SD-WAN, the device must be in controller mode. When starting the device in controller mode, boot the device using the bootflash:packages.conf file.
For complete information about the platform, including installation in KVM, ESXi, and OpenStack environments, see the Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge Software Installation and Configuration Guide. For information about creating a bootstrap file for onboarding the Cisco Catalyst 8000V into Cisco SD-WAN, see Bootstrap Process for Cisco SD-WAN Cloud-Hosted Devices.
Clean Install
We recommend a clean install of the Cisco Catalyst 8000V. This ensures support for all features, provides the most up-to-date licensing, and ensures that devices and the controller stay synchronized. For cases where upgrade is necessary, see the procedure in Upgrade to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r or Later.

Note
After a clean install of the Cisco Catalyst 8000V, it is not possible to downgrade the device to a release earlier than Cisco IOS XE Release 17.4.1a.
Upgrading a Cisco CSR1000V to a Cisco Catalyst 8000V
Upgrading a Cisco CSR1000V or Cisco ISRv virtual router to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.4.1a includes upgrading to the Cisco Catalyst 8000V. Note the following:
The Cisco Catalyst 8000V preserves all of the functionality available on Cisco CSR1000V or Cisco ISRv platforms.
Performing the upgrade in Cisco vManage preserves the configuration of the device(s) being upgraded.
OpenStack
Installing a Cisco Catalyst 8000V on the OpenStack Train release requires using a Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.1a or later image for the Cisco Catalyst 8000V.
Cisco does not support installing a Cisco Catalyst 8000V on OpenStack using an earlier image, or installing on OpenStack using an earlier image and upgrading to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.1a.
Plug and Play in Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r and Later Releases
Plug and Play Onboarding Workflow
Mode Discovery with Plug and Play Onboarding
Automatic IP Address Detection
Plug and Play Onboarding Workflow
Place an order for the device in Cisco Commerce with Smart Account and Virtual Account details of the customer.
The device information from Cisco Commerce like Device serial number, Smart Account, and Virtual Account are added to the Plug and Play portal.
Add a vBond controller profile into the Plug and Play (PnP) portal for the same Smart Account and Virtual Accounts.
Associate the new device to the vBond controller profile manually.
PnP sends all relevant information including vBond details, device serial number, organization name, and network ID to Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP).
Download the device serial number file (provisioning file) from PnP and upload it to Cisco vManage. The devices are now available on Cisco vManage. You can also use the Sync Smart Account option on vManage to sync the device with your virtual account and populate the device in Cisco vManage.

Note
If you created and scheduled a device template on Cisco vManage Release 20.3.x and upgraded Cisco vManage to Cisco vManage Release 20.4.1 or later before onboarding the target device, when you onboard the device using PNP or ZTP, the template push fails. To avoid this failure, reschedule the template after upgrading the Cisco vManage software and then onboard the device.

Note
If the ZTP process for a device is interrupted because the device reloads or power cycles, the ZTP process does not restart and the device comes online with the Cisco vManage image that was in its original configuration. In this situation, upgrade the device to the desired Cisco vManage release manually.

Note
For more information, refer to the Plug and Play Support Guide.
Mode Discovery with Plug and Play Onboarding
The PnP-based discovery process determines the mode in which the device operates, based on the controller discovery and initiates a mode change, if required. The mode change results in a reboot of the device. Once reboot is complete, the device performs appropriate discovery process.
When you upgrade to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r or later, on a Cisco device that already runs a Cisco IOS XE or Cisco SD-WAN image, the device starts in autonomous mode or controller mode depending on the configured controller.
Plug and Play (PnP) deployment include the following discovery process scenarios:

Release Information
Description
Day 0 WAN Interface Automatic IP Detection using ARP
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.1a
Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.7.1
Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1
This feature enables a device to automatically learn about the available IP addresses and default gateway information when a DHCP server is not available. The device assigns an IP address to its WAN interface, and then contacts the PnP server and begins the PnP onboarding process.
Typically, the WAN interface on a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device or Cisco vEdge device is configured as a DHCP client, and this interface receives an IP address and gateway server information from the DHCP server during the plug-and-play (PnP) onboarding process.
If the DHCP server is not available, the device automatically learns about the available IP addresses and default gateway information by using Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) packets. If an IP address that the device learns allows a successful connection to the PnP server, the device continues with the PnP onboarding process.

Note
This feature applies only to day zero deployments and is enabled by default.
Prerequisites for Automatic IP Address Detection
To trigger ARP, configure the IP address of the device as the BGP neighbor on the provider edge (PE) router.
This PE router is the first point of contact for the device in the WAN transport network. The PE router then sends ARP packets with this IP address to the device. The device receives the ARP packets, and then the Automatic IP Address Detection feature defines the ARP destination IP address as the device's WAN interface IP address.
For Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices, the network mask of this IP address must be 30 bits.
For automatic IP address detection and redirection through an on-premises ZTP server, the A record of the ZTP server on the DNS server must be set to ztp.cisco.com. In addition, the DNS server must have an ip name-server value of 8.8.8.8 or 8.8.4.4.
For automatic IP address detection, a device uses 8.8.8.8 or 8.8.4.4 as the DNS server to resolve devicehelper.cisco.com or ztp.cisco.com. The PnP process then attempts to reach devicehelper.cisco.com or ztp.cisco.com to continue onboarding.

Note
An IP address that a device automatically detects is not preserved during reboots of the device that occur before the PnP onboarding completes. In such cases, an IP address is assigned automatically when the PE router ARP cache expires.
Limitations and Restrictions for Automatic IP Address Detection
The following limitations and restrictions apply only to Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices:
This feature is supported only on Cisco 1000 Series Integrated Service Routers, Cisco 4000 Series Integrated Service Router, and Cisco Catalyst 8200 and 8300 Series Edge Platforms. On these devices, this features is supported only for Gigabit Ethernet Interface 0/0/0.
The feature is supported only on devices that are in controller (SD-WAN configuration) mode. See https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/sdwan-xe-gs-book/install-upgrade-17-2-later.html.
This feature is supported only in a simple 30 bit network mask Layer 2 network in which one PE router and one customer edge router are in the same VLAN.
This feature does not support VRRP, HSRP, or GLBP on the PE router.
An ARP destination IP address is used as the WAN interface IP address on a device only after the device receives the same ARP request eight times within an interval of 150 seconds.

Switch Modes Using Cisco CLI
Creating a Cisco SD-WAN Bootstrap Configuration File
See On-Site Bootstrap Process for Cisco SD-WAN Devices and Generate a Bootstrap File For Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices Using the CLI for information about generating a bootstrap file.
New Installation: Mode Change Device Day Zero Scenario
If the device is running a pre-17.2 universalk9 image on a new box, or for an existing box where you performed write erase and reload and loaded a Cisco IOS XE 17.2 or newer image, the device boots in day zero configuration and in autonomous mode.
The new device determines if a mode change is required based on the bootstrap file.
If ciscosdwan.cfg or ciscosdwan_cloud_init.cfg bootstrap file in a plugged in the bootstrap location, mode change to controller mode is initiated. After the device boots up in controller mode, the configuration present in the configuration file is applied.
If a ciscortr.cfg bootstrap file or config-wizard is discovered, mode change is not initiated and the boot up continues in the Autonomous mode.

Note
The bootstrap file (ciscosdwan.cfg) is generated by Cisco vManage, and has UUID, but no OTP.
For software devices (Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge Software, Cisco Cloud Services Router 1000V Series, and Cisco ISRv), and for OTP-authenticated devices such as the Cisco ASR1002-X, use the bootstrap file ciscosdwan_cloud_init.cfg. This file has OTP but no UUID validation.
Switch Modes Using Cisco CLI
Use the controller-mode command in privileged EXEC mode to switch between controller and autonomous modes.
Autonomous Mode
The controller-mode disable command switches the device to autonomous mode.
Device# controller-mode disable
Controller Mode

Note
To switch the device to the controller-mode, boot the system using either the bootflash:/*.bin or bootflash:/packages.conf file.

Note
If bootflash:core or harddisk:core contain core files (files containing information about process crashes), move the files to another location before changing the device to controller mode. If these files remain in the bootflash:core or harddisk:core directories, Cisco vManage displays an alarm after onboarding the device. You can move the files to any other directory on the device other than a core directory.
The controller-mode enable command switches the device to controller mode.
Device# controller-mode enable
Notes
Note
Description
Bundle mode
If device is booted with bundle mode (Super packages), after reboot, the image gets automatically expanded and activated to prepare the router for SDWAN operation. Devices with 4GB RAM may require an additional reboot to free up space in /bootflash. The following devices with 4GB RAM need reload:
Cisco ISR 4451
Cisco ISR 4431
Cisco ISR 4461
Cisco ISR 4351
Cisco ISR 4331
Cisco ISR 4321
Viewing the contents of the bootflash:/.sdwaninstaller directory
You cannot view the contents of the bootflash:/.sdwaninstaller directory of a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device in either of the following conditions:
The device is in controller mode.
or
The device is in autonomous mode and using Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a or later.
Mode Discovery and Mode Change with Bootstrap Files
On a device that already runs a Cisco IOS XE non SD-WAN image, after upgrading to a Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r or later image, the device boots up in autonomous mode.

Note
If there is a previous SD-WAN configuration file present on the device, the device boots in controller mode. Before performing an upgrade, ensure that you remove any stale SD-WAN configuration files from bootflash.
Detailed steps to delete all SD-WAN artifacts from bootflash:
delete /force bootflash:/ciscosdwan*.cfg
delete /force /recursive bootflash:/.sdwaninstallerfs
delete /force /recursive bootflash:/.sdwaninstaller
delete /force /recursive bootflash:/.sdwaninternal
delete /force /recursive bootflash:/sdwan
delete /force /recursive bootflash:/vmanage-admin
delete /force /recursive bootflash:/.cdb_backup
delete /force /recursive bootflash:/.installer/active
delete /force /recursive bootflash:/.installer
On a device that already runs a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN image, after upgrading to a Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r or later image, the device boots up in controller mode.

Note
Installing the Cisco Catalyst 8000V on OpenStack requires using the Cisco Catalyst 8000V image for Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.1a or later.
Use the controller-mode enable command to switch from autonomous to controller mode and the controller-mode disable command to switch from controller mode to autonomous mode.
To switch modes using CLI, ensure that the appropriate configuration files mentioned in the table below are present. After the device boots up, the configuration present in the configuration file is applied. The device reads the configuration file and uses the configuration information to come up on the network.

Note
On a Cisco CSR1000v device (for Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2 or later) and a Cisco Catalyst 8000V (for Cisco IOS XE Release 17.4 or later) image deployment, if you want to boot up the device in controller mode, load the bootstrap file generated by Cisco vManage by bootstrap (ESXi, KVM, and OpenStack) or user-data (AWS) or custom-data (Azure and GCP).
The following fields must be present in the ciscosdwan_cloud_init.cfg bootstrap file:
otp
uuid
vbond
org

Note
When the device mode is switched from autonomous to controller, the startup configuration and the information in NVRAM (certificates), are erased. This action is equivalent to running the write erase command.

Note
When the device mode is switched from controller to autonomous, all Yang-based configuration is preserved and can be reused if you switch back to controller mode.

Note
When the device is in Day N configuration and is reloaded, the presence of a bootstrap file does not impact the device operating mode.

Note
You cannot view the contents of the bootflash:/.sdwaninstaller directory and .sdwanistallerfs file of a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device in either of the following conditions:
The device is in controller mode.
or
The device is in autonomous mode and using Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a or later.
Directory, more, copy and delete operations are not allowed when the file and directory are hidden in controller-mode.
Reset Controller Mode Configuration
If you use request platform software sdwan config reset or request platform software sdwan software reset commands to bring the device back to controller-mode day-zero configuration, the device performs one of the following actions:
Performs mode discovery. For more information on mode discovery, see Mode Discovery with Plug and Play Onboarding.
Uses the appropriate configuration file to perform bootstrap. For more information on SD-WAN bootstrap configuration file, see Creating a Cisco SD-WAN Bootstrap Configuration File.
To erase the SD-WAN configuration of the current active image, use the following CLI:
Device# request platform software sdwan config reset
%WARNING: Bootstrap file doesn't exist and absence of it can cause loss of connectivity to the controller.
For saving bootstrap config, use:
request platform software sdwan bootstrap-config save
Proceed to reset anyway? [confirm]
Backup of running config is saved under /bootflash/sdwan/backup.cfg
WARNING: Reload is required for config-reset to become effective.

Note
The warning listed in the above configuration is visible only on Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.1a and later images.
For the changes to take effect, you must reload the router after running the CLI. Running this CLI ensures the configuration for the currently installed version is wiped along with crypto keys and the device enters the day zero workflow after the reload.
If the device is not set up to use PnP for onboarding, then it reads the configuration file in the bootflash and uses the configuration information to come up on the network. If the device is setup to use PnP onboarding, then after reload, the PnP discovery will start again.

Note
In the case of public clouds, just like a fresh install, additional bootstrap configuration is provisioned that allows you to login to the instance.

Note
In public cloud and NFVIS environments, ensure that a latest day-zero bootstrap configuration file (exported from Cisco vManage) is available in a supported location and following standard file naming conventions (example: bootflash:/ciscosdwan_cloud_init.cfg file), before the configuration reset operation is performed.

Warning
Failure to follow save the bootstrap file in these environments cause loss of virtual machine connectivity.

Change the Console Port Access After Installation, in Controller Mode
Before You Begin
Before beginning this procedure, ensure that you have access to the Cisco CSR1000V or Cisco Catalyst 8000V router through the currently configured console access method.
Change the Console Port Access
This procedure changes the method for connecting to the console to access a Cisco CSR1000V or Cisco Catalyst 8000V software device.
The image used for deploying the Cisco CSR1000V or Cisco Catalyst 8000V software determines the default type of console access to use, which can be virtual or serial.
The procedure includes changing the mode from controller to autonomous, and then back to controller, which is required for operation with Cisco SD-WAN. These mode changes cause the device to reload.
Perform the following steps to change the console port access.
In EXEC mode, enter enable to enter privileged EXEC mode.

Use the following procedures to upgrade your device to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r or later images.

Note
Do not delete the existing image to ensure that you have a rollback option.

Note
If an upgrade fails, do not attempt to reactivate the new software image. Instead, remove the new software image, identify and correct any configuration settings that might have caused the failure, and try the upgrade procedure again. If the issue persists, contact Cisco for assistance.

Note
When upgrading to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.4.1a from Cisco IOS XE Releases 17.3.1a or earlier, we recommend that you do not make any changes to the device configuration using CLI, while a feature template is detached. Starting Cisco IOS XE Release 17.4.1a, we use Cisco vManage assisted upgrades. In this upgrade procedure, Cisco vManage saves the device configuration before the upgrade. If the configuration on the device, that is modified using CLI is not same as on Cisco vManage, then the device has inconsistent configuration after the upgrade.
For example, if you configure the BGP AS number of a device to a different value using CLI, the device can have inconsistent configuration and the upgrade fails. If the upgrade is performed when the device is in CLI mode, then you must revert the BGP AS number to the original value and then upgrade the device. Therefore, we recommend that you upgrade the device using Cisco vManage.

Note
Beginning with Cisco IOS XE Release 17.5.1a, if you are upgrading the firmware for a device on which the primary tunnel interface is a cellular interface and the backup tunnel interface is a gigabit interface, use the gigabit interface as the primary interface for the firmware upgrade.
For information about configuring the priority of a tunnel interface, see the vmanage-connection-preference command in Cisco SD-WAN Command Reference. An interface that is configured with a higher preference value has a higher priority.
Upgrade Using Cisco vManage
Upgrade Using CLI
Upgrade Using Cisco vManage
We recommend using Cisco vManage to upgrade. This keeps devices and the controller synchronized.
Use the Cisco vManage upgrade and activate procedure described in the Cisco SD-WAN Monitor and Maintain guide.
Upgrade Using CLI
We recommend using Cisco vManage to upgrade. This keeps devices and the controller synchronized. If it is necessary to upgrade using the CLI, use the following steps.
Back Up Configuration Files
Use these following steps to make configuration file copies before performing the manual upgrade process. Without these steps, the router will lose its configuration during the upgrade.

Note
If the deployment is on a public cloud service, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), failure to save the configuration before upgrading manually can cause an unrecoverable loss of connectivity with the device. In contrast to a hardware device, there may be no way to gain any type of console access to the virtual router.
Use the following command to make a backup copy of the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN configuration:
show running-config | redirect bootflash:/sdwan/ios.cli
Use the following command to make a backup copy of the Cisco SD-WAN running configuration:
show sdwan running-config | redirect bootflash:/sdwan/sdwan.cli
Upgrade Procedure

Onboard Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge Software Hosted by a Cloud Service, Using PAYG Licensing
To onboard a Cisco Catalyst 8000V platform hosted by a cloud service, using pay as you go (PAYG) licensing, perform these steps.
You can also use Cisco Cloud onRamp for Multi-Cloud to onboard a Cisco Catalyst 8000V platform using PAYG licensing. For information to integrate public cloud infrastructure into the Cisco SD-WAN fabric, see Cloud OnRamp Configuration Guide, Cisco IOS XE Release 17.x.

Note
This procedure is applicable to Cisco Catalyst 8000V hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Devices, and click Add PAYG WAN Edges.
In the Add PAYG WAN Edges dialog box, enter the number of PAYG devices to onboard into Cisco SD-WAN, select the Validate check box, and click Add.
The Task View page opens, showing the progress as Cisco vManage creates logical devices.

Note
Validating causes Cisco vManage to publish the list of devices to the Cisco vBond Orchestrator and Cisco vSmart Controller controllers in the network.
After the Task View page shows the logical devices have been created successfully, choose Configuration > Devices to view the new logical devices on the Devices page.

Note
The Chassis Number column shows the unique identifier for each logical device.
For the logical devices that you have created, click … and choose Generate Bootstrap Configuration.
(Optional) Attach a device template to the logical devices that you have created.
In the Generate Bootstrap Configuration dialog box, click Cloud-Init and then click OK.
The Generate Bootstrap Configuration dialog box shows the content of the bootstrap configuration, which includes the UUID of the logical device, and includes the configuration details provided by the device template if you have attached one.

Note
The UUID corresponds to the identifier in the Chassis Number column in the Devices table.
There are different methods for loading the bootstrap configuration onto a C8000V instance on a cloud service. The method you use depends on the cloud service. We recommend to click Download in the Generate Bootstrap Configuration dialog box to save a copy of the bootstrap configuration.
In the cloud services portal, create a PAYG instance of the Cisco Catalyst 8000V. When configuring the instance, use the bootstrap configuration that you created in Cisco vManage. The details of how to load the Cisco SD-WAN bootstrap configuration onto the instance are specific to the cloud services provider.

Note
On AWS, the workflow for bringing up an instance includes a user data step that enables loading the bootstrap configuration.
On the cloud service platform, start the Cisco Catalyst 8000V instance using the bootstrap configuration from an earlier step.
When the Cisco Catalyst 8000V instance boots up, it joins the Cisco SD-WAN overlay automatically. In Cisco vManage, on the Devices page, this Cisco Catalyst 8000V instance shows a green medal icon in the State column and In Sync in the Device Status column.

Note
On the Devices page, for logical devices that have not joined the Cisco SD-WAN overlay, the State column shows a dotted-circle icon.
Bootstrap Process for Cisco SD-WAN Cloud-Hosted Devices
Before You Begin
The device template provides the configuration details that enable the device to connect to Cisco vManage.
If you create a logical device and then generate a bootstrap configuration without first attaching a device template, the resulting file will include a minimal configuration. If you attach a device template to the logical device before generating the bootstrap configuration, the resulting file will include a more complete configuration, which can be helpful in enabling the device to connect to the Cisco SD-WAN overlay. We recommend that you attach a device template to the logical device before creating the bootstrap configuration.
This procedure is useful when onboarding a software device, such as the Cisco Catalyst 8000V, to a private cloud, such as KVM, ESXi, or OpenStack.
Bootstrap Process for Cisco SD-WAN Cloud-Hosted Devices
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Devices.
For the logical device (includes the UUID) that you are using for a new cloud-hosted instance, click … and choose Generate Bootstrap Configuration.
In the Generate Bootstrap Configuration dialog box, choose Cloud-Init and click OK. The Generate Bootstrap Configuration dialog box displays the bootstrap configuration, including the OTP token for the license, vBond address, UUID, and organization information.

Note
The UUID corresponds to the identifier in the Chassis Number column in the Devices table.

Note
Ensure that the bootstrap configuration does not include more interfaces than the virtual device instance has in the cloud environment.
There are different methods for loading the bootstrap configuration onto a device instance on a cloud service. The method you use depends on the cloud service. We recommend that you click Download in the Generate Bootstrap Configuration dialog box to save a copy of the bootstrap configuration.
You can use the bootstrap configuration when setting up a device instance in the cloud service. The configuration enables the device instance to connect to Cisco SD-WAN.
For information about onboarding a Cisco Catalyst 8000V in a private cloud, see the following:
Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge Software Installation And Configuration Guide, Installing in KVM Environments
Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge Software Installation And Configuration Guide, Installing in VMware ESXi Environment
Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge Software Installation And Configuration Guide, Installing in OpenStack
For example bootstrap configuration files for the Cisco Catalyst 8000V, see Cisco Catalyst 8000V Cloud Initialization Files.
Troubleshooting
Troubleshooting Software Installation
Router Loads the Previous Software Version After Booting
Router Loads the Previous Software Version After Booting
Router Loads the Previous Software Version After Booting
Problem
A router starts up using the previously installed software version.
Conditions
A router using Cisco IOS XE has two or more software versions installed.
Possible Causes
If the router begins booting up, and power cycles during the bootup, it may reboot using the previously installed software version.

Note
Cisco IOS XE devices have a mechanism that preserves the previously installed software version. As a safeguard against getting stuck during bootup with a corrupted software image, a device can fall back to the previously installed software version. This fallback can also occur if the device experiences a power cycle during bootup. In this case (power cycle during bootup), you can reboot the device to load the latest software.
Solutions
Check the active and inactive system software versions for a device using one of the following procedures:
Cisco vManage procedure:
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Monitor > Devices.
Click a device name in the Hostname column.
In the left pane, click Real Time.
In the Device Options field, enter Software Versions.
A table displays the installed software versions and indicates which version is active.
CLI procedure:
Execute the show sdwan software command in privileged EXEC mode to view the current active software version and the previous version.
Execute the show version command on the device, in privileged EXEC mode.
If the device is using the latest installed software version, the command output shows bootflash:packages.conf.
If the device is using the previous software version, the command output shows bootflash:prev_packages.conf.
Reboot the device and check the loaded system software again.
If the device boots again with the previous software version (bootflash:prev_packages.conf), contact Cisco TAC for assistance.
