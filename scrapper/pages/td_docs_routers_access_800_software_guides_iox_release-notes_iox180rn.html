Overview
Cisco IOx provides uniform and consistent hosting capabilities for various types of apps across Cisco platforms. This platform brings together Cisco IOS, the industry-leading networking operating system, and Linux, the leading open source platform. Linux-based applications can run on Cisco devices in the Cisco IOx framework, so using this platform, you can bring custom applications and interfaces to the network.
With Cisco IOx, developers can create a wide variety of IoT apps, such as data aggregation system and control systems.
New Features in Release 1.8.0
This release provide new features, including the following:
All /myapps and /localapps APIs have been deprecated and a single unified API /apps has been provided for all apps related operations.
Support to add authorized devices into Fog Director.
Subscription for alerts call back feature.
Support for installing any version of an app on a set of devices from Fog Director.
App health monitoring inside containers.
New appearance of apps dashboard on Fog Director.
Support for importing ova files into Fog Director.
Support for installing docker apps from Fog Director and Local Manager.
Support for installing docker apps from the docker hub without any additional IOx metadata.
IOx Services
Cisco provides micro services, which are a set of pre-built protocol handlers that help provide data acquisition capabilities from various devices into the IOx Services ecosystem. Applications can be built for these services to do edge computing and to send data to the cloud.
These micro services
are built using the IOx Services SDK (only supported on IR8xx platforms).
provide RESTful APIs to configure the service.
can access normalized data from the configured device through REST and Web Socket URIs provided by the north bound interface (NBI) gateway.
The following services are supported:
IOx Modbus
IOx DNP3
IOx GPS
IOx Motion
Supported Platforms
Cisco IOx Release 1.8.0 is supported on the following platforms:
  IR809
IR829
CGR compute module for CGR1120 and CGR1240
IR510
Note: If you have a new production IR809 or IR829, ensure you reboot the system after adding the basic IOx configurations.
Note: App life cycle management with an SSD hard disk is supported on the IR829 platform.
Image Information
Note: Before attempting a bundle image installation, stop the guest operating system by using following command on IOS:
guest-os 1 stop
Download the Cisco IOx images from the following DevNet page:

Upgrading Cisco Fog Director
You can upgrade Cisco Fog Director Release 1.7 to Cisco Fog Director Release 1.8. When you do so, your current Cisco Fog Director data is migrated to the new release.
Procedure
1. In the existing Cisco Fog Director 1.7 (from which you want to migrate to 1.8), navigate to the Settings tab.
2. Click Backup.
3. Provide a password with which the backup file will be encrypted. A backup file is generated.
4. Copy the backup file to your PC.
You can place the backup file in any location on the client PC and give it any name.
5. From a client PC, take these actions to obtain the VM OVA image for Cisco Fog Director 1.8:
a. Go to the following URL, and click the IOx Fog Director Software link in the Select a Software Type box:
https://software.cisco.com/download/type.html?mdfid=286290097&catid=null
b. Click the Download button that corresponds to the.ova file that you want.
c. Follow the on-screen instructions to download the file to your local drive.
6. Use the VM OVA image that you downloaded to deploy a VM for Cisco Fog Director 1.8.
7. Take these actions to update Cisco Fog Director 1.8 with the information in the backup file that you created:
a. Start and log in to Cisco Fog Director Release 1.8.
b. Click the Settings tab, and then click the Settings sub-tab.
The Settings page displays.
c. In the Backup & Restore area on the Settings page, click the RESTORE button.
The Restore dialog box displays.
d. In the Decryption password field in the Restore dialog box, enter the passphrase that you created for the backup file.
e. Click SELECT BACKUP ARCHIVE in the Restore dialog box, and then navigate to and select the backup file that you downloaded to the client PC.
The system updates Cisco Fog Director 1.8 with the information in the backup file. This process can take some time, depending on how much data is in the backup file.
When the upgrade completes, the Cisco Fog Director 1.8 Log In page displays.
Limitations and Restrictions
Upgrades of platform images must be performed from n -1’ to n release only ( n = the latest release).
After an IR8xx platform upgrade from version 1.6.0 to 1.7.0, the available disk will be 262 MB instead of 607 MB. This behavior is only observed on platforms which are not disk-repartitioned.
If the IOx Core service bundle is corrupted and does not get into the RUNNING state, the bundle’s dependent services and apps also will not get into the RUNNING state. To resolve this issue, reactivate the dependent services.
To reflect the latest status of the IOx Core services container on the FD GUI, perform a device refresh. For example, if you install the GPS service, the core service automatically gets started. However, the status will not be reflected on FD GUI unless you refresh the device.
If CAF crashes abruptly, CAF comes back up with limited functionality. If app management services are down you can download the tech support logs and verify the reason from the CAF logs or in syslog files. An example for app management going down is a CAF abrupt crash.
The workaround is to reboot the device. If the app management services are down after the device reboots, collect the tech support logs from the device before contacting the support team.
App asking for multiple USB ports and devices is not supported. This restriction applies only to FD.
USB device hot swap-out and swap-in are not supported. You must plug in the USB device before installation the application on the IOx device.
Editing or stopping of service packages should be done only after uninstalling the dependent app.
