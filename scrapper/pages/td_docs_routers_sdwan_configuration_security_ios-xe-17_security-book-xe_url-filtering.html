Chapter: URL Filtering
Chapter Contents
The URL Filtering feature enables the user to provide controlled access to Internet websites or Intranet sites by configuring the URL-based policies and filters on the device. The user can configure the URL Filtering profiles to manage the web access. The URL Filtering feature is implemented using the security virtual image similar to the IPS feature.

Note
A NAT direct internet access route is necessary to implement URL Filtering.
URL Filtering can either allow or deny access to a specific URL based on:
Allowed list and blocked list: These are static rules, which helps the user to either allow or deny URLs. If the same pattern is configured under both the allowed and blocked lists, the traffic is allowed.
Category: URLs can be classified into multiple categories such as News, Social Media, Education, Adult and so on. Based on the requirements, user has the option to block or allow one or more categories.
Reputation: Each URL has a reputation score associated with it. The reputation score range is from 0-100, and it is categorized as: high-risk (reputation score (0-20), suspicious (21-40), moderate-risk (41-60), low-risk (61-80), and trustworthy (81-100). Based on the reputation score of a URL and the configuration, a URL is either blocked or allowed.
When there is no allowed list or blocked list configured on the device, based on the category and reputation of the URL, traffic is allowed or blocked using a block page. For HTTP(s), a block page is not displayed and the traffic is dropped.

Overview of URL Filtering
The URL Filtering feature enables the user to provide controlled access to Internet websites by configuring the URL-based policies and filters on the device.
The URL Filtering feature allows a user to control access to Internet websites by permitting or denying access to specific websites based on the category, reputation, or URL. For example, when a client sends a HTTP/HTTP(s) request through the router, the HTTP/HTTP(s) traffic is inspected based on the URL Filtering policies (allowed list/ blocked list, Category, and Reputation). If the HTTP/HTTP(s) request matches the blocked list, the HTTP(s) request is blocked by an inline block page response. If the HTTP/HTTP(s) request matches the allowed list, the traffic is allowed without further URL Filtering inspection.
For HTTPS traffic, the inline block page is not displayed. URL Filtering will not decode any encoded URL before performing a lookup. Because the SSL/TLS session is still being established at the time it is determined the request should be blocked, the client is not expected to receive a HTTP response, whether it is the injected HTTP blocked page or redirect URL, which causes a protocol error to occur.
In Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN, a HTTP response can be inserted into the HTTPS session if this traffic is routed through SSL/TLS proxy. The SSL/TLS session is allowed to establish in this case, and when the HTTP GET is received on the decrypted HTTPS session, the HTTP blocked page or redirect URL is injected and it is accepted by the client.
Database Overview
Filtering Options
Cloud-Lookup
Database Overview
By default, WAN Edge routers do not download the URL database from the cloud.
To enable the URL database download:
prior to Cisco vManage Release 20.5, you must set the Resource Profile to High in the App-hosting Security Feature Template.
from Cisco vManage Release 20.5 onwards, you must enable Download URL Database on Device in the App-hosting Security Feature Template.
Additional memory is required to download the URL database.
If configured, WAN Edge routers download the URL database from the cloud. After the full database is downloaded from the cloud, if there are any updates to the existing database, the incremental updates will be automatically downloaded every 15 minutes. The complete database size is approximately 440 MB and the downloaded database should always synchronize with the cloud. The database will be invalid if the connection to the cloud is lost for more than 24 hours. The default URL category/reputation database only has a few IP address based records. The category/reputation look up occurs only when the host portion of the URL has the domain name.
If the device does not get the database updates from the cloud, vManage ensures that the traffic designated for URL Filtering is not dropped.

Note
The URL Filtering database is periodically updated from the cloud in every 15 minutes.
Filtering Options
The URL Filtering allows you to filter traffic using the following options:
Category-Based Filtering
Reputation-Based Filtering
List-based Filtering
Category-Based Filtering
URLs can be classified into multiple categories such as News, Social Media, Education, Adult and so on. Based on the requirements, user has the option to block or allow one or more categories.
A URL may be associated with up to five different categories. If any of these categories match a configured blocked category, then the request will be blocked.
Reputation-Based Filtering
In addition to category-based filtering, you can also filter based on the reputation of the URL. Each URL has a reputation score associated with it. The reputation score range is from 0-100 and it is categorized as:
High risk: Reputation score of 0 to 20
Suspicious: Reputation score of 21 to 40
Moderate risk: Reputation score of 41 to 60
Low risk: Reputation score of 61 to 80
Trustworthy: Reputation score of 81 to 100
When you configure a web reputation in vManage, you are setting a reputation threshold. Any URL that is below the threshold is blocked by URL filtering. For example, if you set the web reputation to Moderate Risk in vManage, any URL that has a reputation score below than and equal to 60 is blocked.
Based on the reputation score of a URL and the configuration, a URL is either blocked or allowed.
List-based Filtering
List-based filtering allows the user to control access by permitting or denying access based on allowed or blocked lists. Here are some important points to note regarding these lists:
URLs that are allowed are not subjected to any category-based filtering (even if they are configured).
If the same item is configured under both the allowed and blocked list, the traffic is allowed.
If the traffic does not match either the allowed or blocked lists, then it is subjected to category-based and reputation-based filtering (if configured).
You can consider using a combination of allowed and blocked pattern lists to design the filters. For example, if you want to allow www\.foo\.com but also want to block other URLs such as www\.foo\.abc and www\.foo\.xyz, you can configure www\.foo\.com in the allowed list and www\.foo\. in the blocked list.

Note
If you are using the www prefix in the allowed or blocked regex pattern, it can create a problem if the Server Name Indicator (SNI) returned in the client message doesn't match. For example, if you want to allow www./foo./com and SNI returns as foo.com only. We recommend not to include the www in the regex match.
Cloud-Lookup
The Cloud-Lookup feature is enabled by default and is used to retrieve the category and reputation score of URLs that are not available in the local database.
The category and reputation score of unknown URLs are returned as follows:
Name based URLs:
Valid URL — corresponding category and reputation score is received.
Unknown URL (new URL or unknown to the cloud) — category is 'uncategorized' and reputation score is 40
Internal URLs with proper domain name (for example, internal.abc.com) — category and reputation score is based on the base domain name (abc.com from the example above).
Completely internal URLs (for example, abc.xyz) — category is 'uncategorized' and reputation score is 40
IP based URLs:
Public hosted IP — corresponding category and reputation score is received.
Private IP like 10.<>, 192.168.<> — category is 'uncategorized' and reputation score is 100
Non-hosted/Non-routable IP — category is 'uncategorized' and reputation score is 40
The Cloud-Lookup score is different from the on-box database for these URLs (Unknown/Non-hosted/Non-routable/Internal URLs).
Configure and Apply URL Filtering
To configure and apply URL Filtering to a Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device, do the following:
Before you Begin
Configure URL Filtering
