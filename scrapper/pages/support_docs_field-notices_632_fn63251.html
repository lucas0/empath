Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCvf34445 There were no defects filed with this field notice at the time of publication.
Problem Description
The Redundant Power Supply (RPS) cover that is included in the accessory kit for the affected Cisco Catalyst 3560V2 and 3750V2 Series switches is the incorrect size. For customers who choose to mount the affected switches vertically, this might be a safety issue, as the RPS cover does not fit properly over the RPS connector. Without the proper RPS cover present over the RPS connector, it is possible for material to escape from within the switch.
Background
All Cisco Catalyst 3560V2 and 3750V2 Series switches (except the DC Version) that shipped before June 5, 2009, are affected (includes all serial numbers LLL1323NNNN and earlier).
Problem Symptom
For the affected Cisco Catalyst 3560V2 and 3750V2 Series switches that are mounted vertically, the RPS cover does not fit properly over the RPS connector.
Workaround/Solution
In order to determine whether a Cisco Catalyst 3560V2 or 3750V2 Series switch is affected, please use the Serial Number Validation (SNV) Tool.
For affected products with serial numbers that are verified by the SNV Tool, please contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) and request a hardware replacement.
