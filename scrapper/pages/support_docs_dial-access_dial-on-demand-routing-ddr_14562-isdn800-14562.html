Introduction
In certain situations, you would need to configure a router to dial multiple sites. For example, you may have to dial one router to connect to a part of your corporate network, and dial the Internet Service Provider (ISP) router to connect to the Internet.
This document presents a configuration example in which a central router accesses the Internet, and a remote office uses Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN). The remote office can also access the central router and the Internet through the central router.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Before you proceed with this configuration, ensure that you:
Verify that ISDN Layer 1 and 2 are up. For more information, see Using the show isdn status Command for BRI Troubleshooting.
Obtain the necessary information from the ISP, such as the authentication method, which could be Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) or Password Authentication Protocol (PAP), the username and password, the number to dial, and the IP address for the dialer interface (unless the interface uses a negotiated address). Also, find out if NAT is needed to connect multiple hosts to the ISP.
From the remote router, obtain information about the authentication method, username and password, the number to dial, and the IP address.
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
Cisco 803 router with Cisco IOS® Software Release 12.1(11) IP plus.
Note: If you need to configure NAT, ensure that you have the IP Plus (it has an "is" in the IOS file name) feature set.
Cisco 2501 router, which is the remote office that runs Cisco IOS Software Release 12.2(5).
Note: The configuration for the ISP router is not included. Refer to the Dial and Access Technology Support page for some example configurations.
The information presented in this document was created from devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If you are working in a live network, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command before using it.

Related Products
This configuration can be used with any router with a Basic Rate Interface (BRI) interface. This includes routers with built-in BRI interfaces, such as Cisco 800 (for example, 801, 802, 803, 804) and Cisco 1600 (for example, 1603-R and 1604-R) Series Routers. It also includes routers that accept BRI WAN Interface Cards (WICs) or Network Modules, like the 1600, 1700, 2600 and 3600 Series. For more information on BRI WICs or Network Modules, refer to WAN Interface Card (WIC) / Platform Hardware Compatibility Matrix for 1600, 1700, 2600 and 3600 Series Routers.
Note: Use the show version command to check whether your router has a BRI interface.
Configure
In this section, you are presented with the information to configure the features described in this document.

Network Diagram
This document uses this network setup:
Configurations
In this configuration, the central router is named "central" and the remote corporate office is named "remote".
On central, dialer interface 1 is configured to access the Internet. The IP address is dynamically assigned by the ISP. NAT is used to allow the IP networks of the central LAN, remote LAN, and central-remote WAN to access the Internet with the help of one dynamically-assigned IP address. Contact your ISP to check whether you need NAT.
Note: We have configured both PAP and CHAP, because this depends on what the ISP has configured (however, only one of them is used).

Verify
This section provides information you can use to confirm your configuration is working properly.
Certain show commands are supported by the Output Interpreter Tool (registered customers only) , which allows you to view an analysis of show command output.
show isdn active—shows the ISDN number you have used to place the call, and indicates whether the call is inbound or outbound.
show caller ip—displays a summary of caller information for the IP address you provide.
show ip interface dialer 1 | include Internet—lists a summary of a dialer interface's IP information and status.
show dialer [interface type number]—displays general diagnostic information for interfaces configured for dial-on-demand routing (DDR). If the dialer came up properly, this message appears:
Dialer state is data link layer up
If physical layer up appears, it implies that the line protocol came up, but the Network Control Protocol (NCP) did not. The source and destination addresses of the packet that initiated the dialing are shown in the Dial reason line. This show command also displays the configuration of the timer, and the time before the connection times out.
Troubleshoot
This section provides information you can use to troubleshoot your configuration.
Troubleshooting Commands
Certain show commands are supported by the Output Interpreter Tool (registered customers only) , which allows you to view an analysis of show command output.
Note: Before issuing debug commands, please see Important Information on Debug Commands.
debug dialer—displays debugging information about the packets or events on a dialer interface.
debug isdn q931—displays information about call setup and teardown of ISDN network connections (Layer 3) between the local router (user side) and the network.
debug ppp negotiation—displays information on Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) traffic and exchanges during the negotiation of PPP components, and includes information on Link Control Protocol (LCP), Authentication, and NCP. A successful PPP negotiation will first open the LCP state, then Authenticate, and finally negotiate NCP.
debug ppp authentication—causes the debug ppp command to display authentication protocol messages, including CHAP packet exchanges and PAP exchanges.
debug ip peer—contains information on the peer.
Debug Output
To troubleshoot the configuration, use these debugs:
   central#debug isdn q931 
   ISDN Q931 packets debugging is on 
   
   central#debug dialer 
   Dial on demand events debugging is on
