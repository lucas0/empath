Objective
The User Management page of the FindIT Network Manager and FindIT Network Probe allows you to define users that can access the FindIT Network, and also allows you to implement password complexity requirements and session settings for those users.
FindIT Network supports two types of users: admin and operator. An admin has full access to the FindIT Network features, while an operator can do everything except managing users. When the FindIT Network Manager is first installed, a default admin user is created with the username and password both set to cisco.
This article provides instructions on how to add, edit, or delete users, and change password complexity and user session settings.
