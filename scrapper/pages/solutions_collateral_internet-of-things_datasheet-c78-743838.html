Document history
    Cisco® Edge Intelligence is a software offering, designed for Cisco IoT edge devices, that simplifies the secure delivery of IoT data to the right applications at the right time, either at the edge or in the cloud.
Product overview
Internet of Things (IoT) discussions have moved from counting the number of connected devices to describing use cases and value for each industry. Organizations in every industry are looking to translate IoT edge data into meaningful information and derive business value. Cisco Edge Intelligence radically simplifies the IoT edge, with multicloud data delivery and control for connected assets.
Cisco Edge Intelligence is a software offering that extracts, transforms, governs, and delivers connected asset data from the IoT edge to multicloud destinations with granular data control. It is a software service deployed on Cisco’s Industrial IoT (IIoT) networking portfolio for easy, out-of-the box deployment.
The benefits of Cisco Edge Intelligence include the ability to leverage edge data for insights immediately. Instead of pushing data all the way to your cloud before analyzing it, you can now take action immediately based on the values of attributes right at the edge. Additionally, with the continued growth of sensors and connected assets, you can use Edge Intelligence to easily reduce the amount of data sent to your cloud back end: send data only when the value changes, send data only when a threshold is reached, or specify your sampling frequency at will. Cisco Edge Intelligence provides a robust toolkit of capabilities to increase your efficiency and improve your edge-to-edge data visibility from day one.
Current approaches require custom software and integration of multiple vendor technologies that are complex to deploy and manage. In addition, current offerings are further challenged with no easy way to control what data is delivered to specific applications running in multicloud environments. Cisco Edge Intelligence enables organizations to regain ownership of and control over IoT edge data by providing:
●      Out-of-the-box service on Cisco’s IIoT networking portfolio
●      A simplified user experience and scaled centralized deployment
●      Seamless data extraction from a variety of data sources
●      Developer-friendly tools to create intelligent data logic for IoT edge execution
●      The ability to govern the flow of IoT data at granular levels before data leaves the operational environments
●      Preintegration with leading IoT platforms and applications to easily share data from the IoT edge to multicloud destinations
Features and benefits

Integrated industrial device connectivity
Edge Intelligence provides various industry-standard connectors such as Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA), MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Modbus TCP, and NTCIP 1202-1204, and integrates seamlessly with your environment.
Asset data model editor
Customize data models that describe exactly what data will be extracted from your assets. Create centralized configurations that can be scaled for your entire deployment. Custom attributes can be implemented to allow per-asset customization if needed, and our Data Logic engine has full access to asset attributes. Learn more
Data Logic engine
Deploy custom logic using JavaScript to transform data at the edge. Use data logic to sample high-frequency data streams, apply transformation logic, perform rule-based range validation, or normalize data, depending on specific needs. Learn more
Microsoft Visual Studio (VS) Code plug-in
Simplify development of data logic by leveraging standard development tools. Learn more
Intuitive data rules creation
Achieve fine-grained control to help ensure that the right data is delivered to the right applications. Data from any source can be filtered at the attribute level and delivered to multiple selected applications. Implement simple data rules within our cloud-based UI if no data logic rules are needed. Learn more
Multicloud application data integration
Deliver your data to any application, either cloud hosted or at the edge, using built-in connectivity to services such as Microsoft Azure IoT Hub or industry-standard protocols such as MQTT. Multicloud delivery allows you to connect multiple data pipelines to one asset for advanced use cases.
Role-based access control
Use segmented configuration and operation to control who has access to what elements of the configuration and operation of your Edge Intelligence solution.
Audit trail
Log all operations in Edge Intelligence to help ensure accountability for the integrity of your solution configuration and deployment.
Security
Deploy industry-leading built-in security that protects your data and your business. Edge applications are protected through a comprehensive security architecture anchored to a hardware root of trust and built-in Transport Layer Security (TLS).
Centralized administration
Use the cloud-based management software to create all aspects of your edge stack configuration in a centralized place, including data models, data logic, destinations, and policies, to greatly simplify the deployment of these pieces at massive scale.
Scalability
Manage the lifecycle of an edge stack and associated workflows on thousands of Cisco network devices.
Operational health monitoring
Gain real-time visibility into the operational state of the Edge Intelligence agents and the execution state of deployed policies.
Prominent features
Cisco Edge Intelligence is unique in that it is the only IoT solution that unlocks business value by simplifying the entire data flow from the edge of the network to multiple cloud environments. It is an integrated IoT edge stack managed through an intuitive user interface that helps ensure security and governance of IIoT data, either locally at the edge or in a multicloud environment. These major features and benefits are presented through four distinct steps: extract (the data from disparate sources), transform (the data by applying policies), govern (the data as to where and who gets access to it), and deliver (the data securely to its destination).
●      Extract data from diverse, distributed devices: Edge Intelligence includes industry-standard connectors such as OPC UA, Modbus, and MQTT that allow the solution to ingest data from disparate sources. No coding is needed – data sources are configured via simple web-based UIs. Ingested data is converted to industry-standard formats such as JSON.
●      Transform data at the edge: Perform microprocessing on data close to the source. Create scripts using JavaScript that filter, compress, or analyze data. You can aggregate multiple data points from various sources to gain actionable insights into trends and patterns through real-time intelligent processing. Edge Intelligence developer tools are fully integrated with an industry-leading Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (Microsoft VS Code) for ease of development. Learn more
●      Define streamlined data rules: Create data rules for the edge from our cloud UI. Choose which data points (right down to the data attribute level) are sent to which destinations. For example, you can have all production data from assets go to an internal database for compliance reasons, and send environmental data to a real-time predictive maintenance application.
●      Deliver data anywhere: Data can be delivered to applications either on at the edge or in the cloud. Use built-in connectors to share data with industry-leading cloud vendors, or choose industry-agnostic protocols such as MQTT.
●      Monitor the ongoing operation of your IoT solution: Ongoing monitoring of the key components of Edge Intelligence helps ensure that any outages can be quickly diagnosed and fixed. Health status events and alerts are accessible from the cloud UI, and are generated for critical components of your IoT deployment.

Licensing
Cisco Edge Intelligence is licensed as a subscription. Licenses are divided into two groups: base functionality and industry-specific device adapters. A base license defines the general set of agent capabilities available for the agent and is required for each Cisco network device that will run an Edge Intelligence agent. An additional industry-specific device adapter license may be purchased for each agent when industry-specific device connectivity is needed.
One base license must be purchased for each hardware device that will run the Cisco Edge Intelligence agent. Additional device adapter licenses may be purchased for specific industry use cases.
