Alarms
When something of interest happens on an individual device in the overlay network, the device reports it by sending a notification to Cisco vManage. Cisco vManage then filters the event notifications and correlates related events, and it consolidates major and critical events into alarms.
Use the Alarms screen to display detailed information about alarms generated by controllers and routers in the overlay network.
The table below lists the alarms that the Cisco vManage software generates. The software generates alarms when a state or condition changes, such as when a software component starts, transitions from down to up, or transitions from up to down. The severity indicates the seriousness of the alarm. When you create email notifications, the severity that you configure in the notification determines which alarms you can receive email notifications about.

Use the debug platform packet-trace command to configure a packet tracer on edge devices with various conditions such as bidirectional, VPN, circular, destination IP, source IP, interface, start, stop, logging, and clear.
Configure Packet Trace on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices
Enable packet trace for the traffic and specify the maximum number of packets:
Device# debug platform packet-trace packet [number of traced packets]
Specify the matching criteria for tracing packets. Matching criteria provides the ability to filter by protocol, IP address and subnet mask, interface, and direction:
Device# debug platform condition [interface interface name] {match ipv4|ipv6|mac src dst}  {both|ingress|egress} [bidirectional]
Enable MPLS output label trace. A MPLS output label trace is included in debug path to reduce the impact on performance.
Device# debug platform hardware qfp active feature cef-mpls datapath mpls all
Enable the specified matching criteria and start packet tracing:
Device# debug platform condition start
Deactivate the condition and stop packet tracing:
Device# debug platform condition stop
Exit the privileged EXEC mode:
exit
Configure Packet Trace on Cisco vEdge devices
The following example shows how to configure conditions for packet tracing:
Device# debug packet-trace condition source-ip 10.1.1.1
Device# debug packet-trace condition vpn-id 0
Device# debug packet-trace condition interface ge0/1
Device# debug packet-trace condition stop
For more information, see debug packet-trace condition command page.
Configure SNMP Traps on Cisco vEdge Devices
The SNMP traps are asynchronous notifications that a Cisco device sends to an SNMP management server. Traps notify the management server of events, whether normal or significant, that occur on the device. By default, SNMP traps aren’t sent to an SNMP server. Note that for SNMPv3, the PDU type for notifications is either SNMPv2c inform (InformRequest-PDU) or trap (Trapv2-PDU).
To configure SNMP traps, define the traps and configure the SNMP server that receives the traps.

Note
The trap group UI option isn’t supported from Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.1.1 and later.
To configure groups of traps to be collected on Cisco vEdge devices, use the trap group command:

Note
You don't need to configure groups of traps on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
vEdge(config-snmp)#  trap group group-name
vEdge(config-group)# trap-type level severity
A single trap group can contain multiple trap types. In the configuration, specify one trap type per line, and each trap type can have one, two, or three severity levels. See the following configuration example for an illustration of the configuration process.
To configure the SNMP server to receive the traps, use the trap target command on Cisco vEdge devices:

Note
You don't need to configure the SNMP server to receive the traps on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
vedge(config-snmp)#  trap target vpn  vpn-id ipv4-address udp-port
vedge(config-target)# group-name name
vedge(config-target)# community-name community-name
vedge(config-target)# source-interface interface-name
For each SNMP server, specify the identifier of VPN where the server is located, the server's IPv4 address, and the UDP port on the server to connect to. When configuring the trap server's address, you must use an IPv4 address. You can’t use an IPv6 address.
In the group-name command, associate a previously configured trap group with the server. The traps in that group are sent to the SNMP server.
In the community-name command, associate a previously configure SNMP community with the SNMP server.
In the source-interface command, configure the interface to use to send traps to the SNMP server that is receiving the trap information. This interface cannot be a subinterface.
In the following configuration example, all traps are sent to one SNMP server and only critical traps to another SNMP server. Two SNMP trap groups and the two target SNMP servers are configured:
vEdge# config

Syslog Messages
When something of interest happens on an individual device in the overlay network, one of the ways the device reports it is by generating a system logging (syslog) message and place it in a syslog file in the /var/log directory on the local device and, if configured, on a remote device.
On Cisco SD-WAN devices, you can log event notification system log (syslog) messages to files on the local device or on a remote host, or both. On the local device, syslog files are placed in the /var/log directory.
Configure System Logging
Logging syslog messages with a priority level of "error," to the local device's hard disk, is enabled by default. Log files are placed in the local /var/log directory. By default, log files are 10 MB in size, and up to 10 files are stored. After 10 files have been created, the oldest one is discarded to create a file for newer syslog messages.
To modify the default syslog parameters from Cisco vManage, use the Logging feature template. From the CLI, include the logging disk or logging server commands in the device configuration.
View Syslog Logging Information
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Administration > Settings and, ensure that Data Stream is enabled.
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Monitor > Devices, and choose a device from the list of devices that appears.

Syslog messages at or above the default or configured priority value are recorded in a number of files in the /var/log directory on the local device. These files include the following:
auth.log—Login, logout, and superuser access events, and usage of authorization systems.
kern.log—Kernel messages
messages—Consolidated log file that contains syslog messages from all sources
vconfd—All configuration-related syslog messages
vdebug—All debug messages for modules whose debugging is turned on and all syslog messages above the configured priority value. Debug logging supports various levels of logging based on the module. Different modules implement the logging levels differently. For example, the system manager (sysmgr) has two logging levels (on and off), while the chassis manager (chmgr) has four different logging levels (off, low, normal, and high). You cannot send debug messages to a remote host. To enable debugging, use the debug operational command
vsyslog—All syslog messages from Cisco SD-WAN processes (daemons) above the configured priority value. The default priority value is "informational" (severity level 6), so by default, all "notice", "warning", "error", "critical", "alert", and "emergency" syslog messages (severity levels 5 through 0, respectively) are saved
The Cisco SD-WAN software does not use the following standard LINUX files, which are present in /var/log, for logging: cron.log, debug, lpr.log, mail.log, and syslog.
The writing of messages to syslog files is not rate-limited. This means that if many syslog messages are generated in a short amount of time, the overflow messages are buffered and placed in a queue until they can be written to a syslog file. The overflow messages are not dropped.
For repeating syslog messages—identical messages that occur multiple times in succession—only one copy of the message is placed in the syslog file. The message is annotated to indicate the number of times that the message occurred.
The maximum length of a syslog message is 1024 bytes. Longer messages are truncated.
Syslog messages related to AAA authentication and Netconf CLI access and usage are placed in the auth.log and messages files. Each time Cisco vManage logs in to a Cisco vEdge device to retrieve statistics and status information and to push files to the router, the router generates AAA and Netconf log messages. So, over time, these messages can fill the log files. To prevent these messages from filling the log files, you can disable the logging of AAA and Netconf syslog messages:
Device(config)# system aaa logsViptela(config-logs)# audit-disableViptela(config-logs)# netconf-disable
            
Syslog Message Format
Syslog message generated by the Cisco SD-WAN software have the following format:
                facility.source
                date - source - module - level - MessageID: text-of-syslog-message
            
Here is an example syslog message. This is logged with local7 facility and level "notice".

Syslog Messages
The tables below list the syslog messages generated by Cisco vEdge devices and Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. The messages are grouped based on the software module that generates them. The software modules are typically processes (daemons) that run on the device.
All syslog messages are generated on all the devices unless otherwise indicated.
Each syslog message has a corresponding number. The tables list all syslog messages and their number even if the messages are defined in the header files but are not currently used in the operating software. For these messages, the Message Format, Description, and Action fields are empty.
In these tables, the Action field indicates the recommended action you should take in response to the syslog message:
A—Automatically open a ticket in your organization's support team.
AE—Automatically open a support ticket and escalate the ticket
E—Send email to the appropriate team within your organization.
If you see a syslog message that is not listed in one of the tables below, please send the message, along with the device and software version, to Cisco support.

Troubleshoot WiFi Connections
This topic describes how to check and resolve connection problems between a WiFi client and a WiFi network that is provided by a WiFi router. The procedures described here are applicable to devices that support WiFi only.
Check for WiFi Connection Problems
If a WiFi client is unable to connect to a WiFi network when a router is providing the WiFi network, follow these steps to determine the source of the problem. To perform each step, use a method appropriate for the WiFi client.
Verify that the WiFi client can locate the service identifier (SSID) advertised by the router. If the client cannot find the SSID, see the section, SSID Not Located.
Verify that the WiFi client can connect to the SSID advertised by the router. If the client cannot connect to the SSID, see the section, SSID Connection Fails.
Verify that the WiFi client has been assigned an IP address. If the client cannot obtain an IP address, see the section, Missing IP Address.
Verify that the WiFi client can access the Internet. If the client cannot connect to the Internet, see section, Internet Connection Failure.
If the WiFi client connection is slow or if you notice frequent disconnects, see section, WiFi Speed Is Slow.
Resolve Problems with WiFi Connections
This section describes the most common issues that occur with WiFi connections between a WiFi client and a router, and it describes steps to resolve the issues.
SSID Not Located
Problem Statement
The WiFi client cannot locate the SSID advertised by the router.
Resolve the Problem
Ensure that the basic service set identifier (BSSID) address for the SSID is valid:
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Monitor > Devices.
Cisco vManage Release 20.6.x and earlier: From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Monitor > Network.
Choose a device from the device list that appears.
From the left pane, choose WiFi. The right pane displays information about WiFi configuration on the router.
In the right pane, locate the SSID. Check that the BSSID for this SSID does not have a value of 00:00:00:00:00:00.
If the BSSID is 00:00:00:00:00:00, the WLAN (VAP) interface for this SSID may be misconfigured. Ensure that the WLAN interface has been added to a bridge during the configuration process. To view the running configuration of the device, from the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Devices. For the desired device, click ...and choose Running Configuration.
To view the running configuration of the device from the CLI, run the show running-config command. To add the WLAN interface to a bridge — from the Cisco vManage, choose Configuration > Templates.
Click Feature Templates, and choose the Bridge feature template.

Note
In Cisco vManage Release 20.7.x and earlier releases, Feature Templates is titled Feature.
Eliminate static channels. A static channel is one where you explicitly configure the radio channel rather than allowing the router to automatically select the best radio channel. A slow static channel may appear to be an unreachable SSID.
View the current SSID channel setting for the router. To do this, from the Cisco vManage menu, choose Monitor > Devices and choose a device from the list of devices that appears. Then click Real Time, and in the Device Options drop-down list, choose WLAN Clients or WLAN Radios.
From the CLI, run the show wlan clients or show wlan radios command.
If the channel is set to a specific number, change the value to "auto". To do this, use the WiFi Radio feature template in Cisco vManage.
From the CLI, run the wlan channel auto command.
Ensure that the WiFi client is using the same radio band as the router, either 2.4 GHz (for IEEE 802.11b/g/n) or 5 GHz (for IEEE802.11a/n/ac):
Check which radio band the WiFi client supports.
Check the router’s Select Radio setting. To do this, from the Cisco vManage menu, choose Monitor > Devices and choose a device from the device list that appears. Then click Real Time, and in the Device Options drop-down list, choose WLAN Radios.
From the CLI, run the show wlan radios command.
If the router and WiFi client radio band settings do not match, either change the WiFi client's radio band or change the settings on the router so that they match. To do this, use the Wifi Radio feature template.
From the CLI, run the wlan command.
SSID Connection Fails
Problem Statement
The WiFi client can locate the SSID advertised by the router but cannot connect to it.
Resolve the Problem
If you configure passwords locally on the router, ensure that the WiFi client's password matches the SSID's password.
If you are using a RADIUS server, ensure that the RADIUS server is reachable and that the WiFi client's username and password match the RADIUS configuration:
To verify that the RADIUS server is reachable from the router, ping the server. To do this in Cisco vManage, ping a device. From the CLI, run the ping command.
Check for matching passwords on the RADIUS server and WiFi client.
Ensure that you do not exceed the maximum number of clients for this SSID:
Verify the number of used clients and the maximum number of clients:
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Monitor > Devices and choose a device from the device list that appears. From the left pane, select WiFi. In the right pane, locate the SSID. Check the No. of Clients field. If the used/maximum values are equal, no more clients can connect to this SSID.
From the CLI, run the show wlan interfaces detail command.
If needed, increase the maximum clients setting for your SSID. To do this use the WiFi SSID feature template in Cisco vManage.
From the CLI, run the max-clients command.
Ensure that the WiFi client supports WPA2 management security:
Check your Management Security setting. To do this, from the Cisco vManage menu, choose Monitor > Devices and choose a device from the device list that appears. Then click Real Time, and in the Device Options drop-down list, choose WLAN Interfaces.
From the CLI, run the show wlan interfaces command. If the management security value is set to "required," the WiFi client must support WPA2 security.
If necessary, change the Management Security setting for your SSID to "optional" or "none." To do this in Cisco vManage, use the WiFi SSID feature template.
From the CLI, run the mgmt-security command.
Missing IP Address
Problem Statement
The WiFi client can connect to the SSID, but cannot obtain an IP address.
Resolve the Problem
Ensure that a DHCP server is reachable and has an available IP address in its address pool:
If the router is acting as a DHCP helper (DHCP relay agent), ping the DHCP server to ensure that it is reachable from the router.. From the CLI, run the ping command.
If you are using a remote DHCP server, check that the remote DHCP server has an available IP address in its address pool.
If the router is acting as the local DHCP server:
View the number of addresses being used. From the Cisco vManage menu, Monitor > Devices and choose a device from the device list that appears. Next, click Real Time, and from the Device Options drop-down list, choose DHCP Servers.
From the CLI, run the show dhcp server command.
Compute the number of IP addresses in the pool based on the configured DHCP address pool size and the number of addresses excluded from the DHCP address pool. To view these values in Cisco vManage, from the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Devices. For the desired router, click ... and choose Running Configuration.
To view them from the CLI, run the show running-config command.
If necessary, increase the range of addresses in the router's DHCP address pool using the DHCP-Server feature template in Cisco vManage.
Internet Connection Failure
Problem Statement
The WiFi client is connected to the SSID and has an IP address, but it cannot connect to the Internet.
Resolve the Problem
Ensure that the WiFi client has received the correct default gateway and DNS settings from the DHCP server:
If the DHCP server is remote, check the settings on the server.
If the router is the DHCP server, ensure that the default gateway and DNS server settings are the same as those on the WiFi client. To view the settings in Cisco vManage, from the Cisco vManage menu, choose Monitor > Devices, and choose a device from the device list that is displayed. Click Real Time, and in the Device Options drop-down list, choose DHCP Interfaces.
From the CLI, run the show dhcp interface  command.
WiFi Speed Is Slow
Problem Statement
The WiFi client can connect to the Internet, but the connection speed is slow.
Resolve the Problem
Allow the router to choose the best WiFi channel:
View the current SSID channel setting for the router. To do this in Cisco vManage, from the Cisco vManage menu, choose Monitor > Devices, and choose a device from the device list that is displayed. Click Real Time, and in the Device Options drop-down list, choose WLAN Clients.
From the CLI, run the show wlan clients or show wlan radios command.
If the channel is set to a specific number, change the value to "auto". To do this in Cisco vManage, use the WiFi Radio feature template.
From the CLI, run the wlan channel auto command.
