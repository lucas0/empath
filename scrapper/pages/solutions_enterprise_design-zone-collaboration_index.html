Deploying collaboration solutions
Learn about the preferred architectures and system designs for implementing Cisco collaboration technologies.
Cisco collaboration solutions include technologies for:
Voice and video communications
Voice messaging
Conferencing
Instant messaging and presence
Business-to-business communications
Public switched telephone network (PSTN) access
Mobile and remote access
Cisco offers two main types of design guidance for collaboration solutions: Preferred Architectures and Solution Reference Network Designs.
Preferred Architectures
Cisco has developed, tested, and documented Preferred Architectures for specific market segments. These deployment models incorporate a subset of products from the Cisco collaboration portfolio.
Preferred Architectures are prescriptive, out-of-the-box models based on common use cases. They are designed to scale with an organization as its business needs change. This approach simplifies the integration of multiple system-level components.
Preferred Architectures are tailored to two main market segments:
Midmarket: small and medium-sized businesses with up to 1000 users
Enterprise: Large businesses with more than 1000 users
Preferred Architectures are documented in presales design overviews and postsales Cisco Validated Design (CVD) guides. Both are available on the Collaboration Preferred Architectures page.
Solution Reference Network Designs
Cisco Solution Reference Network Designs provide detailed design guidelines, recommendations, and deployment models. They help sales teams and customers design their own solutions to meet requirements that may be outside the scope of a Preferred Architecture.
While a Preferred Architecture presents a single solution design and deployment model, a Network Design explores various options and offers recommendations on which design works best in a specific deployment scenario. Solution Reference Network Designs are broader in scope but less specific in deployment details than Preferred Architectures.
The Solution Reference Network Design (SRND) guides are available on the Collaboration Solutions Design Guidance page.
