Overview
Cisco IOx provides uniform and consistent hosting capabilities for various types of apps across various Cisco platforms. This platform brings together Cisco IOS, the industry-leading networking operating system, and Linux, the leading open source platform. Linux-based applications can run on Cisco devices in the Cisco IOx framework, so using this platform, you can bring custom applications and interfaces to the network.
With Cisco IOx, developers can create a wide variety of IoT apps, such as data aggregation system and control systems.
New Features in Release 1.6.0
This release provide new features, including the following:
Ability to Upload Files to Apps from Fog Director
Flash Corruption Warning
Fog Director UI Enhancements
–Disk usage warning alerts on Fog Director
–Audit listing of user actions on the device details page
–App signature verification in Fog Director
Docker Commands—Support for USER, WORKDIR, and CMD.
IOx Services
Cisco provides micro services, which are a set of pre-built protocol handlers that help provide data acquisition capabilities from various devices into the IOx Services ecosystem. Applications can be built for these services to do edge computing and to send data to the cloud.
These micro services
are built using the IOx Services SDK (only supported on IR8xx platforms).
provide RESTful APIs to configure the service.
can access normalized data from the configured device through REST and Web Socket URIs provided by the north bound interface (NBI) gateway.
The following services are supported:
IOx Modbus
IOx DNP3
IOx GPS
IOx Motion
Supported Platforms
Cisco IOx Release 1.6.0 is supported on the following platforms:
  IR809
IR829
IE4000
Utility—Pluggable CGR compute module for CGR1120 and CGR1240
Note: If you have a new production IR809 or IR829, ensure you reboot the system after adding the basic IOx configurations.
Image Information
Note: Before attempting a bundle image installation, stop the guest operating system by using following command on IOS:
guest-os 1 stop
Download the Cisco IOx images from the following DevNet page:

Upgrading Cisco Fog Director
You can upgrade Cisco Fog Director Release 1.5 to Cisco Fog Director Release 1.6. When you do so, your current Cisco Fog Director data is migrated to the new release.
Procedure
1. In the existing Fog Director 1.5 (from which you want to migrate to 1.5), navigate to the Settings tab.
2. Click Backup.
3. Provide a password with which the backup file will be encrypted. A backup file is generated.
4. Copy the backup file to your PC.
You can place the backup file in any location on the client PC and give it any name.
5. From a client PC, take these actions to obtain the VM OVA image for Cisco Fog Director 1.6:
a. Go to the following URL, and click the IOx Fog Director Software link in the Select a Software Type box:
https://software.cisco.com/download/type.html?mdfid=286290097&catid=null
b. Click the Download button that corresponds to the.ova file that you want.
c. Follow the on-screen instructions to download the file to your local drive.
6. Use the VM OVA image that you downloaded to deploy a VM for Cisco Fog Director 1.6.
7. Take these actions to update Cisco Fog Director 1.6 with the information in the backup file that you created:
a. Start and log in to Cisco Fog Director Release 1.6.
b. Click the Settings tab, and then click the Settings sub-tab.
The Settings page displays.
c. In the Backup & Restore area on the Settings page, click the RESTORE button.
The Restore dialog box displays.
d. In the Decryption password field in the Restore dialog box, enter the passphrase that you created for the backup file.
e. Click SELECT BACKUP ARCHIVE in the Restore dialog box, and then navigate to and select the backup file that you downloaded to the client PC.
The system updates Cisco Fog Director 1.6 with the information in the backup file. This process can take some time, depending on how much data is in the backup file.
When the upgrade completes, the Cisco Fog Director 1.6 Log In page displays.
In Release 1.6 of Fog Director, there are a few IOx Services that are pre-packaged with Fog Director. When you upgrade from 1.5 to 1.6 using the above procedure, these pre-packaged services will no longer be present in the upgraded Fog Director.
To restore these pre-packaged services:
1. Go to the /opt/cisco/iox_services directory in the Fog Director 1.6 VM where the pre-packaged services are presented as tar files.
2. Copy these tar files to your computer.
3. Log in to the upgraded Fog Director, and click the Apps tab.
4. Complete the following tasks for each tar file that you copied in Step 1:
a. Click on Add New App, choose Upload from my computer, and select the tar file.
b. After the file finishes uploading, click Publish.
Limitations and Restrictions
For Docker styled apps, client ID configuration on IOS must be changed to the dhclient format if migrated from IOx 1.3.0 to any later versions. Without changing this format, the Docker app does not get an IP address in bridge networking mode after the migration.
Uploading and installing an app that requires more than one serial device is not supported. This restriction applies only to FD.
If the IOx Core service bundle is corrupted and does not get into the RUNNING state, the bundle’s dependent services and apps also will not get into the RUNNING state. To resolve this issue, reactivate the dependent services.
To reflect the latest status of the IOx Core services container on the FD GUI, perform a device refresh. For example, if you install the GPS service, the core service automatically gets started. However, the status will not be reflected on FD GUI unless you refresh the device.
If you perform an FD Backup and Restore from FD 1.4.0 to FD 1.5.0, all of the prepackaged apps (IOx Core and IOx GPS) will be cleared and not available.
If CAF crashes abruptly, CAF comes back up with limited functionality. If app management services are down you can download the tech support logs and verify the reason from the CAF logs or in syslog files. An example for app management going down is a CAF abrupt crash.
The workaround is to reboot the device. If the app management services are down after the device reboots, collect the tech support logs from the device before contacting the support team.
App asking for multiple USB ports and devices is not supported. This restriction applies only to FD.
USB device hot swap-out and swap-in are not supported. You must plug in the USB device before installation the application on the IOx device.
Editing or stopping of service packages should be done only after uninstalling the dependent app.
During a device upgrade from 1.5.0 to 1.6.0 with services packages being used, the IOx core retains the 1.5.0 version. If you require the 1.6.0 version of the IOx core, uninstall the 1.5.0 version and its dependent services. Then, restart the device.
