Enhancements Common to all IoT Switches
Factory-installed trust code
For new hardware and software orders, a trust code is now installed at the time of manufacturing.

Note
You cannot use a factory-installed trust code to communicate with CSSM.
Support for trust code in additional topologies
A trust code is automatically obtained in topologies where the product instance initiates the sending of data to Cisco Smart License Utility (CSLU) and in topologies where the product instance is in an air-gapped network.
If a trust code is not available on the product instance, the product instance detects and automatically includes a request for one, as part of the RUM report. The ACK from CSSM includes the trust code.
Ability to save authorization code request and return in a file and simpler upload in the CSSM WebUI
If a product instance is in an air-gapped network, you can now save a SLAC request in a file on the product instance by configuring the license smart authorization request {add|replace} feature_name {all|local} , followed by the license smart authorization request save [path] commands.
The SLAC request file must be uploaded to the CSSM Web UI. You can then download the file containing the SLAC code and install it on the product instance. You can also upload a return request file in a similar manner. With this new method you do not have to gather and enter the required details on the CSSM Web UI to generate a SLAC. You also do not have to locate the product instance in the CSSM Web UI to return an authorization code.
In the CSSM Web UI, you must upload the SLAC request or return file in the same way as you upload a RUM report. In the required Smart Account, navigate to Reports → Usage Data Files .
RUM Report optimization and availability of statistics
RUM report generation and related processes have been optimized. This includes a reduction in the time it takes to process RUM reports, better memory and disk space utilization, and visibility into the RUM reports on the product instance (how many there are, the processing state each one is in, if there are errors in any of them, and so on).
The new show license rum privileged EXEC command displays information about Resource Utilization Measurement reports (RUM report) available on the product instance, including report IDs, the current processing state of a report, error information (if any), and to save the detailed or summarized view that is displayed.
The output of the show license tech and show license all commands were enhanced to display RUM report information.
Support to collect software version in a RUM report
If version privacy is disabled (no license smart privacy version global configuration command), the Cisco IOS-XE software version running on the product instance and the Smart Agent version is included in the RUM report.
Account information included in the ACK and show command outputs
A RUM report acknowledgement (ACK) includes the Smart Account and Virtual Account that was reported to, in CSSM. Once the ACK is installed on the product instance, you can display account information in the show license summary, show license status, show license all and show license tech commands. The account information that is displayed is always as per the latest available ACK on the product instance.
CSLU support for Linux
CSLU can now be deployed on a machine (laptop or desktop) running Linux.

Important Notes
IE3400: Hardware Changes may Require Action
Some hardware components on the Cisco Catalyst IE3400 Rugged Series and Cisco Catalyst IE3400 Heavy Duty Series switches have changed. The changes, which are automatically handled by the IOS-XE software, do not affect switch functionality or the ordering process.
However, you may need to upgrade the software, depending on which base switch and expansion module you have, as shown in the following table.

Note
For detailed information about affected hardware versions, supported software releases, and instructions for different scenarios, see FN72400 - New Hardware Versions of Cisco Catalyst IE3400 Rugged/IE3400H Heavy Duty Series Will Be Supported with Minimum Software Release - Software Upgrade Recommended on Cisco.com.
If you have...
Then...
Older versions of the base switch and expansion module
No action is required.
Newer versions of the base switch and expansion module
Deploy one of the supported releases of IOS-XE. Otherwise, you see an error message telling you that the release that you are using is not supported.
Newer version of the base switch with an older version of the expansion module
Older version of the base switch with a newer version of the expansion module
Deploy one of the supported releases of IOS-XE. Refer to Field Notice Title on Cisco.com for details that are appropriate to your deployment.
Accessing Hidden Commands
Hidden commands have always been present in Cisco IOS XE, but were not equipped with CLI help. This means that entering enter a question mark (?) at the system prompt did not display the list of available commands. Such hidden commands are only meant to assist Cisco TAC in advanced troubleshooting and are therefore not documented. For more information about CLI help, see the Using the Command-Line Interface → Understanding the Help System chapter of the Command Reference document.
This section provides information about hidden commands in Cisco IOS XE and the security measures in place, when they are accessed. Hidden commands are meant to assist Cisco TAC in advanced troubleshooting and are therefore not documented. For more information about CLI help, see the Using the Command-Line Interface → Understanding the Help System chapter of the Command Reference document.
Hidden commands are available under:
Category 1: Hidden commands in privileged or User EXEC mode. Begin by entering the service internal command to access these commands.
Category 2: Hidden commands in one of the configuration modes (global, interface and so on). These commands do not require the service internal command.
Further, the following applies to hidden commands under Category 1 and 2:
The commands have CLI help. Entering enter a question mark (?) at the system prompt displays the list of available commands.

Note
For Category 1, enter the service internal command before you enter the question mark; you do not have to do this for Category 2.
The system generates a %PARSER-5-HIDDEN syslog message when the command is used. For example:
*Feb 14 10:44:37.917: %PARSER-5-HIDDEN: Warning!!! 'show processes memory old-header ' is a hidden command. 
Use of this command is not recommended/supported and will be removed in future.
Apart from category 1 and 2, there remain internal commands displayed on the CLI, for which the system does NOT generate the %PARSER-5-HIDDEN syslog message.

Important
We recommend that you use any hidden command only under TAC supervision. If you find that you are using a hidden command, open a TAC case for help with finding another way of collecting the same information as the hidden command (for a hidden EXEC mode command), or to configure the same functionality (for a hidden configuration mode command) using non-hidden commands.
PoE Limitation on IE3x00
Even when using power supplies that can provide up to a supported maximum (for example, 170W, 240W, or 480W) for the PoE budget, the PoE budget for the IE3x00 defaults to 125W regardless of the power supplies used. You can configure the power budget to use the maximum.

Note
Before changing the power budget, the minimum power requirements for the switch need to be considered as well. Please refer to the datasheet for your switch for more details.
To use the power supply's maximum supported wattage for the PoE budget, configure the power supply max wattage in global configuration mode as follows:
Verify the maximum amount that the power supplies support for the PoE budget.
Enter power inline max max-wattage to increase the PoE budget based on the power supplies used.
max-wattage is the maximum available PoE power.
IE3300 with 10Mbps speed in Half-Duplex Mode
CRC errors were observed on the IE3300 platform when the switch is configured with 10Mbps speed in half-duplex mode.
As a workaround, configure no ptp enable on the half-duplex interface. This improves ingress and egress latencies considerably and ensures that there are no late collisions (and therefore, no CRC errors).
The issue and workaround apply to Cisco IOS XE releases 17.3.5 and greater.

Upgrading the Switch Software
This section covers the various aspects of upgrading or downgrading the device software.
Finding the Software Version
The package files for the Cisco IOS XE software can be found on the system board flash device flash (flash:) or external SDFlash (sdflash:).
You can use the show version privileged EXEC command to see the software version that is running on your switch.

Note
Although the show version output always shows the software image running on the switch, the model name shown at the end of this display is the factory configuration and does not change if you upgrade the software license.
You can also use the dir filesystem: privileged EXEC command to see the directory names of other software images that you might have stored in flash memory.
Software Images 17.7.x
The following table provides the filenames for the IOS XE 17.7.x software image for Cisco Catalyst IE3x00 Rugged, IE3400 Heavy Duty, and ESS3300 Series Switches.

Automatic Boot Loader Upgrade
When you upgrade from the existing release on your switch to a later or newer release for the first time, the boot loader may be automatically upgraded, based on the hardware version of the switch. If the boot loader is automatically upgraded, it will take effect on the next reload.
For subsequent Cisco IOS XE releases, if there is a new bootloader in that release, it may be automatically upgraded based on the hardware version of the switch when you boot up your switch with the new image for the first time.

Caution
Do not power cycle your switch during the upgrade.
Scenario

Licensing
This section provides information about the licensing packages for features available on Cisco Catalyst IE9300 Rugged Series Switches.
License Types
The following license types are available:
Permanent: for a license level, and without an expiration date.
Evaluation: a license that is not registered.

Note
Evaluation licenses are only used in Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.1. Starting with Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.2, Evaluation licenses are no longer used by Smart Licensing.
Term: a time-based license for a three, five, or seven year period.
License Levels - Usage Guidelines
Base licenses (Network-Advantage) are ordered and fulfilled only with a permanent license type.
Add-on licenses (DNA Advantage) are ordered and fulfilled only with a term license type.
An add-on license level is included when you choose a network license level. If you use DNA features, renew the license before term expiry, to continue using it, or deactivate the add-on license and then reload the switch to continue operating with the base license capabilities.
Evaluation licenses cannot be ordered. They are not tracked via Cisco Smart Software Manager and expire after a 90-day period. Evaluation licenses can be used only once on the switch and cannot be regenerated. Warning system messages about an evaluation license expiry are generated only 275 days after expiration and every week thereafter. An expired evaluation license cannot be reactivated after reload.

Note
Evaluation licenses are only used in Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.1. Starting with Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.2, Evaluation licenses are no longer used by Smart Licensing.
Network Essentials license is the default license. It is permanent. A connection to the Smart Licensing server is not required if the IE switch will be deployed with a Network Essentials license.
Smart Licensing
Cisco Smart Licensing is a unified license management system that manages all the software licenses across Cisco products.
It enables you to purchase, deploy, manage, track, and renew Cisco Software. It provides information about license ownership and consumption through a single user interface.
The solution is composed of Smart Accounts and Cisco Smart Software Manager. The former is an online account of your Cisco software assets and is required to use the latter. Cisco Smart Software Manager is where you can perform all your licensing management-related tasks such as establishing trust, checking license usage, transferring licenses, removing devices, and so forth. Users can be added and given access and permissions to the smart account and specific virtual accounts.

Important
Cisco Smart Licensing is the default and the only available method to manage licenses on IE3x00 products.
Deploying Smart Licensing
The following provides a process overview of a day 0 to day N deployment directly initiated from a device. Links to the configuration guide provide detailed information to help you complete each one of the smaller tasks.
Procedure
Step 1
Begin by establishing a connection from your network to Cisco Smart Software Manager on cisco.com.
Step 2
Create and activate your Smart Account, or login if you already have one.
To create and activate Smart Account, go to Cisco Software Central → Create Smart Accounts. Only authorized users can activate the Smart Account.
Step 3
Complete the Cisco Smart Software Manager set up.
Accept the Smart Software Licensing Agreement.
Set up the required number of Virtual Accounts, users and access rights for the virtual account users.
Virtual accounts help you organize licenses by business unit, product type, IT group, and so on.
With this,
The device is now in an authorized state and ready to use.
The licenses that you have purchased are displayed in your Smart Account.
What to do next
Register and convert traditional licenses to Smart Licenses.
Using Smart Licensing on an Out-of-the-Box Device
If an out-of-the-box device has the software version factory-provisioned, all licenses on such a device remain in evaluation mode until registered in Cisco Smart Software Manager.
How Upgrading or Downgrading Software Affects Smart Licensing
Note how upgrading to a release that supports Smart Licensing or moving to a release that does not support Smart Licensing affects licenses on a device:
When you upgrade from an earlier release to one that supports Smart Licensing—all existing licenses remain in evaluation mode until registered in Cisco Smart Software Manager. After registration, they are made available in your Smart Account.
When you downgrade to a release where Smart Licensing is not supported—all smart licenses on the device are converted to traditional licenses and all smart licensing information on the device is removed.
Smart Licensing Using Policy
An enhanced version of Smart Licensing is available, with the overarching objective of providing a licensing solution that does not interrupt the operations of your network, rather, one that enables a compliance relationship to account for the hardware and software licenses you purchase and use.
With this licensing model, you do not have to complete any licensing-specific operations, such as registering or generating keys before you start using the software and the licenses that are tied to it. Only export-controlled and enforced licenses require Cisco authorization before use. License usage is recorded on your device with timestamps, and the required workflows can be completed at a later date.
Multiple options are available for license usage reporting – this depends on the topology you implement. You can use the Cisco Smart Licensing Utility (CSLU) Windows application, or report usage information directly to Cisco Smart Software Manager (CSSM). A provision for offline reporting for air-gapped networks, where you download usage information and upload to CSSM, is also available.
Starting with this release, Smart Licensing Using Policy is automatically enabled on the device. This is also the case when you upgrade to this release.
By default, your Smart Account and Virtual Account in CSSM is enabled for Smart Licensing Using Policy.

Note
Starting with Cisco IOS XE Amsterdam 17.3.2, with the introduction of Smart Licensing Using Policy, even if you configure a hostname for a product instance or device, only the Unique Device Identifier (UDI) is displayed.
This change in the display can be observed in all licensing utilities and user interfaces where the hostname was displayed in earlier releases. It does not affect any licensing functionality. There is no workaround for this limitation.
The licensing utilities and user interfaces that are affected by this limitation include only the following: Cisco Smart Software Manager (CSSM), Cisco Smart License Utility (CSLU), and Smart Software Manager On-Prem (SSM On-Prem).
Known Issues
This section contains information about the known issues in this release.
IGMP Snooping and Unregistered Multicast Packet Forwarding
Symptoms: Although the mrouter port is configured and multicast receivers have sent igmp-joins to listen to registered multicast streams, unknown multicast streams that ingress the switch are forwarded to all the ports. The flooding may lead to reduction in bandwidth for registered multicast traffic.
Conditions: The issue occurs when the switch receives unregistered multicast packets with a pure L2 configuration and an external IGMP snooping querier is configured on the VLAN. There should not be a membership join received on any VLAN ports.
Workaround: To stop flooding on unwanted ports in the VLAN, execute the command switchport block multicast on that interface, as shown in the following example:
