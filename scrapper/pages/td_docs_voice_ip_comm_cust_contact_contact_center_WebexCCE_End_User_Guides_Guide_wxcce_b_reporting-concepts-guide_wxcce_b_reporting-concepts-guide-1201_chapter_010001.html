Trunks and Trunk Groups
Trunks and Trunk Groups
Every peripheral has one or more associated trunk groups, with each trunk group containing one, or more physical trunks.
You configure trunks and trunk groups with the Configuration Manager.

Note
Not all ACDs support trunk configuration. If your ACD does, make sure that the PG is accurately configured in Configuration Manager. For the ICM software to properly monitor ACD calls, all individual trunks and their corresponding trunk group assignments must be configured in the ICM database.
You can report on data such as the number of trunks in service, number of trunks idle, and the time during which all trunks in a trunk group were simultaneously busy (All Trunks Busy).
The following report contains operational information on trunk groups:
