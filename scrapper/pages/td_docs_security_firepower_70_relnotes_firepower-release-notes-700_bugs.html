Important
Bug lists are auto-generated once and may not be subsequently updated. If updated, the 'table last updated' date does not mean that the list was fully accurate on that date—only that some change was made. Depending on how and when a bug was categorized or updated in our system, it may not appear in the release notes. We also do not list open bugs for maintenance releases or patches. If you have a support contract, you can obtain up-to-date bug lists with the Cisco Bug Search Tool.
