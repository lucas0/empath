Product Overview
Cisco® FindIT Network Manager is a network management tool for deploying and maintaining Cisco 100 to 500 Series switches, routers, and wireless access points. FindIT Network Manager allows you to quickly discover the topology of a new network, generate a detailed inventory of the installed equipment, make changes where necessary, set up monitoring of the network, and be alerted automatically about critical events. With features such as automatic firmware updates and reporting on lifecycle and maintenance information, FindIT Network Manager helps ensure that your network remains up to date and fully supported.
FindIT Network Manager comprises two components – the Probe application, which is installed at each site and discovers and directly manages the network devices at that site; and the Manager, which provides a summary view and alerts for each site in the network.
Figure 1 and Figure 2 show different views of the application at work, while Figure 3 shows a typical deployment of FindIT Network Manager.

Ordering Information
Cisco FindIT Network Manager is licensed based on the number of network devices being managed. Licenses are only required for the Cisco 100 to 500 series products in the network, and include FindIT device licenses, required for using FindIT Network Manager, and integration licenses, required when FindIT Network Manager is being used with third-party applications such as Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) tools.
