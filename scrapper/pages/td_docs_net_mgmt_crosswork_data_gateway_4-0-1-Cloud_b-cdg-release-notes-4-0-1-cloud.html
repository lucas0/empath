Product Overview
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway is a model-driven scalable data collection platform that enables real-time data collection from multi-protocol capable devices, thereby reducing the need for multiple collection points for multiple applications requiring data from the network.
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway offers central visibility into services collecting data and the type of data being collected.
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway is not a standalone product and is expected to be used with Crosswork Cloud applications. There is no separate software license needed for Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway.
Release Details
Cisco releases updated builds of Crosswork Data Gateway on the Cisco Support & Software Download site.
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway can be installed into a data center using any of the platforms listed in the following table. The file used for deployment is unique to each of these environments.

Cisco Crosswork Cloud Traffic Analysis service is a hosted application that provides rich analysis, visualization, and optimization recommendations for network traffic flows.
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway must be deployed using the Crosswork Cloud profile for use with Crosswork Cloud applications. For information on deployment, see Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway 4.0.1 Installation and Configuration Guide for Cloud Applications.
Table shows software requirements for the supported virtualization platforms along with the physical and network resource requirements needed to support the Crosswork Data Gateway.
The resource requirements to install Crosswork Data Gateway are independent of the virtualization platform.

Management Traffic
Control/Data Traffic
Device Access Traffic
Management traffic: for accessing the Interactive Console and troubleshooting the Crosswork Data Gateway VM.
Control/Data traffic: to receive configuration of collection jobs from the Crosswork Cloud and to forward collected data to the Crosswork Cloud.
Device access traffic: for device management and telemetry data.
IP Addresses
One, two or three IPv4/IPv6 addresses based on the number of interfaces you choose to use.
Note 
Crosswork does not support dual stack configurations. Therefore, ALL addresses for the environment must be either IPv4 or IPv6.
NTP Servers
The IPv4/IPv6 addresses or host names of the NTP servers you plan to use. If you want to enter multiple NTP servers, separate them with spaces. These should be the same NTP servers you use to synchronize devices, clients, and servers across your network.
Note 
Confirm that the NTP server IP address or host name is reachable on the network or installation will fail.
The Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway host and virtual machine must be synchronized to an NTP server or the enrollment with Crosswork Cloud may not go through.
DNS Servers
The IPv4/IPv6 addresses of the DNS servers you plan to use. If you want to enter multiple DNS servers, separate them with spaces. These should be the same DNS servers you use to resolve host names across your network.
DNS Search Domain
The search domain you want to use with the DNS servers (for example, cisco.com). You can only have one search domain.
(optional) Proxy Server
URL of an optional management network proxy server.
If your environment requires an HTTP or HTTPS proxy in order to access URLs on the public Internet, you must configure a proxy server in order for the Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway to successfully connect to the Crosswork Cloud service.
