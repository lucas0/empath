Information About Snapshots
The Cisco SD-WAN cloud-hosted service includes taking regular snapshots of the Cisco vManage instances.
On-Demand Snapshots
For any major planned change window for your Cisco vManage software, you can take an on-demand snapshot of Cisco vManage. You need to freeze the configuration changes and allocate up to 8 hours before the change window to allow the on-demand snapshot to be taken and completed.
Starting April 2023, you trigger an on-demand snapshot from the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal. See Take an On-Demand Snapshot.
Daily Snapshots
These snapshots are taken automatically each night, around midnight, based on the location of the specified Cisco vManage region. Daily snapshots are taken in accordance with the frequency chosen when creating an overlay network. The snapshot frequency is set by default to once every day, typically midnight of the region of deployment, and the last ten snapshots are retained. You can retain only a maximum of the last ten periodic snapshots. Older snapshots beyond the set frequency are automatically discarded daily.
Configure the snapshot frequency as part of the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal overlay creation process by clicking Advanced Options > Edit and then by clicking Snapshot Settings.
For more information, see Create a Cisco SD-WAN Cloud-Hosted Overlay Network.
You can configure only the frequency of Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal snapshots.
You can view the snapshot details for your overlays by clicking on the name of the overlay for which a snapshot has been created.
For more information, see View Snapshots.

Note
The Cisco vSmart Controller and the Cisco vBond Orchestrator are stateless and therefore snapshots are not taken. Use a Cisco vManage template to configure and save the Cisco vBond Orchestrator and Cisco vSmart Controller settings.

Note
You cannot download the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal snapshots, as the snapshots are stored within the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal cloud account. The Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal snapshot details are provided for read-only purposes. The Cisco CloudOps team uses the snapshots for disaster recovery.
Golden Snapshots
Marking an existing daily snapshot or an on-demand snapshot as golden prevents it from getting automatically removed. We can store up to one golden snapshot. If a new daily snapshot or an on-demand snapshot is marked golden, then the golden tag is automatically removed from a previous snapshot, and that old snapshot may be subject to removal, as per the snapshot type expiration process.
You should mark a snapshot as golden, if the state of Cisco vManage is thought to be in the ideal state at the snapshot time and could serve as a good recovery point later.
Take an On-Demand Snapshot
You can take an on-demand snapshot of Cisco vManage configuration when needed. In general, take a snapshot before any major change window.
When you take an on-demand snapshot, freeze configuration changes and allocate up to 8 hours before the change window to allow the snapshot to be completed.
An on-demand snapshot is stored for 3 months from the date of its creation, then it is deleted automatically. A new on-demand snapshot replaces a stored existing one, so only one on-demand snapshot is stored at a time.

Note
On-demand snapshots are not available for shared tenants.
From the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal, navigate to the list of available overlays.
The Dashboard > Overlays page appears.
Click the name of the overlay for which you want to take a snapshot.
From the Dashboard > Cisco Hosted Overlays > Details page, click the Snapshot tile.
From the Actions drop-down menu, choose On-Demand Snapshot.
In the On-Demand Snapshot area, turn on the switch for the Cisco vManage instance for which you want to take the snapshot.
For a Cisco vManage cluster, turn on the switches for each Cisco vManage instance in the cluster.
Click Submit.
The snapshot is created. The creation process can take up 8 hours to complete, depending on the amount of data in Cisco vManage.
Delete an Overlay Network
To delete an overlay network, contact Cisco SD-WAN Technical Support. You cannot delete an overlay network.
Specify the Allowed List of IP Addresses for Managing Controller Access
For Cisco-hosted overlay networks, you can specify trusted IP addresses, including prefixes, from which you can manage controller access. To enable management access, specify a rule type, protocol, port range, and source IP (IP addresses and prefixes) for which you require access.

Note
You do not need to add the IP addresses of WAN edge devices for them to join the overlay. Devices with any IP address can join the overlay, using Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) tunnels, as long as Cisco vManage allows the device serial numbers.
You can add up to 200 rules per overlay.
Each rule is uniformly applied to all cloud-hosted controllers within the overlay.
The same rules are automatically applied when new cloud-hosted instances are added, or existing instances are replaced. The rule can be either a single IP address or a larger IP prefix.
From the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal dashboard, navigate to your overlay network.
From the drop-down list, click Cisco Hosted Overlays.
The list of overlay networks appears.
Click the name of your overlay network.
Click Inbound Rules.
Specify the following parameters for your IP address or prefix:
Rule type: Choose one of the following: All, SSH, HTTPS, Custom TCP rule, or Custom UDP rule.
Port range: For custom TCP and UDP rules, specify a port range.
Source: Specify an IP address or IP address prefix.
Press Enter to add the source IP address or IP address prefix.
Click Add.
(Optional) Add any additional IP addresses or IP address prefixes that you want to allow.
Click Save.

Release Information
Description
Predefined Inbound Rules
March 2023 Release
With this feature you can specify trusted IP addresses. These IP addresses are applied to any new overlay that you create under the Smart Account for which you configure this feature. These IP addresses can also be applied to existing overlays under the Smart Account for which you configure this feature.
Information About Predefined Inbound Rules
With this feature you can create inbound rules, each of which specifies trusted IP addresses. These IP addresses are applied to any new overlay that you create under the Smart Account for which you configure this feature. These IP addresses can also be applied to existing overlays under the Smart Account for which you configure this feature.
An inbound rule includes the rule name, protocol and port range to which the rule applies, and source IP address or prefix information. You can create up to 200 inbound rules.
Use Cases for Predefined Inbound Rules
Predefined inbound rules provide a convenient way to add the same group of trusted IP addresses to existing and new overlays. By creating predefined inbound rules, you avoid having to configure trusted IP address for each overlay manually.
Configure Predefined Inbound Rules
From the Cisco SD-WAN Portal menu, choose Admin Settings.
Click … adjacent to the Smart Account for which you want to configure a predefined inbound rule and click Manage Predefined Inbound Rules.
A list of the inbound rules that have been configured appears.
