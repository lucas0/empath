Chapter: Threat Defense Deployment with a Remote Management Center
Chapter Contents
Is This Chapter for You?
To see all available operating systems and managers, see Which Operating System and Manager is Right for You?. This chapter applies to the threat defense at a remote branch office using the management center at a central headquarters.
Each threat defense controls, inspects, monitors, and analyzes traffic, and then reports to a managing management center. The management center provides a centralized management console with a web interface that you can use to perform administrative, management, analysis, and reporting tasks in service to securing your local network.
An administrator at the central headquarters pre-configures the threat defense at the CLI or using the device manager, and then sends the threat defense to the remote branch office.
The branch office administrator cables and powers on the threat defense.
The central administrator completes configuration of the threat defense using the management center.

Note
Remote branch deployment requires version 6.7 or later.
About the Firewall
The hardware can run either threat defense software or ASA software. Switching between threat defense and ASA requires you to reimage the device. You should also reimage if you need a different software version than is currently installed. See Reimage the Cisco ASA or Firepower Threat Defense Device.
The firewall runs an underlying operating system called the Secure Firewall eXtensible Operating System (FXOS). The firewall does not support the FXOS Secure Firewall chassis manager; only a limited CLI is supported for troubleshooting purposes. See the Cisco FXOS Troubleshooting Guide for the Firepower 1000/2100 and Secure Firewall 3100 with Firepower Threat Defense for more information.
Privacy Collection Statement—The firewall does not require or actively collect personally identifiable information. However, you can use personally identifiable information in the configuration, for example for usernames. In this case, an administrator might be able to see this information when working with the configuration or when using SNMP.

How Remote Management Works
To allow the management center to manage the threat defense over the internet, you use the outside interface for management center management instead of the Management interface. Because most remote branch offices only have a single internet connection, outside management center access makes centralized management possible.

Note
You can use any data interface for manager access, for example, the inside interface if you have an inside management center. However, this guide primarily covers outside interface access, because it is the most likely scenario for remote branch offices.
The Management interface is a special interface configured separately from the threat defense data interfaces, and it has its own network settings. The Management interface network settings are still used even though you are enabling manager access on a data interface. All management traffic continues to be sourced from or destined to the Management interface. When you enable manager access on a data interface, the threat defense forwards incoming management traffic over the backplane to the Management interface. For outgoing management traffic, the Management interface forwards the traffic over the backplane to the data interface.
Manager access from a data interface has the following limitations:
You can only enable manager access on a physical, data interface. You cannot use a subinterface or EtherChannel. You can also enable manager access on a single secondary interface in the management center for redundancy.
This interface cannot be management-only.
Routed firewall mode only, using a routed interface.
PPPoE is not supported. If your ISP requires PPPoE, you will have to put a router with PPPoE support between the threat defense and the WAN modem.
The interface must be in the global VRF only.
SSH is not enabled by default for data interfaces, so you will have to enable SSH later using the management center. Because the Management interface gateway will be changed to be the data interfaces, you also cannot SSH to the Management interface from a remote network unless you add a static route for the Management interface using the configure network static-routes command.
High Availability is not supported. You must use the Management interface in this case.
The following figure shows the management center at central headquarters and the threat defense with the manager access on the outside interface.
Either the threat defense or management center needs a public IP address or hostname to allow to allow the inbound management connection; you need to know this IP address for initial setup. You can also optionally configure Dynamic DNS (DDNS) for the outside interface to accommodate changing DHCP IP assignments.
Figure 1.
Before You Start
Deploy and perform initial configuration of the management center. See the Cisco Firepower Management Center 1600, 2600, and 4600 Hardware Installation Guide or Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center Virtual Getting Started Guide.

(Optional) Check the Software and Install a New Version
To check the software version and, if necessary, install a different version, perform these steps. We recommend that you install your target version before you configure the firewall. Alternatively, you can perform an upgrade after you are up and running, but upgrading, which preserves your configuration, may take longer than using this procedure.
What Version Should I Run?
Cisco recommends running a Gold Star release indicated by a gold star next to the release number on the software download page. You can also refer to the release strategy described in https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/firewalls/bulletin-c25-743178.html; for example, this bulletin describes short-term release numbering (with the latest features), long-term release numbering (maintenance releases and patches for a longer period of time), or extra long-term release numbering (maintenance releases and patches for the longest period of time, for government certification).
Procedure
Step 1
Connect to the CLI. See Access the Threat Defense and FXOS CLI for more information. This procedure shows using the console port, but you can use SSH instead.
Log in with the admin user and the default password, Admin123.
You connect to the FXOS CLI. The first time you log in, you are prompted to change the password. This password is also used for the threat defense login for SSH.
Note 
If the password was already changed, and you do not know it, you must perform a factory reset to reset the password to the default. See the FXOS troubleshooting guide for the factory reset procedure.
Example:
firepower login: admin
Password: Admin123
Successful login attempts for user 'admin' : 1

[...]

Hello admin. You must change your password.
Enter new password: ********
Confirm new password: ********
Your password was updated successfully.

[...]

Step 2
At the FXOS CLI, show the running version.
scope ssa
show app-instance
Example:
Firepower# scope ssa
Firepower /ssa # show app-instance

Step 3
If you want to install a new version, perform these steps.
If you need to set a static IP address for the Management interface, see Complete the Threat Defense Initial Configuration Using the CLI. By default, the Management interface uses DHCP.
You will need to download the new image from a server accessible from the Management interface.
Perform the reimage procedure in the FXOS troubleshooting guide.
Pre-Configuration Using the Device Manager
Connect to the device manager to perform initial setup of the threat defense. When you perform initial setup using the device manager, all interface configuration completed in the device manager is retained when you switch to the management center for management, in addition to the Management interface and manager access settings. Note that other default configuration settings, such as the access control policy or security zones, are not retained. When you use the CLI, only the Management interface and manager access settings are retained (for example, the default inside interface configuration is not retained).
Before you begin
Deploy and perform initial configuration of the management center. See the Cisco Firepower Management Center 1600, 2600, and 4600 Hardware Installation Guide. You will need to know the management center IP address or hostname before you set up the threat defense.
Use a current version of Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Edge, or Internet Explorer.
Procedure
Step 1
Connect your management computer to the Inside (Ethernet 1/2) interface.
Step 2
Power on the firewall.
Note 
The first time you boot up the threat defense, initialization can take approximately 15 to 30 minutes.
Step 3
Log in to the device manager.
Enter the following URL in your browser: https://192.168.95.1
Log in with the username admin, and the default password Admin123.
You are prompted to read and accept the End User License Agreement and change the admin password.
Step 4
Use the setup wizard when you first log into the device manager to complete the initial configuration. You can optionally skip the setup wizard by clicking Skip device setup at the bottom of the page.
After you complete the setup wizard, in addition to the default configuraton for the inside interface (Ethernet1/2), you will have configuration for an outside (Ethernet1/1) interface that will be maintained when you switch to management center management.
Configure the following options for the outside and management interfaces and click Next.
Outside Interface Address—This interface is typically the internet gateway, and might be used as your manager access interface. You cannot select an alternative outside interface during initial device setup. The first data interface is the default outside interface.
If you want to use a different interface from outside (or inside) for manager access, you will have to configure it manually after completing the setup wizard.
Configure IPv4—The IPv4 address for the outside interface. You can use DHCP or manually enter a static IP address, subnet mask, and gateway. You can also select Off to not configure an IPv4 address. You cannot configure PPPoE using the setup wizard. PPPoE may be required if the interface is connected to a DSL modem, cable modem, or other connection to your ISP, and your ISP uses PPPoE to provide your IP address. You can configure PPPoE after you complete the wizard.
Configure IPv6—The IPv6 address for the outside interface. You can use DHCP or manually enter a static IP address, prefix, and gateway. You can also select Off to not configure an IPv6 address.
Management Interface
You will not see Management Interface settings if you performed intial setup at the CLI.
The Management interface settings are used even though you are enabling the manager access on a data interface. For example, the management traffic that is routed over the backplane through the data interface will resolve FQDNs using the Management interface DNS servers, and not the data interface DNS servers.
DNS Servers—The DNS server for the system's management address. Enter one or more addresses of DNS servers for name resolution. The default is the OpenDNS public DNS servers. If you edit the fields and want to return to the default, click Use OpenDNS to reload the appropriate IP addresses into the fields.
Firewall Hostname—The hostname for the system's management address.
Configure the Time Setting (NTP) and click Next.
Time Zone—Select the time zone for the system.
NTP Time Server—Select whether to use the default NTP servers or to manually enter the addresses of your NTP servers. You can add multiple servers to provide backups.
Select Start 90 day evaluation period without registration.
Do not register the threat defense with the Smart Software Manager; all licensing is performed on the management center.
Click Finish.
You are prompted to choose Cloud Management or Standalone. For management center management, choose Standalone, and then Got It.
Step 5
(Might be required) Configure the Management interface. See the Management interface on Device > Interfaces.
The Management interface must have the gateway set to data interfaces. By default, the Management interface receives an IP address and gateway from DHCP. If you do not receive a gateway from DHCP (for example, you did not connect this interface to a network), then the gateway will default to data interfaces, and you do not need to configure anything. If you did receive a gateway from DHCP, then you need to instead configure this interface with a static IP address and set the gateway to data interfaces.
Step 6
If you want to configure additional interfaces, including an interface other than outside or inside that you want to use for the manager access, choose Device, and then click the link in the Interfaces summary.
See Configure the Firewall in the Device Manager for more information about configuring interfaces in the device manager. Other device manager configuration will not be retained when you register the device to the management center.
Step 7
Choose Device > System Settings > Central Management, and click Proceed to set up the management center management.
Step 8
Configure the Management Center/CDO Details.
Figure 3. Management Center/CDO Details
For Do you know the Management Center/CDO hostname or IP address, click Yes if you can reach the management center using an IP address or hostname, or No if the management center is behind NAT or does not have a public IP address or hostname.
At least one of the devices, either the management center or the threat defense device, must have a reachable IP address to establish the two-way, SSL-encrypted communication channel between the two devices.
If you chose Yes, then enter the Management Center/CDO Hostname/IP Address.
Specify the Management Center/CDO Registration Key.
This key is a one-time registration key of your choice that you will also specify on the management center when you register the threat defense device. The registration key must not exceed 37 characters. Valid characters include alphanumerical characters (A–Z, a–z, 0–9) and the hyphen (-). This ID can be used for multiple devices registering to the management center.
Specify a NAT ID.
This ID is a unique, one-time string of your choice that you will also specify on the management center. This field is required if you only specify the IP address on one of the devices; but we recommend that you specify the NAT ID even if you know the IP addresses of both devices. The NAT ID must not exceed 37 characters. Valid characters include alphanumerical characters (A–Z, a–z, 0–9) and the hyphen (-). This ID cannot be used for any other devices registering to the management center. The NAT ID is used in combination with the IP address to verify that the connection is coming from the correct device; only after authentication of the IP address/NAT ID will the registration key be checked.
Step 9
Configure the Connectivity Configuration.
Specify the FTD Hostname.
This FQDN will be used for the outside interface, or whichever interface you choose for the Management Center/CDO Access Interface.
Specify the DNS Server Group.
Choose an existing group, or create a new one. The default DNS group is called CiscoUmbrellaDNSServerGroup, which includes the OpenDNS servers.
This setting sets the data interface DNS server. The Management DNS server that you set with the setup wizard is used for management traffic. The data DNS server is used for DDNS (if configured) or for security policies applied to this interface. You are likley to choose the same DNS server group that you used for Management, because both management and data traffic reach the DNS server through the outside interface.
On the management center, the data interface DNS servers are configured in the Platform Settings policy that you assign to this threat defense. When you add the threat defense to the management center, the local setting is maintained, and the DNS servers are not added to a Platform Settings policy. However, if you later assign a Platform Settings policy to the threat defense that includes a DNS configuration, then that configuration will overwrite the local setting. We suggest that you actively configure the DNS Platform Settings to match this setting to bring the management center and the threat defense into sync.
Also, local DNS servers are only retained by the management center if the DNS servers were discovered at initial registration.
For the Management Center/CDO Access Interface, choose outside.
You can choose any configured interface, but this guide assumes you are using outside.
Step 10
If you chose a different data interface from outside, then add a default route.
You will see a message telling you to check that you have a default route through the interface. If you chose outside, you already configured this route as part of the setup wizard. If you chose a different interface, then you need to manually configure a default route before you connect to the management center. See Configure the Firewall in the Device Manager for more information about configuring static routes in the device manager.
Step 11
Click Add a Dynamic DNS (DDNS) method.
DDNS ensures the management center can reach the threat defense at its Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) if the threat defense's IP address changes. See Device > System Settings > DDNS Service to configure DDNS.
If you configure DDNS before you add the threat defense to the management center, the threat defense automatically adds certificates for all of the major CAs from the Cisco Trusted Root CA bundle so that the threat defense can validate the DDNS server certificate for the HTTPS connection. The threat defense supports any DDNS server that uses the DynDNS Remote API specification (https://help.dyn.com/remote-access-api/).
Step 12
Click Connect. The Registration Status dialog box shows the current status of the switch to the management center. After the Saving Management Center/CDO Registration Settings step, go to the management center, and add the firewall.
If you want to cancel the switch to the management center, click Cancel Registration. Otherwise, do not close the device manager browser window until after the Saving Management Center/CDO Registration Settings step. If you do, the process will be paused, and will only resume when you reconnect to the device manager.
If you remain connected to the device manager after the Saving Management Center/CDO Registration Settings step, you will eventually see the Successful Connection with Management Center or CDO dialog box, after which you will be disconnected from the device manager.
Figure 4. Successful Connection
Pre-Configuration Using the CLI
Connect to the threat defense CLI to perform initial setup. When you use the CLI for initial configuration, only the Management interface and manager access interface settings are retained.When you perform initial setup using the device manager (7.1 and later), all interface configuration completed in the device manager is retained when you switch to the management center for management, in addition to the Management interface and manager access interface settings. Note that other default configuration settings, such as the access control policy, are not retained.
Before you begin
Deploy and perform initial configuration of the management center. See the Cisco Firepower Management Center 1600, 2600, and 4600 Hardware Installation Guide. You will need to know the management center IP address or hostname before you set up the threat defense.
Procedure
Step 1
Power on the firewall.
Note 
The first time you boot up the threat defense, initialization can take approximately 15 to 30 minutes.
Step 2
Connect to the threat defense CLI on the console port.
The console port connects to the FXOS CLI.
Step 3
Log in with the username admin and the password Admin123.
The first time you log in to the FXOS, you are prompted to change the password. This password is also used for the threat defense login for SSH.
Note 
If the password was already changed, and you do not know it, then you must reimage the device to reset the password to the default. See the FXOS troubleshooting guide for the reimage procedure.
Example:
firepower login: admin
Password: Admin123
Successful login attempts for user 'admin' : 1

[...]

Hello admin. You must change your password.
Enter new password: ********
Confirm new password: ********
Your password was updated successfully.

[...]

firepower# 
Step 4
Connect to the threat defense CLI.
connect ftd
Example:
firepower# connect ftd
>
Step 5
The first time you log in to the threat defense, you are prompted to accept the End User License Agreement (EULA) and, if using an SSH connection, to change the admin password. You are then presented with the CLI setup script for the Management interface settings.
The Management interface settings are used even though you are enabling manager access on a data interface.
Note 
You cannot repeat the CLI setup wizard unless you clear the configuration; for example, by reimaging. However, all of these settings can be changed later at the CLI using configure network commands. See Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Command Reference.
Defaults or previously entered values appear in brackets. To accept previously entered values, press Enter.
See the following guidelines:
Configure IPv4 via DHCP or manually?—Choose manual. Although you do not plan to use the Management interface, you must set an IP address, for example, a private address. You cannot configure a data interface for management if the management interface is set to DHCP, because the default route, which must be data-interfaces (see the next bullet), might be overwritten with one received from the DHCP server.
Enter the IPv4 default gateway for the management interface—Set the gateway to be data-interfaces. This setting forwards management traffic over the backplane so it can be routed through the manager access data interface.
If your networking information has changed, you will need to reconnect—If you are connected with SSH, you will be disconnected. You can reconnect with the new IP address and password if your management computer is on the management network. You will not be able to reconnect yet from a remote network due to the default route change (through the data interfaces). Console connections are not affected.
Manage the device locally?—Enter no to use the management center. A yes answer means you will use the device manager instead.
Configure firewall mode?—Enter routed. Outside manager access is only supported in routed firewall mode.
Example:
You must accept the EULA to continue.
Press <ENTER> to display the EULA:
End User License Agreement
[...]

Please enter 'YES' or press <ENTER> to AGREE to the EULA: 

System initialization in progress.  Please stand by.
You must change the password for 'admin' to continue.

Update policy deployment information
    - add device configuration
    - add network discovery
    - add system policy

You can register the sensor to a Firepower Management Center and use the
Firepower Management Center to manage it. Note that registering the sensor
to a Firepower Management Center disables on-sensor Firepower Services
management capabilities.

When registering the sensor to a Firepower Management Center, a unique
alphanumeric registration key is always required.  In most cases, to register
a sensor to a Firepower Management Center, you must provide the hostname or
the IP address along with the registration key.
'configure manager add [hostname | ip address ] [registration key ]'

However, if the sensor and the Firepower Management Center are separated by a
NAT device, you must enter a unique NAT ID, along with the unique registration
key.
'configure manager add DONTRESOLVE [registration key ] [ NAT ID ]'

Later, using the web interface on the Firepower Management Center, you must
use the same registration key and, if necessary, the same NAT ID when you add
this sensor to the Firepower Management Center.
>
Step 6
Configure the outside interface for manager access.
configure network management-data-interface
You are then prompted to configure basic network settings for the outside interface. See the following details for using this command:
The Management interface cannot use DHCP if you want to use a data interface for management. If you did not set the IP address manually during initial setup, you can set it now using the configure network {ipv4 | ipv6} manual command. If you did not already set the Management interface gateway to data-interfaces, this command will set it now.
When you add the threat defense to the management center, the management center discovers and maintains the interface configuration, including the following settings: interface name and IP address, static route to the gateway, DNS servers, and DDNS server. For more information about the DNS server configuration, see below. In the management center, you can later make changes to the manager access interface configuration, but make sure you don't make changes that can prevent the threat defense or the management center from re-establishing the management connection. If the management connection is disrupted, the threat defense includes the configure policy rollback command to restore the previous deployment.
If you configure a DDNS server update URL, the threat defense automatically adds certificates for all of the major CAs from the Cisco Trusted Root CA bundle so that the threat defense can validate the DDNS server certificate for the HTTPS connection. The threat defense supports any DDNS server that uses the DynDNS Remote API specification (https://help.dyn.com/remote-access-api/).
This command sets the data interface DNS server. The Management DNS server that you set with the setup script (or using the configure network dns servers command) is used for management traffic. The data DNS server is used for DDNS (if configured) or for security policies applied to this interface.
On the management center, the data interface DNS servers are configured in the Platform Settings policy that you assign to this threat defense. When you add the threat defense to the management center, the local setting is maintained, and the DNS servers are not added to a Platform Settings policy. However, if you later assign a Platform Settings policy to the threat defense that includes a DNS configuration, then that configuration will overwrite the local setting. We suggest that you actively configure the DNS Platform Settings to match this setting to bring the management center and the threat defense into sync.
Also, local DNS servers are only retained by the management center if the DNS servers were discovered at initial registration. For example, if you registered the device using the Management interface, but then later configure a data interface using the configure network management-data-interface command, then you must manually configure all of these settings in the management center, including the DNS servers, to match the threat defense configuration.
You can change the management interface after you register the threat defense to the management center, to either the Management interface or another data interface.
The FQDN that you set in the setup wizard will be used for this interface.
You can clear the entire device configuration as part of the command; you might use this option in a recovery scenario, but we do not suggest you use it for initial setup or normal operation.
To disable data managemement, enter the configure network management-data-interface disable command.
Example:
> configure network management-data-interface
Data interface to use for management: ethernet1/1
Specify a name for the interface [outside]:
IP address (manual / dhcp) [dhcp]:  
DDNS server update URL [none]: https://deanwinchester:pa$$w0rd17@domains.example.com/nic/update?hostname=<h>&myip=<a>
Do you wish to clear all the device configuration before applying ? (y/n) [n]:

Setting IPv4 network configuration.
Network settings changed.

>
Step 7
(Optional) Limit data interface access to the management center on a specific network.
configure network management-data-interface client ip_address netmask
By default, all networks are allowed.
Step 8
Identify the management center that will manage this threat defense.
configure manager add {hostname | IPv4_address | IPv6_address | DONTRESOLVE} reg_key [nat_id]
{hostname | IPv4_address | IPv6_address | DONTRESOLVE}—Specifies either the FQDN or IP address of the management center. If the management center is not directly addressable, use DONTRESOLVE. At least one of the devices, either the management center or the threat defense, must have a reachable IP address to establish the two-way, SSL-encrypted communication channel between the two devices. If you specify DONTRESOLVE in this command, then the threat defense must have a reachable IP address or hostname.
reg_key—Specifies a one-time registration key of your choice that you will also specify on the management center when you register the threat defense. The registration key must not exceed 37 characters. Valid characters include alphanumerical characters (A–Z, a–z, 0–9) and the hyphen (-).
nat_id—Specifies a unique, one-time string of your choice that you will also specify on the management center. When you use a data interface for management, then you must specify the NAT ID on both the threat defense and the management center for registration. The NAT ID must not exceed 37 characters. Valid characters include alphanumerical characters (A–Z, a–z, 0–9) and the hyphen (-). This ID cannot be used for any other devices registering to the management center.
Example:
> configure manager add fmc-1.example.com regk3y78 natid56
Manager successfully configured.
Step 9
Shut down the threat defense so you can send the device to the remote branch office.
It's important that you shut down your system properly. Simply unplugging the power or pressing the power switch can cause serious file system damage. Remember that there are many processes running in the background all the time, and unplugging or shutting off the power does not allow the graceful shutdown of your system.
Enter the shutdown command.
Observe the Power LED and Status LED to verify that the chassis is powered off (appear unlit).
After the chassis has successfully powered off, you can then unplug the power to physically remove power from the chassis if necessary.
Branch Office Installation
After you receive the threat defense from central headquarters, you only need to cable and power on the firewall so that it has internet access from the outside interface. The central administrator can then complete the configuration.
Cable the Firewall
Power on the Device
Cable the Firewall
The management center and your management computer reside at a remote headquarters, and can reach the threat defense over the internet. To cable the Firepower 1100, see the following steps.
Figure 5. Cabling a Remote Management Deployment
Procedure
Step 1
Install the chassis. See the hardware installation guide.
Step 2
Connect the outside interface (Ethernet 1/1) to your outside router.
Step 3
Connect the inside interface (for example, Ethernet 1/2) to your inside switch or router.
Step 4
Connect other networks to the remaining interfaces.
Step 5
(Optional) Connect the management computer to the console port.
At the branch office, the console connection is not required for everyday use; however, it may be required for troubleshooting purposes.
Power on the Device
System power is controlled by a rocker power switch located on the rear of the device. The power switch is implemented as a soft notification switch that supports graceful shutdown of the system to reduce the risk of system software and data corruption.

Note
The first time you boot up the threat defense, initialization can take approximately 15 to 30 minutes.
Before you begin
It's important that you provide reliable power for your device (for example, using an uninterruptable power supply (UPS)). Loss of power without first shutting down can cause serious file system damage. There are many processes running in the background all the time, and losing power does not allow the graceful shutdown of your firewall system.
Procedure
Step 1
Attach the power cord to the device, and connect it to an electrical outlet.
Step 2
Turn the power on using the standard rocker-type power on/off switch located on the rear of the chassis, adjacent to the power cord.
Step 3
Check the Power LED on the back of the device; if it is solid green, the device is powered on.
Step 4
Check the Status LED on the back of the device; after it is solid green, the system has passed power-on diagnostics.
Note 
When the switch is toggled from ON to OFF, it may take several seconds for the system to eventually power off. During this time, the Power LED on the front of the chassis blinks green. Do not remove the power until the Power LED is completely off.

Step 2
If you have not already done so, register the management center with the Smart Software Manager.
Registering requires you to generate a registration token in the Smart Software Manager. See the management center configuration guide for detailed instructions. For Low-Touch Provisioning, you must enable Cloud Assistance for Low-Touch Provisioning either when you register with the Smart Software Manager, or after you register. See the System > Licenses > Smart Licenses page.
Register the Threat Defense with the Management Center
Register the threat defense to the management center.
Before you begin
Gather the following information that you set in the threat defense initial configuration:
The threat defense management IP address or hostname, and NAT ID
The management center registration key
Procedure
Step 1
In the management center, choose Devices > Device Management.
Step 2
From the Add drop-down list, choose Add Device.
Set the following parameters:
Host—Enter the IP address or hostname of the threat defense you want to add. You can leave this field blank if you specified both the management center IP address and a NAT ID in the threat defense initial configuration.
Note 
In an HA environment, when both the management centers are behind a NAT, you can register the threat defense without a host IP or name in the primary management center. However, for registering the threat defense in a secondary management center, you must provide the IP address or hostname for the threat defense.
Display Name—Enter the name for the threat defense as you want it to display in the management center.
Registration Key—Enter the same registration key that you specified in the threat defense initial configuration.
Domain—Assign the device to a leaf domain if you have a multidomain environment.
Group—Assign it to a device group if you are using groups.
Access Control Policy—Choose an initial policy. Unless you already have a customized policy you know you need to use, choose Create new policy, and choose Block all traffic. You can change this later to allow traffic; see Allow Traffic from Inside to Outside.
Figure 7. New Policy
Smart Licensing—Assign the Smart Licenses you need for the features you want to deploy: Malware (if you intend to use malware inspection), Threat (if you intend to use intrusion prevention), and URL (if you intend to implement category-based URL filtering). Note: You can apply an Secure Client remote access VPN license after you add the device, from the System > Licenses > Smart Licenses page.
Unique NAT ID—Specify the NAT ID that you specified in the threat defense initial configuration.
Transfer Packets—Allow the device to transfer packets to the management center. When events like IPS or Snort are triggered with this option enabled, the device sends event metadata information and packet data to the management center for inspection. If you disable it, only event information will be sent to the management center, but packet data is not sent.
Step 3
Click Register, and confirm a successful registration.
If the registration succeeds, the device is added to the list. If it fails, you will see an error message. If the threat defense fails to register, check the following items:
Ping—Access the threat defense CLI, and ping the management center IP address using the following command:
ping system ip_address
If the ping is not successful, check your network settings using the show network command. If you need to change the threat defense Management IP address, use the configure network management-data-interface command.
Registration key, NAT ID, and management center IP address—Make sure you are using the same registration key, and if used, NAT ID, on both devices. You can set the registration key and NAT ID on the threat defense using the configure manager add command.
For more troubleshooting information, see https://cisco.com/go/fmc-reg-error.
Configure a Basic Security Policy
This section describes how to configure a basic security policy with the following settings:
Inside and outside interfaces—Assign a static IP address to the inside interface. You configured basic settings for the outside interface as part of the manager access setup, but you still need to assign it to a security zone.
DHCP server—Use a DHCP server on the inside interface for clients.
NAT—Use interface PAT on the outside interface.
Access control—Allow traffic from inside to outside.
SSH—Enable SSH on the manager access interface.
Configure Interfaces
Enable the threat defense interfaces, assign them to security zones, and set the IP addresses. Typically, you must configure at least a minimum of two interfaces to have a system that passes meaningful traffic. Normally, you would have an outside interface that faces the upstream router or internet, and one or more inside interfaces for your organization’s networks. Some of these interfaces might be “demilitarized zones” (DMZs), where you place publically-accessible assets such as your web server.
A typical edge-routing situation is to obtain the outside interface address through DHCP from your ISP, while you define static addresses on the inside interfaces.
The following example configures a routed mode inside interface with a static address and a routed mode outside interface using DHCP.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Devices > Device Management, and click the Edit () for the firewall.
Step 2
Click Interfaces.
Step 3
Click Edit () for the interface that you want to use for inside.
The General tab appears.
Enter a Name up to 48 characters in length.
For example, name the interface inside.
Check the Enabled check box.
Leave the Mode set to None.
From the Security Zone drop-down list, choose an existing inside security zone or add a new one by clicking New.
For example, add a zone called inside_zone. Each interface must be assigned to a security zone and/or interface group. An interface can belong to only one security zone, but can also belong to multiple interface groups. You apply your security policy based on zones or groups. For example, you can assign the inside interface to the inside zone; and the outside interface to the outside zone. Then you can configure your access control policy to enable traffic to go from inside to outside, but not from outside to inside. Most policies only support security zones; you can use zones or interface groups in NAT policies, prefilter policies, and QoS policies.
Click the IPv4 and/or IPv6 tab.
IPv4—Choose Use Static IP from the drop-down list, and enter an IP address and subnet mask in slash notation.
For example, enter 192.168.1.1/24
IPv6—Check the Autoconfiguration check box for stateless autoconfiguration.
Click OK.
Step 4
Click the Edit () for the interface that you want to use for outside.
The General tab appears.
You already pre-configured this interface for manager access, so the interface will already be named, enabled, and addressed. You should not alter any of these basic settings because doing so will disrupt the management center management connection. You must still configure the Security Zone on this screen for through traffic policies.
From the Security Zone drop-down list, choose an existing outside security zone or add a new one by clicking New.
For example, add a zone called outside_zone.
Click OK.
Step 5
Click Save.
Configure the DHCP Server
Enable the DHCP server if you want clients to use DHCP to obtain IP addresses from the threat defense.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Devices > Device Management, and click the Edit () for the device.
Step 2
Choose DHCP > DHCP Server.
Step 3
On the Server page, click Add, and configure the following options:
Interface—Choose the interface from the drop-down list.
Address Pool—Set the range of IP addresses from lowest to highest that are used by the DHCP server. The range of IP addresses must be on the same subnet as the selected interface and cannot include the IP address of the interface itself.
Enable DHCP Server—Enable the DHCP server on the selected interface.
Step 4
Click OK.
Step 5
Click Save.
Configure NAT
Configure NAT
A typical NAT rule converts internal addresses to a port on the outside interface IP address. This type of NAT rule is called interface Port Address Translation (PAT).
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Devices > NAT, and click New Policy > Threat Defense NAT.
Step 2
Name the policy, select the device(s) that you want to use the policy, and click Save.
The policy is added the management center. You still have to add rules to the policy.
Step 3
Click Add Rule.
The Add NAT Rule dialog box appears.
Step 4
Configure the basic rule options:
NAT Rule—Choose Auto NAT Rule.
Type—Choose Dynamic.
Step 5
On the Interface Objects page, add the outside zone from the Available Interface Objects area to the Destination Interface Objects area.
Step 6
On the Translation page, configure the following options:
Original Source—Click Add () to add a network object for all IPv4 traffic (0.0.0.0/0).
Note 
You cannot use the system-defined any-ipv4 object, because Auto NAT rules add NAT as part of the object definition, and you cannot edit system-defined objects.
Translated Source—Choose Destination Interface IP.
Step 7
Click Save to add the rule.
The rule is saved to the Rules table.
Step 8
Click Save on the NAT page to save your changes.
Allow Traffic from Inside to Outside
If you created a basic Block all traffic access control policy when you registered the threat defense, then you need to add rules to the policy to allow traffic through the device. The following procedure adds a rule to allow traffic from the inside zone to the outside zone. If you have other zones, be sure to add rules allowing traffic to the appropriate networks.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Policy > Access Policy > Access Policy, and click the Edit () for the access control policy assigned to the threat defense.
Step 2
Click Add Rule, and set the following parameters:
Name—Name this rule, for example, inside_to_outside.
Source Zones—Select the inside zone from Available Zones, and click Add to Source.
Destination Zones—Select the outside zone from Available Zones, and click Add to Destination.
Leave the other settings as is.
Step 3
Click Add.
The rule is added to the Rules table.
Step 4
Click Save.
Configure SSH on the Manager Access Data Interface
If you enabled management center access on a data interface, such as outside, you should enable SSH on that interface using this procedure. This section describes how to enable SSH connections to one or more data interfaces on the threat defense. SSH is not supported to the Diagnostic logical interface.

Note
SSH is enabled by default on the Management interface; however, this screen does not affect Management SSH access.
The Management interface is separate from the other interfaces on the device. It is used to set up and register the device to the management center. SSH for data interfaces shares the internal and external user list with SSH for the Management interface. Other settings are configured separately: for data interfaces, enable SSH and access lists using this screen; SSH traffic for data interfaces uses the regular routing configuration, and not any static routes configured at setup or at the CLI.
For the Management interface, to configure an SSH access list, see the configure ssh-access-list command in the Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Command Reference. To configure a static route, see the configure network static-routes command. By default, you configure the default route through the Management interface at initial setup.
To use SSH, you do not also need an access rule allowing the host IP address. You only need to configure SSH access according to this section.
You can only SSH to a reachable interface; if your SSH host is located on the outside interface, you can only initiate a management connection directly to the outside interface.

Note
After a user makes three consecutive failed attempts to log into the CLI via SSH, the device terminates the SSH connection.
Before you begin
You can configure SSH internal users at the CLI using the configure user add command. By default, there is an admin user for which you configured the password during initial setup. You can also configure external users on LDAP or RADIUS by configuring External Authentication in platform settings.
You need network objects that define the hosts or networks you will allow to make SSH connections to the device. You can add objects as part of the procedure, but if you want to use object groups to identify a group of IP addresses, ensure that the groups needed in the rules already exist. Select Objects > Object Management to configure objects.

Note
You cannot use the system-provided any network object. Instead, use any-ipv4 or any-ipv6.
Procedure
Step 1
Select Devices > Platform Settings and create or edit the threat defense policy.
Step 2
Select Secure Shell.
Step 3
Identify the interfaces and IP addresses that allow SSH connections.
Use this table to limit which interfaces will accept SSH connections, and the IP addresses of the clients who are allowed to make those connections. You can use network addresses rather than individual IP addresses.
Click Add to add a new rule, or click Edit to edit an existing rule.
Configure the rule properties:
IP Address—The network object or group that identifies the hosts or networks you are allowing to make SSH connections. Choose an object from the drop-down menu, or add a new network object by clicking +.
Security Zones—Add the zones that contain the interfaces to which you will allow SSH connections. For interfaces not in a zone, you can type the interface name into the field below the Selected Security Zone list and click Add. These rules will be applied to a device only if the device includes the selected interfaces or zones.
Click OK.
Step 4
Click Save.
You can now go to Deploy > Deployment and deploy the policy to assigned devices. The changes are not active until you deploy them.
Deploy the Configuration
Deploy the configuration changes to the threat defense; none of your changes are active on the device until you deploy them.
Procedure
Step 1
Click Deploy in the upper right.
Figure 8. Deploy
Step 2
Either click Deploy All to deploy to all devices or click Advanced Deploy to deploy to selected devices.
Figure 9. Deploy All
Figure 10. Advanced Deploy
Step 3
Ensure that the deployment succeeds. Click the icon to the right of the Deploy button in the menu bar to see status for deployments.
Figure 11. Deployment Status
Access the Threat Defense and FXOS CLI
Use the command-line interface (CLI) to set up the system and do basic system troubleshooting. You cannot configure policies through a CLI session. You can access the CLI by connecting to the console port.
You can also access the FXOS CLI for troubleshooting purposes.

Note
You can alternatively SSH to the Management interface of the threat defense device. Unlike a console session, the SSH session defaults to the threat defense CLI, from which you can connect to the FXOS CLI using the connect fxos command. You can later connect to the address on a data interface if you open the interface for SSH connections. SSH access to data interfaces is disabled by default. This procedure describes console port access, which defaults to the FXOS CLI.
Procedure
Step 1
To log into the CLI, connect your management computer to the console port. Be sure to install any necessary USB serial drivers for your operating system (see the Firepower 1100 hardware guide). The console port defaults to the FXOS CLI. Use the following serial settings:
9600 baud
8 data bits
No parity
1 stop bit
You connect to the FXOS CLI. Log in to the CLI using the admin username and the password you set at initial setup (the default is Admin123).
Example:
firepower login: admin
Password:
Last login: Thu May 16 14:01:03 UTC 2019 on ttyS0
Successful login attempts for user 'admin' : 1

firepower# 
Step 2
Access the threat defense CLI.
connect ftd
Example:
firepower# connect ftd
>
After logging in, for information on the commands available in the CLI, enter help or ? . For usage information, see Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Command Reference.
Step 3
To exit the threat defense CLI, enter the exit or logout command.
This command returns you to the FXOS CLI prompt. For information on the commands available in the FXOS CLI, enter ? .
Example:
> exit
firepower#
Troubleshoot Management Connectivity on a Data Interface
Model Support—Threat Defense
When you use a data interface for the management center instead of using the dedicated Management interface, you must be careful about changing the interface and network settings for the threat defense in the management center so you do not disrupt the connection. If you change the management interface type after you add the threat defense to the management center (from data to Management, or from Management to data), if the interfaces and network settings are not configured correctly, you can lose management connectivity.
This topic helps you troubleshoot the loss of management connectivity.
View management connection status
In the management center, check the management connection status on the Devices > Device Management > Device > Management > FMC Access Details > Connection Status page.
At the threat defense CLI, enter the sftunnel-status-brief command to view the management connection status. You can also use sftunnel-status to view more complete information.
See the following sample output for a connection that is down; there is no peer channel "connected to" information, nor heartbeat information shown:

Check for a successful DDNS update
At the threat defense CLI, check for a successful DDNS update:
debug ddns
> debug ddns
DDNS update request = /v3/update?hostname=domain.example.org&myip=209.165.200.225
Successfuly updated the DDNS sever with current IP addresses
DDNS: Another update completed, outstanding = 0
DDNS: IDB SB total = 0
If the update failed, use the debug http and debug ssl commands. For certificate validation failures, check that the root certificates are installed on the device:
show crypto ca certificates trustpoint_name
To check the DDNS operation:
show ddns update interface fmc_access_ifc_name
> show ddns update interface outside

Check Management Center log files
See https://cisco.com/go/fmc-reg-error.
Roll Back the Configuration if the Management Center Loses Connectivity
If you use a data interface on the threat defense for the management center, and you deploy a configuration change from the management center that affects the network connectivity, you can roll back the configuration on the threat defense to the last-deployed configuration so you can restore management connectivity. You can then adjust the configuration settings in the management center so that the network connectivity is maintained, and re-deploy. You can use the rollback feature even if you do not lose connectivity; it is not limited to this troubleshooting situation.
See the following guidelines:
Only the previous deployment is available locally on the threat defense; you cannot roll back to any earlier deployments.
Rollback is not supported for High Availability or Clustering deployments.
The rollback only affects configurations that you can set in the management center. For example, the rollback does not affect any local configuration related to the dedicated Management interface, which you can only configure at the threat defense CLI. Note that if you changed data interface settings after the last management center deployment using the configure network management-data-interface command, and then you use the rollback command, those settings will not be preserved; they will roll back to the last-deployed management center settings.
UCAPL/CC mode cannot be rolled back.
Out-of-band SCEP certificate data that was updated during the previous deployment cannot be rolled back.
During the rollback, connections will drop because the current configuration will be cleared.
Before you begin
Model Support—Threat Defense
Procedure
Step 1
At the threat defense CLI, roll back to the previous configuration.
configure policy rollback
After the rollback, the threat defense notifies the management center that the rollback was completed successfully. In the management center, the deployment screen will show a banner stating that the configuration was rolled back.
If the rollback failed, refer to https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/firepower-ngfw-virtual/215258-troubleshooting-firepower-threat-defense.html for common deployment problems. In some cases, the rollback can fail after the management center access is restored; in this case, you can resolve the management center configuration issues, and redeploy from the management center.
Example:
> configure policy rollback

The last deployment to this FTD was on June 1, 2020 and its status was Successful.
Do you want to continue [Y/N]?

Y

Rolling back complete configuration on the FTD. This will take time.
.....................
Policy rollback was successful on the FTD.
Configuration has been reverted back to transaction id: 
Following is the rollback summary:
...................
....................
>
Step 2
Check that the management connection was reestablished.
In the management center, check the management connection status on the Devices > Device Management > Device > Management > FMC Access Details > Connection Status page.
At the threat defense CLI, enter the sftunnel-status-brief command to view the management connection status.
If it takes more than 10 minutes to reestablish the connection, you should troubleshoot the connection. See Troubleshoot Management Connectivity on a Data Interface.
Power Off the Firewall Using the Management Center
It's important that you shut down your system properly. Simply unplugging the power or pressing the power switch can cause serious file system damage. Remember that there are many processes running in the background all the time, and unplugging or shutting off the power does not allow the graceful shutdown of your firewall.
You can shut down your system properly using the management center.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Devices > Device Management.
Step 2
Next to the device that you want to restart, click the edit icon ().
Step 3
Click the Device tab.
Step 4
Click the shut down device icon () in the System section.
Step 5
When prompted, confirm that you want to shut down the device.
Step 6
If you have a console connection to the firewall, monitor the system prompts as the firewall shuts down. You will see the following prompt:
System is stopped.
It is safe to power off now.

Do you want to reboot instead? [y/N]
If you do not have a console connection, wait approximately 3 minutes to ensure the system has shut down.
Step 7
You can now turn off the power switch and unplug the power to physically remove power from the chassis if necessary.
What's Next?
To continue configuring your threat defense, see the documents available for your software version at Navigating the Cisco Firepower Documentation.
