Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCvs05260 ISE Application server crash/restart due to cancellation of configuration backup
Problem Description
The Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) application server might unexpectedly restart when configuration backup is enabled.
Background
The specific trigger for this issue is when an ISE system configuration backup is cancelled while the backup operation is in progress. When this situation occurs, the associated configuration lock files are not completely cleared. As a result, the next time a configuration backup is triggered, a core file is generated and the ISE system restarts the application server without clearing the configuration lock files.
Problem Symptom
For the affected ISE versions, if ISE system configuration backup is cancelled while the backup operation is in progress, all three of the following symptoms will be observed:
Core files are generated and can be found via the CLI command as shown below. Please note that <hostname> represents the hostname of the ISE system and <pid> represents the process ID number that is unique to each ISE system.

<hostname>/admin# dir disk:/corefiles

  The configuration backup progress is stuck at 0%, as shown in the following image:


  The ISE application log file reflects the following exception:

#show logging application appserver/catalina.out

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
From hs_error file: 
# Problematic frame: 
# C [libc.so.6+0x13e638] __strchr_sse42+0x68 #
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Workaround/Solution
In order to resolve this issue, upgrade the ISE system software as shown for these releases:
ISE 2.4 Patch 12 or later 
ISE 2.6 Patch 7 or later
ISE 2.7 Patch 2 or later
ISE 3.0 or later
As a temporary workaround, restart the entire ISE system and perform a configuration backup (manual or scheduled). A full system restart clears the configuration lock files and allows an uninterrupted configuration backup. Do not cancel the configuration backup operation while it is in progress, as it will again lead to unresolved configuration lock files.
