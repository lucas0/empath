Olivia's story
Fate can play a hand in your career choice
I studied computer engineering in college and wanted to go into software development. But I didn’t want to be writing code all day, stuck in front of a computer. I really liked working with people and making connections and relationships outside of just technology. So, I wanted to explore different jobs, but I wasn’t sure what I wanted, until I received a scholarship to attend the Grace Hopper Conference for Women in Computing in 2019.
It was fate. At this conference and career fair, I spoke with a systems engineer who explained their job role and responsibilities and I decided this was the job for me! It was everything I was looking for.

You can have both a professional and a personal superpower—in one
My personal superpower is that I love to try new things. And I love to share the things I do with other people. It’s also a professional superpower because I love to talk about what I do with others. And that’s what a systems engineer does. I discuss technology with other people and try to understand my audience so I can communicate about the technology in a way that they’ll understand.
What does being a Cisco certification holder mean to you?
“The knowledge that I’ve got from studying for those certifications gave me the confidence that I’ll always be able to get a job if I need to.”
The certifications definitely changed my life. They helped me get a job at a large technology company and helped form my career trajectory. Plus the knowledge that I’ve got from studying for those certifications gave me the confidence that I’ll always be able to get a job if I need to.
What would you tell a friend to pursue his Cisco Certification?
I’d tell then them that it’s a great way to get a jump start on a career. It’s pretty much the first thing you need to get. You’ll get basic foundational knowledge on how networks function, which will basically guarantee you a first role in IT.
What would you tell your younger self?
“I’m still so young! I’d say don’t rush into anything. Maybe taking a little bit of time before going to a university or not accepting the first job offered would have been beneficial to finding something that I’m really passionate about. I found it eventually, with engineering, but looking back, I could have taken more time.”
