Introduction
This document describes the steps required to configure alarms based on the authorization result for a RADIUS authentication request on Identity Services Engine (ISE).
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:
RADIUS protocol
ISE admin access
Components Used
The information in this document is based on Identity Services Engine (ISE) 3.1.
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Background Information
In this example, a custom alarm would be configured for a specific authorization profile with a threshold limit defined and if ISE reaches the threshold limit on the configured authorization policy, the alarm would be triggered.
Configure
In this example, we will create an alarm for the authorization profile ("ad_user") pushed when an Active Directory (AD) user logs in and the alarm would be triggered based on the threshold configured.
Note: For a production server, the threshold must be a higher value to avoid large occurrences of the alarm.
Step 1. Navigate to Administration > System > Alarm Settings.
Step 2. Under Alarm Configuration, click Add to create an Alarm as shown in the image.
ISE 3.1 alarms based on authorization results - Alarm settings
Step 3. Select the Alarm Type as Authorization Result and enter the alarm name as shown in the image.
ISE 3.1 alarms based on authorization results - Configure alarm
Step 4. In the Threshold section, select Authorization in configured time period in Threshold On drop-down and enter appropriate values for Threshold and the mandatory fields. In the filter section, call the Authorization Profile for which the alarm must be triggered as shown in the image.
ISE 3.1 alarms based on authorization results - Configure alarm threshold
Note: Ensure the authorization profile used for alarm is defined under Policy > Policy Elements > Results > Authorization > Authorization Profiles.
Verify
Use this section in order to confirm that your configuration works properly.
When ISE pushes the authorization profile called in the alarm for RADIUS authentication request and meets the threshold condition within the polling interval, it would trigger the alarm seen in the ISE Dashboard as shown in the image. The trigger for alarm ad_user profile is that the profile is pushed more than 5 times (Threshold Value) in the last 20 minutes (polling interval).

Step 1. To check the alarm, navigate to ISE Dashboard and click on the ALARMS window. A new web page will open as shown:
ISE 3.1 alarms based on authorization results - Alarm notification
Step 2. To get more details of the alarm, select the alarm and it will give more details about the trigger and timestamp of the alarm.

Troubleshoot
This section provides information you can use in order to troubleshoot your configuration.
To troubleshoot issues related to alarm, the cisco-mnt component on the Monitoring node (MnT) must be enabled as the alarm evaluation happens on the MnT node. Navigate to Operations > Troubleshoot > Debug Wizard > Debug Log Configuration. Select the node on which Monitoring services are running and change the Log Level to Debug for Component Name cisco-mnt as shown:
