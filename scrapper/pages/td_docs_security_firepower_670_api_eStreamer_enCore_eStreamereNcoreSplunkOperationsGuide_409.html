  1  Introduction
1.1  Document Purpose
This document outlines the background and usage of the eStreamer eNcore for Splunk client to assist users with installation and execution.
1.2  Background
The Cisco Event Streamer (eStreamer) allows users to stream system intrusion, discovery, and connection data from a Firepower Management Center or managed device (the eStreamer server) to external client applications. eStreamer responds to client requests with terse, compact, binary encoded messages that facilitate high performance.
Historically, the eStreamer SDK has been wrapped with some additional code to create separate Perl applications (e.g., the Cisco eStreamer for Splunk app and the CEF agent).
1.3  Application Summary
eStreamer eNcore is a multi-platform, multi-process Python application that is compatible with Firepower Management Center versions 6.0 and above.
eNcore is an all-purpose client, which requests all possible events from eStreamer, parses the binary content, and outputs events in various formats to support other Security Information and Event Management tools (SIEMs). eNcore was built from scratch in Python with a scalable and fast multi-process architecture. It supports version 6.0 of Firepower Management Center. It was built and tested on CentOS 7, but should work with any Linux distribution that supports the pre-requisites. The software will run on Windows but is not supported.
1.3.1  Cisco eStreamer eNcore add-on for Splunk (TA-eStreamer)
The eStreamer eNcore add-on for Splunk is a technology add-on that contains the core eNcore eStreamer client code as well as:
—      Data inputs (inputs.conf) for data, logs and status
—      Parsing hints (props.conf)
—      An extension which allows eNcore to live and die with Splunk
Note: The eNcore for Splunk add-on is not supported on Splunk for Windows.
1.3.2  Cisco eStreamer eNcore Dashboard for Splunk (eStreamer Dashboard)
This is an application which includes the same user interface elements as the old Cisco eStreamer for Splunk app (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1629/). The application contains no code or collector elements, however. It is simply a UI application with some pre-defined searches, macros, eventtypes and workflow actions.

  2  Prerequisites
The eNcore add-on for Splunk and the eNcore Dashboard for Splunk do not require any special prerequisites. They are downloadable from Splunkbase and they install in the search head in the same way as other add-ons and applications.
The eNcore add-on for Splunk requires Python 3.6+ and openSSL, in the latest Splunk 8.0 release Python3 is included, however the python mods for openssl are not included, which require additional configuration steps outlined in this update. If the Splunk install was customized and is missing one or both of these components, they will need to be installed for the add-on to function.
3  Installation
Note: The eNcore for Splunk add-on is not supported on Splunk for Windows.
3.1 Installing the eNcore add-on for Splunk (TA-eStreamer)
To install the eNcore add-on for Splunk, either:
a.     Download the add-on from http://apps.splunk.com/app/3662 and use the "Install app from file" feature in Splunk to then upload and install the add-on, or
b.     Use the "Browse more apps" feature in Splunk and search for “eNcore”, then look for Cisco eStreamer Add-on for Splunk in the search results and click Install for that add-on.
  You must install a PKCS12 certificate for your Splunk server, which allows the Firepower Management Center to authenticate the identity of the add-on when the eNcore client contacts the Firepower Management Center and establishes a secure tunnel. You create the PKCS12 certificate on the Firepower Management Center, download it, and copy it to this location on the Splunk server (renaming it client.pkcs12):
$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-eStreamer/bin/encore/client.pkcs12
For more information on creating a PKCS12 certificate and copying it to the Splunk server, see Appendix A.
3.2 Installing the eNcore Dashboard for Splunk (eStreamer Dashboard)
To install the eNcore Dashboard for Splunk, either:
a.     Download the app from http://apps.splunk.com/app/3663 and use the "Install app from file" feature in Splunk to then upload and install the add-on, or
b.     Use the "Browse more apps" feature in Splunk and search for “eNcore”, then look for Cisco Firepower eNcore App for Splunk in the search results and click Install for that app.

  4  eNcore Add-on for Splunk Setup Configuration
4.1  Enable Data Inputs
The eNcore add-on for Splunk writes events to log files in the installation's data directory. Splunk must be configured with a Data Input that reads the events from this directory.
To do this, navigate to Settings > Data Inputs > Files & Directories and enable the data input with the path $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-eStreamer/data and Source type cisco:estreamer:data).  
4.2  Enable Scripts
The eNcore add-on for Splunk has three scripts that that perform important operations:
■        cisco:estreamer:clean – this script has no output but is used to delete data files older than 12 hours
■        cisco:estreamer:log – this script uses the stdout of eNcore to take program log data. This becomes very useful where things are not going to plan. More importantly, it is the script which starts the eStreamer eNcore process.
■        cisco:estreamer:status – this script runs periodically to maintain a clear status of whether the program is running
These scripts must be enabled by navigating to Settings > Data Inputs > Scripts and clicking enable for the three TA-eStreamer scripts.
4.3  eNcore Add-on Setup Configuration
  Navigate to the TA-eStreamer bin directory, located in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-eStreamer/bin, where $SPLUNK_HOME represents the home directory of your Splunk Heavy Forwarder installation.
  You will want to set the homepath of your SPLUNK_HOME install variable, this can be done on the command line by editing the startup script, remove the commented out line for the SPLUNK_HOME variable and set it to your install path, in Linux this is typically /opt/splunk,
    In CentOS you may see the error,
**/opt/splunk/bin/openssl: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.0.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory**
  To resolve this you need to add one additional setup variable for the Splunk Lib path, it is commented out in the script, you will need to run the following command prior to executing the setup script.
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SPLUNK_HOME/lib

example: LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/splunk/lib

https://community.splunk.com/t5/Archive/Splunk-OPEN-SSL-unable-to-load-library-files/m-p/229021



      Next we’ll need to modify the estreamer.conf file, $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-eStreamer/bin/encore.  Set the  “host" field to the IP or hostname of your FMC,  see section 6.7 for more details.
Next: Edit the settings: false, change it to true
Run the ./splencore.sh test command, and enter the FMC IP Address
Copy the two commands and run those each individually, enter the pkcs password when prompted
Command #1 :  Generate the pkcs certificate using Splunk’s built-in open ssl, the test utility will generate this command for you provided.  This command can also be run manually using the following format:
  $SPLUNK_HOME/apps/TA-eStreamer/bin# $SPLUNK_HOME/bin /openssl pkcs12 -in $SPLUNK_HOME /etc/apps/TA-eStreamer/bin/encore/"client.pkcs12" -nocerts -nodes -out “$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-eStreamer/bin/encore/$FMC_IP-8302_pkcs.key"
  Example:  /opt/splunk/bin/openssl pkcs12 -in /opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-eStreamer/bin/encore/"client.pkcs12" -clcerts -nokeys -out "/opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-eStreamer/bin/encore/64.100.13.164-8302_pkcs.cert"
    Command #2
  Generate the key file, the command will be generated for you on the startup script, but it can also be run manually using the following format,
  Example:  /opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-eStreamer/bin# /opt/splunk/bin/openssl pkcs12 -in /opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-eStreamer/bin/encore/"client.pkcs12" -nocerts -nodes -out "/opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-eStreamer/bin/encore/64.100.13.164-8302_pkcs.key"
 
Run the test command to ensure valid SSL handshake is in place
 
  5  Operation
Once you have fully configured all items as described in section 4, the eNcore add-on for Splunk is started by checking the Is enabled? check box on the add-on setup page and clicking Save as described in section 4.3.
Following execution, the operation of the add-on can be monitored by searching for status, log, and data events:
■        To check the status, search for sourcetype="cisco:estreamer:status"
■        To check more detailed log output, search for sourcetype="cisco:estreamer:log"
■        To look for eStreamer data, search for sourcetype=" cisco:estreamer:data"
  For further analysis of the Firepower events consider installing either:
■        Cisco Firepower App for Splunk
   
  6 Configuration Options
This default configuration provided by the eNcore for Splunk add-on in the estreamer.conf file provides an optimal configuration for many deployments. However, some options that may need to be adjusted by the user in certain circumstances. This section provides details regarding several of these options. The complete list of settings is provided in Appendix B.
6.1  The Monitor
  The monitor is a separate thread that runs monitoring and maintenance tasks. By default, it runs every two minutes. It writes the number of events handled to the eNcore log and checks the status of subprocesses. If are any problems with subprocesses, the monitor places the client into an error state and the client shuts itself down.
An example of messages written to the log by the monitor thread is shown below.
  Several aspects of the log messages can be configured in the monitor section of the estreamer.conf configuration file, which is located in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-eStreamer/bin/encore/estreamer.conf.
  The aspects that can be configured are:
■        period: The interval in seconds at which the monitor performs its check of subprocesses and writes status messages to the log.
■        bookmark: If true, the bookmark (the time of the latest event in Unix time format) is included in each monitor log message
■        handled: If true, the number of events that eNcore has handled since being started.
■        details: If true, then in addition to the brief status message that the monitor writes to the log, it will also write a detailed message containing many status items related to the operation of the eNcore client.
  An example of the configuration of these parameters in the estreamer.conf file is shown here:
    "monitor": {
        "period": 120,
        "bookmark": false,
        "handled": true,
        "details": true
    },
  6.2  Start Time
The eStreamer server expects the client request to state the start time, which specifies that the Firepower Management Center should only send events that occurred after the start time. There are three options:
■        0: Send all events from the earliest point available on the Firepower Management Center
■        1: Send all events that occur after receiving the client request
■        2: Use a bookmark to pick up where we left off. First run is from 0
  An example of the start configuration in the estreamer.conf file is shown here:
    "@startComment": "0 for genesis, 1 for now, 2 for bookmark",
    "start": 2,
6.3  Outputters
By default, only the Splunk outputter is enabled. It writes its data to a relative file location, but you may want to output the data to a different location. To change this, alter the stream.uri property to file:///absolute/file/path/filename{0}.ext where {0} is the timestamp placeholder.
An example of the outputters configuration in the estreamer.conf file is shown here:
          "outputters": [
            {
                "name": "Splunk default",
                "adapter": "splunk",
                "enabled": true,
                "stream": {
                    "uri": "relfile:///data/splunk/encore.log{0}",
                    "options": {
                        "rotate": true,
                        "maxLogs": 9999
                    }
                }
            },
  6.4  Performance Tuning
The performance of the eNcore for Splunk add-on has been improved in version 4.0.9 with the addition of multi-processing. By default, four worker processes operate on the incoming messages to achieve higher throughput. While multiple processes can provide significant performance gains, these gains are highly dependent on the platform because for each platform, the processing bottlenecks may be different. Multiple processes also require additional overhead for managing task distribution, so that increasing the number of processes could actually decrease the performance on platforms with a low number of CPU cores.
The number of worker processes is configurable through the workerProcesses parameter in the estreamer.conf configuration file. The number can be set from 1 to 12. Generally, the more capable the platform (i.e., more CPU cores, better I/O, etc.), more throughput is achieved through a higher number of worker processes. However, the only reliable approach is to test performance with various settings such as 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12, and in many cases the best performance may be gained with just one worker process because no process marshalling is required.
One scenario for testing is to:
1.     Disable the add-on's Data Input in Splunk, because the same events will be requested multiple times during the testing.
2.     Configure a set number of workerProcesses (such as 8) and then start eNcore with a start parameter of 0 (for genesis) or at least an old start time.
3.     Request connection events from the Firepower Management Center (or in some other way request the Firepower Management Center send millions of backlogged events).
4.     Observe the event rate reported by the monitor process in the estreamer.log file.
5.     Repeat the test with a different number of workerProcesses.
6.     When the optimal number has been determined, set the workerProcesses to that number and enable the add-on's Data Input to resume production operations.
An example of the workerProcesses configuration in the estreamer.conf file is shown here:
        "workerProcesses": 12

6.5  Batch Size
The eNcore for Splunk add-on also attempts to improve performance by batching received events and only writing them to output when the threshold for the batch has been reached. The default batch size is 100 events.
If the event rate is very low, then a batch size of 100 events could cause an unwanted delay in the appearance of events in Splunk. For example, if intrusion events are the only events that are handled and the intrusion event rate averages 100 events per hour, then the first event in a batch will often be delayed an hour or more while the batch completes and is written to disk. To reduce such delays the batchSize can be set to a lower value, or to eliminate them entirely, the batchSize can be set to 1.
The disadvantage of setting batchSize to 1, is that in high-throughput environments, the overall event rate will be lower.
An example of the batchSize configuration in the estreamer.conf file is shown here:
            "batchSize": 50
 
  6.6 Persisting a connection
It can be advantage to persist the client indefinitely to listen for a stream of data from the FMC, or have eNcore automatically restart after a Splunk outage, this can be achieved by setting the following configuration value
        "alwaysAttemptToContinue": true
  6.7 Host
By default a generic place holder is defined within the estreamer.conf, you will want to change this to the IP or HOST name of your FMC.  As of this writing only ipv4 addresses are supported
“host”: “1.2.3.4”
      7  Troubleshooting
7.1  Error messages
The eNcore for Splunk add-on is engineered to provide meaningful error messages. Below is an example error message.
The eStreamer service has closed the connection. There are a number of possible causes which may show above in the error log.
If you see no errors then this could be that
 * the server is shutting down
 * there has been a client authentication failure (please check that your outbound IP address matches that associated with your certificate - note that if your device is subject to NAT then the certificate IP must match the upstream NAT IP)
 * there is a problem with the server. If you are running Firepower Management Center v6.0, you may need to install "Sourcefire 3D Defense Center S3 Hotfix AZ 6.1.0.3-1")
If you encounter errors that do not make sense or require further explanation, then please contact support so that we can fix the problem and improve the error messages.
7.2  Frequently Asked Questions
Can I connect to more than one Firepower Management Center?
Currently, not within a single instance.
Can eNcore de-duplicate data to keep my SIEM costs lower?
Not today. It is on the roadmap.
Can I run two instances of eNcore in a HA pair?
Yes and no. It is technically possible to run two side-by-side, but they will be completely ignorant of each other and output double the data. It may be preferable to run them in a hot-stand-by configuration where the primary client’s state and configuration data is regularly copied to the secondary client. The state and configuration data in question are comprised of:
■        estreamer.conf
■        x.x.x.x-port_bookmark.dat
■        x.x.x.x-port_cache.dat
■        x.x.x.x-port_pkcs.cert
■        x.x.x.x-port_pkcs.key
■        x.x.x.x-port_status.dat
  Can I increase the logging granularity?
Yes, by changing logging.level in the estreamer.conf file. Please note that while it is possible to increase this level to VERBOSE, the performance impact will be crippling. DEBUG may be useful but slow. We strongly recommend not going above INFO for standard production execution.

  9  Appendix A: Client Certificate Creation and Installation
9.1  Firepower Management Center eStreamer Client Certificate Creation
The steps to generate an eStreamer client certificate are as follows:
1.     Navigate to the web interface of the Firepower Management Center at https://fmc-ip-address and log in with your Firepower Management Center credentials.
2.     In the Firepower Management Center 6.x GUI, navigate to System > Integration > eStreamer.

Firepower Management Center eStreamer Certificate Creation
    3.     Click Create Client.
4.     Provide the Hostname and password.
Note: This should be the IP of the client, which will be collecting the event data from the Firepower Management Center. The password you enter here will be required when you first execute eStreamer eNcore.
Please note that the IP address you enter here must be the IP address of the eStreamer-eNcore client from the perspective of the Firepower Management Center. In other words, if the client is behind a NAT device, then the IP address must be that of the upstream NAT interface.
Create Client Hostname and Password Screen
    5.     Click Save.
Create Client Save Screen
    6.     Download the PKCS12 file by clicking the Download icon at the right.
  Download Screen
    7.     Copy the PKCS12 file to the desired location in the target device. By default, eStreamer-eNcore will look for /path/eStreamer_eNcore/client.pkcs12. If you wish to use a different filename, then you must edit the estreamer.conf file.

  10  Appendix B: List of Configuration Options
The following table provides a comprehensive list of configuration options for the eNcore for Splunk add-on.
  Key
Definition
Enabled
true | false. Controls whether eNcore will run.
connectTimeout
The duration in seconds the client will wait for a connection to establish before failing.
responseTimeout
The duration in seconds the client will wait for a response before timing out.
monitor.details
true | false. Controls whether the monitor writes a detailed status message to the log.
monitor.period
The period in seconds between each execution of monitor tasks. Default is 120. Lower numbers are useful for debugging but will create more log traffic.
monitor.bookmark
true | false. True will show the last bookmark timestamp. This is useful to see how far behind the eNcore client is.
monitor.handled
true | false. True will report the total number of events written to output.
Start
0 specifies oldest data available
1 specifies data as of now
2 specifies use of bookmark
logging.level
Levels include FATAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, VERBOSE, and TRACE. Select the level of logging as per your requirement. It is strongly recommended that you do not use anything above INFO for production environments. DEBUG will generate very large log files and TRACE will significantly affect performance.
logging.format
This describes the format of the log and how they are stored. Default configuration setting for message format is “{date-time}-{name of module}-{level of logging-message}”.
logging.stdOut
true | false. This determines whether log output is also shown in Standard Output.
logging.filepath
This specifies the location of the application log.
subscription.servers[]
While this is an array, eNcore can only currently support one server. The array is to support the future ability to connect to multiple hosts.
server.host
The IP address of the Firepower Management Center (eStreamer Server). Default configuration is 1.2.3.4. If you change the host entry after having run eNcore then new cache, bookmark and metadata files will be generated.
server.port
The server port to connect to. Default 8302.
server.pkcs12Filepath
The PKCS12 filepath location. If you change this having already run eNcore, then you must also delete the cached public and private key otherwise eNcore will continue to use those. They are called {host}-{port}_pkcs.cert and {host}-{port}_pkcs.key.
server.tlsVersion
Valid options are 1.0 and 1.2.
subscription.records
Do not change these values.
handler.records.metadata
true | false. If you wish to exclude the output of metadata (since it has no timestamp information) then set this to false.
handler.records.flows
true | false. If you wish to exclude connection flow records then set this to false.
handler.outputters[]
An array of outputter controllers which define the behavior and format of what gets written by eNcore.
outputter.name
This is a human readable name for your convenience. It is unused by the code.
outputter.adapter
Data is read from eStreamer and stored in a structured internal format. The adapter transforms the data to a desired format. Recognized values are:
—      splunk
—      json
outputter.enabled
true | false. You can have more than one outputter specified at once. If you wish to disable a specific outputter, set this flag to false. If all outputters are false (or there are no outputters) then it behaves as a sink.
outputter.passthru
true | false. If true then data flowing through bypasses decoding and metadata processing. It is very fast but of limited use. Its primary purpose is for debugging.
outputter.stream.uri
Specify the location where the output will be stored. You can specify a file URI as normal (e.g., file:///absolute/path/to/file) or a relative filepath (relfile:////relative/path/to/file).
  Only file URLs are supported currently.
outputter.stream.options
File-based streams require additional options.
option.rotate
true | false. Set if you want log rotation. Default configuration setting for this is true. Please note that eNcore will not delete any old files. If you wish to do that, you will need to script it separately and schedule it.
Example:
Call this from a cron job.
#!/bin/bash
find /opt/splunk/etc/apps/eStreamer/log/* -mmin +1440 -exec rm {} \;
option.maxLogs
Specify the size of the log (number of lines). Default configuration for this is 10,000. You can have fewer, larger files (e.g, 50,000).
workerProcesses
Specify the number of worker processes, from 1 to 12, to optimize performance. See section 6.4 for guidance on setting this option.
batchSize
Specify the threshold for a batch. See section 6.5 for guidance on setting the batch size.
