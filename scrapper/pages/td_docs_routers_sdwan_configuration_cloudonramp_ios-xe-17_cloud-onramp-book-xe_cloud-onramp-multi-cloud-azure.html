Cisco vManage Release 20.4.1
This feature enhances Cloud OnRamp integration with Microsoft Azure by allowing Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge Software (Cisco Catalyst 8000V) to be deployed inside the Azure Virtual WAN Hub instead of deploying it in transit VNets. It also automates the Cisco SD-WAN fabric connection to Azure Virtual WAN Hub through Cisco Catalyst 8000V. The connectivity between inter-region Azure Virtual WAN Hubs is also supported.
In addition, you can convert the Azure virtual WAN hubs created using Cisco vManage into secured hubs by deploying Azure firewall inside them. However, secured virtual hubs can only be configured using the Microsoft Azure portal.
Integration of Cisco SD-WAN and Azure Virtual WAN Hub Using Azure Portal
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.4.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.4.1
As part of the integration of Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN with Azure Virtual WAN, you can also use the Azure portal to upload bootstrap configuration files for Cisco Catalyst 8000V instances. These instances can then be used to create a virtual WAN hub using the Azure portal.
Routing Traffic Flow to a Virtual Hub Firewall or a Local Firewall
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1
This feature enables you to route Microsoft Azure Virtual WAN hub traffic to a firewall on a local branch router, or direct local branch traffic to an Azure secured virtual hub, to be subject to the security policies of the Azure Firewall Manager.
Azure Scaling, Audit, and Security of Network Virtual Appliances
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.1a

Azure Virtual WAN Hub Integration with Cisco SD-WAN
Minimum supported releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.4.1a and Cisco vManage Release 20.4.1
The integration of the Cisco SD-WAN solution with Azure virtual WAN enhances Cloud OnRamp for Multicloud deployments and enables configuring Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge Software (Cisco Catalyst 8000V) as a network virtual appliance (NVA) in Azure Virtual WAN Hubs.
This integration simplifies the consumption model for cloud services because it eliminates the need to create a transit virtual network (VNet) and you can control your host VNet connectivity directly through the Azure Virtual WAN Hub. Azure Virtual WAN is a networking service that provides optimized and automated branch-to-branch connectivity through Microsoft Azure. It enables you to connect and configure branch devices that can communicate with Azure. Configuring Cisco Catalyst 8000V instances inside Azure virtual hubs provides higher speeds and bandwidth and overcomes the speed and bandwidth limitation of using transit VNets.
Cloud OnRamp for IaaS Versus Cloud OnRamp for Multicloud
This table lists the differences between Cloud OnRamp for IaaS and Cloud OnRamp for Multicloud in the context of Microsoft Azure Integration.

How Virtual WAN Hub Integration Works
Connectivity Models
How Virtual WAN Hub Integration Works
The connection between the overlay network and a public-cloud application is provided by a pair of redundant Cisco Catalyst 8000V instances that are configured inside the Azure virtual WAN hub as part of the Cloud OnRamp for Multicloud workflow for Azure. Using redundant routers to form the transit offers path resiliency to the public cloud.
The Cloud OnRamp for Multicloud flow in Cisco vManage discovers your existing VNets in geographical cloud regions and allows you to connect select VNets to the overlay network. In such a scenario, Cloud OnRamp for Multicloud allows simple integration between legacy public-cloud connections and the Cisco SD-WAN overlay network.
A configuration wizard in Cisco vManage automates the bring-up of the Azure Virtual WAN Hub to connect with your public cloud account. The wizard also automates the connections between public-cloud applications and the users of those applications at branches in the overlay network. Using tags, Cisco vManage enables you to map the service VPNs in your branches with specific VNets in your public cloud infrastructure.
VNet to VPN Mapping
The Intent Management workflow in Cisco vManage enables connectivity between Cisco SD-WAN VPNs (branch networks) and VNets, and VNets to VNets. VNets are represented by tags created under the Discover workflow for Cloud OnRamp for Multicloud. When VNets are mapped to connect them to the virtual WAN hubs, they are assigned a default route and propagate to the default label. When you create VNet tags within an Azure region, mapping is automatically created based on the other VNets and VPNs that share the same tag.
When Cisco vManage records the intent for connectivity, mapping is realized in cloud in regions where the cloud gateway is present. Mapping intents can be entered without cloud gateways being present in different regions. Your mapping intent is preserved and realized when a new cloud gateway or mapping change is discovered. As and when cloud gateways get instantiated or discovered in different regions, the mapping intents are realized in those regions. Similarly, tagging operations can influence the mapping in different regions as well and mappings as per the tags are realized in the cloud.

Note
The VPNs selected to be mapped to VNet tags must not have overlapping IP addresses. This is because segmentation is not supported in Microsoft Azure Virtual WAN.
Inter-region Azure Hub-to-Hub connectivity is enabled by creating VNet tags and mapping them to your VPN sites. No additional configuration is required to enable inter-region hub-to-hub connectivity. VNets are associated with the Virtual WAN Hub for their respective regions. If VNets in different Azure regions share the same VNet tag, the connectivity between such VNets is automatically established and is carried out through the respective Virtual WAN Hubs that the VNets are connected to.
Components of Azure Virtual WAN Integration Workflow
A cloud gateway to connect your branches and data centers to the public cloud infrastructure is a logical object that hosts Cisco Catalyst 8000V instances. It comprises Azure Resource Groups, Azure Virtual WAN, and Azure Virtual WAN Hub.
Resource Groups
All Azure networking resources belong to a resource group and resource groups are created under Azure subscriptions. For Azure cloud gateways, Azure virtual WAN, and Azure Virtual WAN Hub are created under a resource group.
The first step to create an Azure cloud gateways is therefore to create a resource group.
After a resource group is created, you can configure Azure Virtual WAN.
Azure Virtual WAN
Azure Virtual WAN is the backbone of the Azure networking service. It's created under an existing Azure resource group. An Azure Virtual WAN can contain multiple Azure virtual hubs within it, as long as each virtual hub belongs to a different Azure region. Only one virtual hub per Azure region is supported.
After a virtual WAN has been defined under a resource group in a region, the next step is to create an Azure Virtual WAN Hub.
Azure Virtual WAN Hubs
The Azure virtual WAN Hub manages the core connectivity between your VPN sites and NVAs, and VNets. Once a virtual hub is created, the Cisco Catalyst 8000V instances can be integrated into the Azure networking service.
Connectivity Models
With the Integration of Azure Virtual WAN with the Cisco SD-WAN solution, the following connectivity models are supported:
SD-WAN branch to Azure Host VNets within the same Azure region
Inter-region Azure virtual hub-to-virtual hub connectivity
SD-WAN Branch to Azure Host VNets (Single-region)
Figure 1. VNet to VNet Mapping within the Same Azure Region
In this scenario, the virtual hub is standalone and isn't connected to the virtual hubs in other Azure regions. In such cases, the VNets belong to the same region as the virtual hub, and are connected to your branch VPNs using VNet tags that are defined in Cisco vManage.
Virtual WAN Hub to Virtual WAN Hub (Inter-region)
Figure 2. Inter-region VNet-VNet Mapping Through Virtual Hubs
This image represents hub-to-hub connectivity with Azure backbone. This connectivity need not be configured separately. It's automatically achieved if VNets in different Azure regions share the same VNet tag.
Routing Traffic Flow to a Secured Virtual Hub or a Local Firewall
Minimum supported releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a and Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1
The Microsoft Azure environment includes a virtual hub that enables connectivity between Azure Virtual Network (VNet) workloads and local branch devices. The integration of Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN and the Azure environment enables the following firewall options:
Routing outgoing internet traffic in the Azure Virtual WAN hub to a firewall on a local branch router
Routing outgoing internet traffic from a local branch router to an Azure secured virtual hub, to be subject to the security policies of the Azure Firewall Manager.

Note
An Azure secured virtual hub is an Azure Virtual WAN hub that has security and routing policy managed by the Azure Firewall Manager.
In both cases, return traffic follows the same path as outgoing internet traffic, so the same firewall policy applies to traffic in both directions.
Azure Virtual WAN Audit
Minimum supported releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.1a and Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1
The multicloud audit service compares the information from the Cisco SD-WAN Manager database with the information in the Azure cloud database. This information includes Azure virtual WAN, virtual hubs, network virtual appliances, virtual networks, and VPN-to-virtual network mapping. Later, Cloud OnRamp for Multicloud compares the results, identifies the discrepancies, and displays a list of Microsoft Azure objects with and without errors.
From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.8.1a and Cisco vManage Release 20.8.1, the audit function incorporates the following enhancements:
After you initiate an on-demand audit, the Cloud OnRamp for Multicloud audit service identifies and lists discrepancies between the information in the Cisco vManage database and the information in the Azure cloud. You can choose to fix all the discrepancies together or select a discrepancy and fix it individually. When you check a check box adjacent to an individual discrepancy, a brief explanation of the issue appears below the discrepancy.
For more details about the audit discrepancies and resolutions, see Audit Discrepancies and Resolutions.
You can now enable or disable periodic audits. For details, see Enable Periodic Audit.

SKU Scale Value of Network Virtual Appliances
Minimum supported releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.1a and Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1
You can edit the SKU scale value of a Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge instance in Azure. In releases earlier than Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.1a and Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1, the SKU scale value is not editable. If you want to change the SKU scale value, you must delete and re-create the cloud gateway with a new SKU scale value.
You can opt for higher SKU scale values for better performance and lower values for cost-effectiveness.

Note
After editing the SKU scale value, expect a network downtime of 3 to 4 minutes.
For details about the supported SKU scales, see Supported Azure Instances for Azure Virtual WAN Integration.
Security Rules Configuration of Network Virtual Appliances
Minimum supported releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.1a and Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1
Microsoft Azure has an option to edit the security rules of Network Virtual Appliances (NVAs). Cisco SD-WAN Manager supports the configuration of these security rules for NVAs.
Cisco Catalyst 8000V NVAs that are launched during cloud gateway creation prohibit the use of all the inbound ports, except Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN-related ports. The Security Rules Configuration of NVA feature allows you to enable a particular port as required, for example, for debugging purposes. After you add a new NVA rule to enable a port, it remains active only for two hours. Simultaneously, adding another NVA rule restarts the timer, and now all the enabled ports remain active for two hours.

Note
Security rules of NVAs are not configurable when the cloud gateway operations are in progress.
The source IP address for Azure can only have /30, /31, or /32 as suffixes. Examples of the source IP address for Azure are 192.0.2.0/30, 192.0.2.0/31, 192.0.2.0/32.
Information About Azure ExpressRoute Connection to NVA
Minimum supported releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.8.1a and Cisco vManage Release 20.8.1
From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.8.1a and Cisco vManage Release 20.8.1, Cisco SD-WAN Manager supports ExpressRoute connections from branch offices to NVAs through SD-WAN tunnels. Express route connections are private networks that offer high reliability, few latencies, and fast connections for data transfer.
For further details about Azure ExpressRoute Connection to NVA, see Alternative Azure Designs.
Information about Multiple Virtual Hubs in Each Region
Minimum supported release: Cisco vManage Release 20.11.1

Note
This feature is supported on both Azure Cloud and Azure Government Cloud.
For organizations with thousands of sites connected to Azure in a single region, Microsoft supports creation of multiple cloud gateways, and up to eight virtual hubs for a single region.
For Cisco vManage Release 20.10.1 and earlier releases, the Azure Virtual WAN solution supports only a single virtual hub in a single region. From Cisco vManage Release 20.11.1, the solution supports multiple virtual hubs in each region.
The cloud gateway attachment to a virtual network is based on a load balancing algorithm. When you add a tag to the cloud gateway attachment, you can choose Auto which distributes the VNets based on the load balancing algorithm. When you create a new cloud gateway, you can choose to redistribute VNets to load balance the existing VNets among all the cloud gateways. You can only reassign VNets across cloud gateways when you choose the Auto VNet tag. You cannot reassign the dedicated VNet tags that are attached to cloud gateways.

In the Virtual WAN field, choose a Azure Virtual WAN from the drop-down list. Alternatively, click Create New to create a new Azure Virtual WAN.
In the Virtual HUB field, choose an Azure Virtual WAN Hub from the drop-down list. Alternatively, click Create New to create a new Azure Virtual WAN Hub.
(Minimum supported release: Cisco vManage Release 20.11.1) When you select the Region, Resource Group, and Virtual WAN, the Azure Virtual WAN Hub field displays Create a new vHub using Cloud Gateway Name. From the drop-down list, select the discovered virtual hubs.
The virtual hubs are discovered on Cisco vManage in two ways:
Virtual hubs with Network Virtual Appliances (NVAs) created on the Azure portal.
Virtual hubs created in the Azure portal and discovered by Cisco vManage. You can then add the NVAs to the virtual hubs in Cisco vManage.
(Minimum release: Cisco vManage Release 20.10.1) From the Site Name drop-down list, choose a site for which you want to create the cloud gateway.
In the Settings field, choose one of the following:
Default - The default values of IP subnet pool, image version, and SKU Scale size are retrieved from global settings.
Customized - you can override the global settings with this option. This options is applicable only for the newly created cloud gateway.
(Minimum supported release: Cisco vManage Release 20.10.1)
In the Instance Setting area, the following fields are auto-populated with the configurations from the global settings only when you onboard the virtual hubs with Cisco Catalyst 8000V created on Azure portal to Cisco vManage:
Software Image
SKU Scale
IP Subnet Pool
UUID (specify 2)

Note
When the cloud gateways are onboarded on Cisco vManage, without the NVAs, the IP Subnet Pool and UUID (specify 2) fields are auto-populated.
You can override the global settings by selecting the options in the drop-down list.
In the UUID (specify 2) field, choose two Cisco Catalyst 8000V licenses from the drop-down list.

Note
From Cisco vManage Release 20.10.1, the UUIDs are auto-populated when you choose a site from the Site Name drop-down list.
(Minimum release: Cisco vManage Release 20.10.1) In the Multi-Region Fabric Settings area, for MRF Role, choose Border or Edge.
This option is available only when Multi-Region Fabric is enabled.
Click Add.

Note
It can take up to 40 minutes for your Azure Virtual WAN hub to be created and for the Cisco Catalyst 8000V instances to be provisioned inside the virtual hub.

Note
Once the creation of the Azure Virtual WAN Hub is complete, you have the option to convert it into a secured Azure Virtual WAN Hub. However, this configuration can only be completed through the Microsoft Azure portal. See Microsoft Azure documentation for more information.

Note
You can simultaneously create Azure cloud gateways in different regions.
Before creating multiple cloud gateways in different regions, create the resource group, virtual WAN, and storage account for the first cloud gateway.
Before creating multiple cloud gateways in the same region, create the virtual hub for the first cloud gateway in the region.

Note
The Cloud OnRamp for Multicloud workflow supports up to eight virtual hubs in each Azure region. You can deploy two cloud gateway Network Virtual Appliances (NVAs) in each virtual hub.
Discover Host VNets and Create Tags
After you create an Azure virtual hub, you can discover your host VNets in the region of the virtual hub.
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Cloud OnRamp for Multicloud.
In the Discover workflow, click Host Private Networks.
In the Cloud Provider field, choose Microsoft Azure.
A list of your host VNets displays in a table with the following columns: Cloud Region, Account Name, VNET Tag, Cloud Gateway Attachment, Account ID, Resource Group, and VNet Name.
Click the Tag Actions drop-down list to choose any of the following:
Add Tag: Create a tag for a VNet or a group of VNets.
(Minimum supported release: Cisco vManage Release 20.11.1) You can choose the Cloud Gateway Attachment as Auto or map with an existing cloud gateway.
Edit Tag: Change the existing tag of a selected VNet.
(Minimum supported release: Cisco vManage Release 20.11.1) You can choose the Cloud Gateway Attachment from the Edit Tag. The Auto option is automatically selected, if you choose not to make a selection or if the cloud gateway is not yet created in that region. The Auto option is based on a load balancing algorithm. For VNets with the Auto option selected, the cloud gateway attachments are selected during mapping and not when the tag is created.
Delete Tag: Delete the tag for the selected VNet.
Map VNets Tags and Branch Network VPNs
To enable VNet to VPN mapping, you select a set of VNets in one or multiple Azure regions and define a tag. You then select the service VPNs that you want to map the VNets to using the same tags. Only a single set of VNets can be mapped to a single set of branch offices. All selected VNets are visible to all selected VPNs and vice versa. One service VPN can be mapped to a single or multiple tags. Multiple VNets could have the same tag. Mapping is automatically realized when a cloud gateway exists in the same region or when tagging operations take place.

Note
The VPNs selected to be mapped to VNet tags must not have overlapping IP addresses. This is because segmentation is not supported in Microsoft Azure Virtual WAN.
To edit the VNet-VPN mapping for your SD-WAN networks, follow these steps:
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Cloud OnRamp for Multicloud.
Under, Intent Management click Connectivity.
To define the intent, click Edit.
Choose the cells that correspond to a VPN and the VNet tags associated with it, and click Save.
The Intent Management - Connectivity window displays the connectivity status between the branch VPNs and the VNet tags they are mapped to. A legend is available at the top of the screen to help you understand the various statuses. Click any of the cells in the matrix displayed to get a more detailed status information, such as, Mapped, Unmapped, and Outstanding mapping.
Rebalance VNets
Minimum supported release: Cisco vManage Release 20.11.1
You can choose to redistribute VNets to load balance the existing VNets among all the cloud gateways in a region for a given tag at any time. You can reassign only the VNets with Auto option selected across cloud gateways. The VNets assignment is based on a load-balancing algorithm. As the rebalancing involves detachment and re-attachments of VNETs to cloud gateways, traffic disruption may occur. After rebalancing the VNets, you can view the revised mapping of VNETs to cloud gateways on the tagging page.

Note
You cannot rebalance VNets when:
Create, edit, or delete of Cloud gateway is in progress.
Mapping of VNets is in progress.
Audit is in progress.
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Cloud OnRamp for Multicloud.
In Intent Management workflow, click Rebalance VNETS (Azure/GovCloud)
In the Cloud Provider field, choose Microsoft Azure.
In the Region field, choose an Azure region from the drop-down list.
In the Tag Name field, choose a tag from the drop-down list.
Click Rebalance.

Before You Begin
Configure integration of your Azure Virtual WAN hub with Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN. For information about this, see Azure Virtual WAN Hub Integration with Cisco SD-WAN.
Configure a firewall in the Azure environment, including the desired firewall policy.
Route Local Outgoing Traffic Flow to an Azure Secured Virtual Hub
To configure a branch router to route outgoing internet traffic to an Azure secured virtual hub, perform these steps.
On the local branch router, verify that the branch router does not have a static default route configured for direct internet access (DIA) from the branch.
On the local branch router, use the show ip route vrf vrf-number command to verify that the static default route is not configured for the service side VPN.
On the local branch router, use the show ip route vrf vrf-number command to verify that internet traffic from the local branch router has been routed to the Azure firewall using the VRF that you have configured for communication between the local branch router and Azure. In the command output, look for the IP addresses associated with the default route, which is represented as 0.0.0.0. The IP addresses must correspond to the cloud gateways operating in the Azure hub where the Azure firewall is enabled.
The following example uses VRF 100. In the example, only a portion of the command output is shown. The IP addresses that correspond to the cloud gateways operating in the Azure hub are 209.165.201.1 and 209.165.201.2.
Device# show ip route vrf 100

...
m*    0.0.0.0/0 [251/0] via 209.165.201.1, 21:06:00, Sdwan-system-intf
                [251/0] via 209.165.201.2, 21:06:00, Sdwan-system-intf
...
In the Azure environment, configure internet traffic to be routed through the Azure firewall.

Before You Begin
Configure integration of your Azure Virtual WAN hub with Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN. For information about this, see Azure Virtual WAN Hub Integration with Cisco SD-WAN.
Configure a firewall on the local branch router, including the desired firewall policy.
Route Azure Outgoing Traffic Flow to a Local Branch Router
To configure Azure to route outgoing internet traffic to a local branch router firewall, perform these steps.
In Cisco SD-WAN Manager, use the CLI template for the local branch router to add the following commands to the configuration. This advertises the local router as the default route for the Azure environment, causing the Azure virtual network to route its outgoing internet traffic to the branch router. Note that 0.0.0.0 represents the default route.
address-family ipv4 vrf branch-router-vpn-id
   advertise connected
   advertise static
   advertise network 0.0.0.0/0
Only traffic in the specified VPN is directed to the branch router. For information about how VPNs map the connectivity between Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN and Azure, see How Virtual WAN Hub Integration Works.
The following example directs Azure traffic in VPN 100 to the branch router:
address-family ipv4 vrf 100
   advertise connected
   advertise static
   advertise network 0.0.0.0/0
In the Azure environment, verify that the traffic is routed to the local branch router. View the routing table and verify that the following appears:
Prefix: 0.0.0.0/0
