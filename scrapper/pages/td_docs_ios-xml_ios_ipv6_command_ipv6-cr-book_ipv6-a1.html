aaa accounting multicast default
To enable authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) accounting of IPv6 multicast services for billing or security purposes when you use RADIUS, use the aaa accounting multicast default command in global configuration mode. To disable AAA accounting for IPv6 multicast services, use the no form of this command.
aaa accounting multicast default [start-stop | stop-only] [broadcast] [method1] [method2] [method3] [method4]
no aaa accounting multicast default [start-stop | stop-only] [broadcast] [method1] [method2] [method3] [method4]
Syntax Description
start-stop
(Optional) Sends a "start" accounting notice at the beginning of a process and a "stop" accounting notice at the end of a process. The "start" accounting record is sent in the background. The requested user process begins regardless of whether the "start" accounting notice was received by the accounting server.
stop-only
(Optional) Sends a "stop" accounting notice at the end of the requested user process.
broadcast
(Optional) Enables sending accounting records to multiple AAA servers. Simultaneously sends accounting records to the first server in each group. If the first server is unavailable, failover occurs using the backup servers defined within that group.
method1 , method2 , method3 , method4
(Optional) Method lists that specify an accounting method or multiple accounting methods to be used for accounting.
Command Default
AAA accounting for multicast is not enabled.

Usage Guidelines

Note
Including information about IPv6 addresses in accounting and authorization records transmitted between the router and the RADIUS or TACACS+ server is supported. However, there is no support for using IPv6 to communicate with that server. The server must have an IPv4 address.
Use the aaa accounting multicast default command to enable AAA accounting for multicast. The network access server reports user activity to the RADIUS security server in the form of accounting records. Each accounting record contains accounting attribute-value (AV) pairs and is stored on the security server.
Method lists for accounting define the way accounting will be performed. Named accounting method lists enable you to designate a particular security protocol to be used on specific lines or interfaces for particular types of accounting services. When using the aaa accounting multicast default command, you have the option of choosing one or all four existing named access lists, each of which specifies a RADIUS host or server group.
If the aaa accounting multicast default command for a particular accounting type is issued without a named method list specified, the default method list is automatically applied to all interfaces or lines (where this accounting type applies) except those that have a named method list explicitly defined. (A defined method list overrides the default method list.) If no default method list is defined, then no accounting takes place.
For minimal accounting, include the stop-only keyword to send a "stop" record accounting notice at the end of the requested user process. For more accounting, you can include the start-stop keyword, so that RADIUS sends a "start" accounting notice at the beginning of the requested process and a "stop" accounting notice at the end of the process. Accounting is stored only on the RADIUS.
When AAA accounting is activated, the network access server monitors RADIUS accounting attributes pertinent to the connection. The network access server reports these attributes as accounting records, which are then stored in an accounting log on the security server. For a list of supported RADIUS accounting attributes, refer to the appendix "RADIUS Attributes" in the CiscoIOS Security Configuration Guide .
Examples
The following example enables AAA accounting of IPv6 multicast services for billing or security purposes when RADIUS is used:
Router(config)# aaa accounting multicast default

Usage Guidelines

Note
Including information about IPv6 addresses in accounting and authorization records transmitted between the router and the RADIUS or TACACS+ server is supported. However, there is no support for using IPv6 to communicate with that server. The server must have an IPv4 address.
Use the aaa authorization multicast default command to enable authorization. Method lists for authorization define the ways authorization will be performed and the sequence in which these methods will be performed. A method list is a named list describing the authorization methods to be used, in sequence. Method lists enable you to designate one or more security protocols to be used for authorization, thus ensuring a backup system in case the initial method fails. Cisco IOS IPv6 software uses the first method listed to authorize users for specific network services; if that method fails to respond, the Cisco IOS IPv6 software selects the next method listed in the method list. This process continues until there is successful communication with a listed authorization method, or all methods defined are exhausted.

Note
The Cisco IOS IPv6 software attempts authorization with the next listed method only when there is no response from the previous method. If authorization fails at any point in this cycle--meaning that the security server or local username database responds by denying the user services--the authorization process stops, and no other authorization methods are attempted.
If the aaa authorization multicast default command for a particular authorization type is issued without a named method list specified, the default method list is automatically applied to all lines or interfaces (where this authorization type applies) except those that have a named method list explicitly defined. (A defined method list overrides the default method list.) If no default method list is defined, then no authorization takes place.

Note
In the table below, the group radius and group group-name methods refer to a set of previously defined RADIUS servers. Use the radius-server host command to configure the host servers. Use the aaa group server radius command to create a named group of servers.
Method keywords are described in the table below.
Table 1. aaa authorization Methods
Keyword
Description
group radius
Uses the list of all RADIUS servers for authentication as defined by the aaa group server radius command.
group group-name
Uses a subset of RADIUS servers for accounting as defined by the server group group-name command.
if-authenticated
Allows the user to access the requested function if the user is authenticated.
local
Uses the local database for authorization.
none
No authorization is performed.
Cisco IOS IPv6 software supports the following methods for authorization:
RADIUS--The network access server requests authorization information from the RADIUS security server group. RADIUS authorization defines specific rights for users by associating attributes, which are stored in a database on the RADIUS server, with the appropriate user.
If-Authenticated--The user is allowed to access the requested function provided the user has been authenticated successfully.
None--The network access server does not request authorization information; authorization is not performed over this line or interface.
Local--The router or access server consults its local database, as defined by the username command, to authorize specific rights for users. Only a limited set of functions can be controlled via the local database.
Method lists are specific to the type of authorization being requested. AAA supports the following different types of authorization:
Network--Applies to network connections. This can include a PPP, Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP), or AppleTalk Remote Access (ARA) connection.
EXEC--Applies to the attributes associated with a user EXEC terminal session.
Commands--Applies to the EXEC mode commands and user issues. Command authorization attempts authorization for all EXEC mode commands, including global configuration commands, associated with a specific privilege level.
Reverse Access--Applies to reverse Telnet sessions.
Configuration--Applies to the configuration downloaded from the AAA server.
The authorization command causes a request packet containing a series of AV pairs to be sent to the RADIUS daemon as part of the authorization process. The daemon can do one of the following:
Accept the request as is.
Make changes to the request.
Refuse the request and refuse authorization.
For a list of supported RADIUS attributes, refer to the appendix "RADIUS Attributes" in the CiscoIOS Security Configuration Guide .
Examples
The following example enables AAA authorization and sets default parameters that restrict user access to an IPv6 multicast network:
Router(config)# aaa authorization multicast default

12.2(50)SY
This command was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 12.2(50)SY.
Usage Guidelines
The accounting command allows users to configure and send accounting start and stop messages to a named accounting list. When accounting is configured for a DHCPv6 pool, accounting interim packets are sent to broadband sessions after binding is provided from the pool.
Examples
The following example configures accounting start and stop messages to be sent to an accounting list called list1:
Router(config)# ipv6 dhcp pool pool1
Router(config-dhcp)# accounting list1
address (Mobile IPv6)
To specify the home address of the IPv6 mobile node, use the address command in home-agent configuration mode or IPv6 mobile router host configuration mode. To remove a host configuration, use the no form of this command.
address {ipv6-address | autoconfig}
no address
Syntax Description
ipv6-address
Specifies a home address for the mobile node.
This argument must be in the form documented in RFC 2373 where the address is specified in hexadecimal using 16-bit values between colons.
autoconfig
Allows any IPv6 address to be used.
Command Default
No home address is specified for the mobile router.
Command Modes

Home-agent configuration (config-ha)
IPv6 mobile router host configuration
Command History
Release
Modification
12.4(11)T
This command was introduced.
12.4(20)T
IPv6 network mobility (NEMO) functionality was added.
Usage Guidelines
The address command in IPv6 home-agent configuration mode specifies the home address of the mobile node. The ipv6-address argument can be used to configure a specific IPv6 address, or the autoconfig keyword can be used to allow any IPv6 address as the home address of the IPv6 mobile node.
Do not configure two separate groups with the same IPv6 address. For example, host group group1 and host group group2 cannot both have the same home address of baba::1.
When the address command is configured with a specific IPv6 address, the nai command, which configures the network address identifier (NAI), cannot be configured using the @realm argument. For example, the following nai command configuration would not be valid because the address command is configured with the specific address baba::1:
host group engineering
  nai  @cisco.com
  address baba::1
Examples
In the following example, the user enters home agent configuration mode, creates a host group named group1, and configures any IPv6 address to be used for the mobile node:
Router(config)# ipv6 mobile home-agent
Router(config-ha)# host group group1
Router(config-ha)# address autoconfig

Usage Guidelines
The address-family ipv6 command places the router in address family configuration mode (prompt: config-router-af), from which you can configure routing sessions that use standard IPv6 address prefixes.
The BGP commands supported in address family configuration mode configure the same functionality as the BGP commands supported in router configuration mode; however, the BGP commands in router configuration mode configure functionality only for the IPv4 unicast address prefix. To configure BGP commands and functionality for other address family prefixes (for example, the IPv4 multicast or IPv6 unicast address prefixes), you must enter address family configuration mode for those address prefixes using the address-family ipv4 command or the address-family ipv6 command.
Use the multicast keyword to specify an administrative distance for multicast BGP routes to be used in reverse path forwarding (RPF) lookups.
Examples
The following example places the router in address family configuration mode and specifies unicast address prefixes for the IPv6 address family:
Router(config)# router bgp 100
Router(config-router)# address-family ipv6 unicast
Router(config-router-af)#
The following example places the router in address family configuration mode and specifies multicast address prefixes for the IPv6 address family:

Usage Guidelines
IS-IS performs consistency checks on hello packets and will form an adjacency only with a neighboring router that supports the same set of protocols. A router running IS-IS for both IPv4 and IPv6 will not form an adjacency with a router running IS-IS for IPv4 only.
Use the no adjacency-check command in address-family configuration mode to suppress the consistency checks for IPv6 IS-IS and allow an IPv4 IS-IS router to form an adjacency with a router running IPv4 IS-IS and IPv6. IS-IS will never form an adjacency between a router running IPv4 IS-IS only and a router running IPv6 only.
Use the no adjacency-check command in router configuration mode to suppress the IPv4 subnet consistency check and allow IS-IS to form an adjacency with other routers regardless of whether or not they have an IPv4 subnet in common. By default, IS-IS makes checks in hello packets for IPv4 address subnet matching with a neighbor. In multitopology mode, the IPv4 subnet consistency check is automatically suppressed.

Tip
Use the debug isis adjacency packets command in privileged EXEC mode to check for adjacency errors. Error messages in the output may indicate where routers are failing to establish adjacencies.
Examples
In the following example, the network administrator wants to introduce IPv6 into an existing IPv4 IS-IS network. To ensure that the checking of hello packet checks from adjacent neighbors is disabled until all the neighbor routers are configured to use IPv6, the network administrator enters the no adjacency-check command.
Router(config)# router isis
Router(config-router)# address-family ipv6
Router(config-router-af)# no adjacency-check
In IPv4, the following example shows that the network administrator wants to introduce IPv6 into an existing IPv4 IS-IS network. To ensure that the checking of hello packet checks from adjacent neighbors is disabled until all the neighbor routers are configured to use IPv6, the network administrator enters the no adjacency-check command.
Router(config)# router isis
Router(config-router-af)# no adjacency-check
advertise passive-only (IPv6)
To configure Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) to advertise only IPv6 prefixes that belong to passive interfaces, use the advertise passive-only command in address family configuration mode. To remove the restriction, use the no form of this command.

Cisco IOS XE Release 3.6S
This command was introduced.
15.2(4)M
This command was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)M.
Usage Guidelines
This command is an IS-IS mechanism to exclude IPv6 prefixes of connected networks from link-state packet (LSP) advertisements, thereby reducing IS-IS convergence time.
Configuring this command per IS-IS instance is a scalable method to reduce IS-IS convergence time because fewer IPv6 prefixes will be advertised in the router nonpseudonode LSP.
This command relies on the fact that when enabling IS-IS on a loopback interface, you usually configure the loopback as passive (to prevent sending unnecessary hello packets out through it because there is no chance of finding a neighbor behind it). Thus, if you want to advertise only the loopback and if it has already been configured as passive, configuring the advertise passive-only command per IS-IS instance prevents overpopulation of the routing tables.
An alternative to this command is the no isis advertise-prefix command, which is a small-scale method because it is configured per interface.
Examples
The following example uses the advertise passive-only command, which affects the IS-IS instance, and thereby prevents advertising the IPv6 network of Gigabit Ethernet interface 0/0/0. Only the IPv6 address of loopback interface 0 is advertised.

15.0(2)SE
This command was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 15.0(2)SE.
Usage Guidelines
Ensure that the same policy (the SPI and the key) is configured on all of the interfaces on the link. SPI values may be automatically used by other client applications, such as tunnels.
The policy database is common to all client applications on a device. This means that two IPsec clients, such as OSPF and a tunnel, cannot use the same SPI. Additionally, an SPI can only be used in one policy.
Beginning with Cisco IOS Release 12.4(4)T, the sha-1 keyword can be used to choose SHA-1 authentication instead of entering the md5 keyword to use MD5 authentication. The SHA-1 algorithm is considered to be somewhat more secure than the MD5 algorithm, and it requires a 40-hexadecimal-digit (20-byte) key rather than the 32-hexadecimal-digit (16-byte) key that is required for MD5 authentication.
Examples
The following example shows how to enable authentication for the OSPF area 1:
Router(config)# ipv6 router ospf 1
Router(config-router)# area 1 authentication ipsec spi 678 md5 1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF

Cisco IOS XE Release 2.1
This command was introduced on Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers.
Usage Guidelines
The area range command is used only with Area Border Routers (ABRs). It is used to consolidate or summarize routes for an area. The result is that a single summary route is advertised to other areas by the ABR. Routing information is condensed at area boundaries. External to the area, a single route is advertised for each address range. This behavior is called route summarization
Multiple area router configuration commands specifying the range option can be configured. Thus, OSPF can summarize addresses for many different sets of address ranges.
This command has been modified for Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) for IPv6. Users can now enter the IPv6 address syntax.

Note
To remove the specified area from the software configuration, use the no area area-id command (with no other keywords). That is, the no area area-id command removes all area options, such as area default-cost , area nssa , area range , area stub , and area virtual-link .
Examples
The following example specifies one summary route to be advertised by the ABR to other areas for all subnets on network 10.0.0.0 and for all hosts on network 192.168.110.0:
interface Ethernet0/0

12.4(20)T
IPv6 network mobility (NEMO) functionality was added.
Usage Guidelines
The authentication command provides mobility message authentication by creating a mobility SPI, a key, an authentication algorithm, and a replay protection mechanism. Mobility message authentication option is used to authenticate binding update (BU) and binding acknowledgment (BA) messages based on the shared-key-based security association between the mobile node and the home agent.
The mobile node or home agent receiving this BU must verify the authentication data in the option. If authentication fails, the home agent must send a FAIL message. If the home agent does not have shared-key-based mobility SA, the home agent MUST discard the BU.
The mobility message replay protection option may be used in BU or BA messages when authenticated using the mobility message authentication option. The mobility message replay protection option, configured using the replay within keywords, is used to let the home agent verify that a BU has been freshly generated by the mobile node and not replayed by an attacker from some previous BU. This function is especially useful for cases in which the home agent does not maintain stateful information about the mobile node after the binding entry has been removed. The home agent performs the replay protection check after the BU has been authenticated. The mobility message replay protection option, when included, is used by the mobile node for matching the BA with the BU.
Examples
The following example shows a unidirectional SPI and a key:
authentication spi 500 key ascii cisco

Usage Guidelines
The OSPF for IPv6 metric is calculated as the Mbps value divided by the bandwidth, with Mbps equal to 108 by default, and bandwidth determined by the bandwidth (interface) command. The calculation gives Fast Ethernet a metric of 1.
If you have multiple links with high bandwidth (such as Fast Ethernet or ATM), you might want to use a larger number to differentiate the cost on those links.
Using this formula, the default path costs were calculated as noted in the following bulleted list. If these values do not suit your network, you can use your own method of calculating path costs.
56-kbps serial link--Default cost is 1785.
64-kbps serial link--Default cost is 1562.
T1 (1.544-Mbps serial link)--Default cost is 64.

For link protection, BGP automatically restricts the recursion for the next hop resolution of connected routes. These routes are provided by the route reflector, which receives the prefix from another provider edge (PE) router that needs the customer edge (CE) router to be protected.
For node protection, BGP automatically restricts the recursion for the next hop resolution of host routes. These routes are provided by the route reflector, which receives the prefix from the host PE router. If a PE router or Autonomous System Boundary Router (ASBR) fails, for the bgp recursion host command to work, the PE routers must satisfy the following options:
The host prefix must be used on the PE loopback interfaces.
The next-hop-self must be configured on iBGP sessions.
The recursive via host prefix command must be configured.
To enable Cisco Express Forwarding to use strict recursion rules for an IPv4 address family, you must configure the bgp recursion host command that enables the recursive-via-host flag when PIC is enabled.
The recursive-via-connected flag is set for directly connected peers only. For example, if the bgp additional-paths install command is configured in IPv4 and IPv4 VRF address family configuration modes, the running configuration shows the following details:
address-family ipv4
bgp additional-paths-install
no bgp recursion host
!
address-family ipv4 vrf red
bgp additional-paths-install
bgp recursion host
In the case of an external Border Gateway Protocol (eBGP) directly connected peers route exchange, the recursion is disabled for the connected routes. The recursive-via-connected flag is automatically set in the RIB and Cisco Express Forwarding for the routes from the eBGP single-hop peers.
For all the VPNs, irrespective of whether PIC is enabled, when the bgp recursion host command is configured in VPNv4 and IPv4 address family configuration modes, the normal recursion rules are disabled and only recursion via host-specific routes is allowed for primary, backup, and multipaths under those address families. To enable the normal recursion rules, configure the no bgp recursion host command in VPNv4 and IPv4 address family configuration modes.

binding
To configure binding options for the Mobile IPv6 home agent feature, use the binding command in home agent configuration mode. To restore parameters to default values, use the no form of this command.
binding [access access-list-name | auth-option | seconds | maximum | refresh]
no binding [access access-list-name | auth-option | seconds | maximum | refresh]
Syntax Description
access
(Optional) Specifies an access list to limit response.
access-list-name
(Optional) Access control list used to configure a binding update filter. When an access control list is configured, all Dynamic Home Agent Address Discovery (DHAAD) requests and binding updates are filtered by the home address and destination address.
auth-option
(Optional) Valid authentication option, which authenticates the binding update and binding acknowledgment messages based on the shared-key-based security association between the mobile node and the home agent.
seconds
(Optional) Permissible maximum binding lifetime, in number of seconds. The lifetime granted in the binding acknowledgment (binding ack) parameter is always the smallest of the requested lifetime, subnet lifetime, and configured permissible lifetime parameters.
maximum
(Optional) Maximum number of binding cache entries. If the value is set to 0, no new binding requests are accepted. Existing bindings are allowed to expire gracefully.
refresh
(Optional) Suggested binding refresh interval, in number of seconds. If the registration lifetime is greater than the configured binding refresh interval, this value is returned to the mobile node in the binding refresh advice option in the binding ack sent by the home agent.
Command Default
No access list is used to configure a binding update filter. The default value for the seconds argument is 262140, which is the maximum permissible binding time. The default value for the maximum argument is a number of entries limited by memory available on the router. The default value of the refresh argument is 300 sec.

Usage Guidelines
Before you enable the ipv6 mobile home-agent command on an interface, you should configure common parameters on the router using the binding command. This command does not enable home agent service on the interfaces.
If the configured number of home agent registrations is reached or exceeded, subsequent registrations will be refused with the error "Insufficient resources." No existing bindings will discarded until their lifetime has expired, even if the maximum argument is set to a value lower than the current number of such bindings.
The appropriate value for the refresh argument will depend on whether the router is operating any high-availability features. If it is not, and a failure would cause the bindings cache to be lost, set the refresh argument to a low value.
Examples
In the following example, the maximum number of binding cache entries is set to 15:
binding 15

Usage Guidelines
The clear bgp ipv6 command is similar to the clear ip bgp command, except that it is IPv6-specific.
Use of the clear bgp ipv6 command allows a reset of the neighbor sessions with varying degrees of severity depending on the specified keywords and arguments.
Use the clear bgp ipv6 unicast command to drop neighbor sessions with IPv6 unicast address prefixes.
The unicast keyword is available in Cisco IOS Release 12.3(2)T and later releases. It is not available in releases prior to 12.3(2)T. Use of the unicast keyword is mandatory starting with Cisco IOS Release 12.3(2)T.
The multicast keyword is available in Cisco IOS Release 12.0(26)S and later releases. It is not available in releases prior to 12.0(26)S. Use of either the unicast or multicast keyword is mandatory starting with Cisco IOS Release 12.0(26)S.
Use the clear bgp ipv6 * command to drop all neighbor sessions. The Cisco IOS software will then reset the neighbor connections. Use this form of the command in the following situations:
BGP timer specification change
BGP administrative distance changes
Use t he clear bgp ipv6 soft out or the clear bgp ipv6 unicast soft out command to drop only the outbound neighbor connections. Inbound neighbor sessions will not be reset. Use this form of the command in the following situations:
BGP-related access lists change or get additions
BGP-related weights change
BGP-related distribution lists change
BGP-related route maps change
Use the clear bgp ipv6 soft in or the clear bgp ipv6 unicast soft in command to drop only the inbound neighbor connections. Outbound neighbor sessions will not be reset. To reset inbound routing table updates dynamically for a neighbor, you must configure the neighbor to support the router refresh capability. To determine whether a BGP neighbor supports this capability, use the show bgp ipv6 neighbors or the show bgp ipv6 unicast neighbors command. If a neighbor supports the route refresh capability, the following message is displayed:
Received route refresh capability from peer.
If all BGP networking devices support the route refresh capability, use the clear bgp ipv6 {* | ip-address | ipv6-address | peer-group-name } in or the clear bgp ipv6 unicast {* | ip-address | ipv6-address | peer-group-name } in command. Use of the soft keyword is not required when the route refresh capability is supported by all BGP networking devices, because the software automatically performs a soft reset.
Use this form of the command in the following situations:
BGP-related access lists change or get additions
BGP-related weights change
BGP-related distribution lists change
BGP-related route maps change

15.3(3)M
This command was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 15.3(3)M.
Usage Guidelines
The clear ipv6 dhcp binding command is used as a server function.
A binding table entry on the DHCP for IPv6 server is automatically:
Created whenever a prefix is delegated to a client from the configuration pool.
Updated when the client renews, rebinds, or confirms the prefix delegation.
Deleted when the client releases all the prefixes in the binding voluntarily, all prefixes’ valid lifetimes have expired, or an administrator runs the clear ipv6 dhcp binding command.
If the clear ipv6 dhcp binding command is used with the optional ipv6-address argument specified, only the binding for the specified client is deleted. If the clear ipv6 dhcp binding command is used without the ipv6-address argument, then all automatic client bindings are deleted from the DHCP for IPv6 binding table. If the optional vrf vrf-name keyword and argument combination is used, only the bindings for the specified VRF are cleared.
Examples
The following example deletes all automatic client bindings from the DHCP for IPv6 server binding table:
Router# clear ipv6 dhcp binding

When you configure the DHCPv6 server to detect conflicts, it uses ping. The client uses neighbor discovery to detect clients and reports to the server through a DECLINE message. If an address conflict is detected, the address is removed from the pool, and the address is not assigned until the administrator removes the address from the conflict list.
If you use the asterisk (*) character as the address parameter, DHCP clears all conflicts.
If the vrf vrf-name keyword and argument are specified, only the address conflicts that belong to the specified VRF will be cleared.
Examples
The following example shows how to clear all address conflicts from the DHCPv6 server database:
Router# clear ipv6 dhcp conflict *
