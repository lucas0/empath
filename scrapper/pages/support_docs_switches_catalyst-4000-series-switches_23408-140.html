Introduction
This document offers a sample configuration and command structure for the setup of an EtherChannel link that is a trunk link between a Catalyst Layer 2 (L2) fixed configuration switch, which includes the 2950/2955/2970/2940/2900XL/3500XL switches, and a Catalyst 4500/4000 switch that runs Catalyst OS (CatOS). You can configure the Catalyst L2 fixed configuration switch with any Catalyst 4500/4000, 5500/5000, or 6500/6000 series switch that runs CatOS in this scenario to obtain the same results. With the popularity of Fast Ethernet in current networks, the sample configuration uses Fast Ethernet. The sample bundles two Fast Ethernet ports from each of the switches into a Fast EtherChannel (FEC) and configures IEEE 802.1Q (dot1q) trunking on top of the FEC.

Background Theory
When you use a Catalyst L2 fixed configuration switch and any Catalyst 4500/4000 family product that runs CatOS (Catalyst 4003/4006/2948G/2980G), keep in mind that the switches only support dot1q trunking encapsulation. Other Catalyst platforms support both dot1q and Inter-Switch Link Protocol (ISL). While dot1q is an IEEE standard, ISL is proprietary to Cisco. Only Cisco hardware can support ISL trunking encapsulation. If you use other Cisco switching platforms, such as the Catalyst 5500/5000 or Catalyst 6500/6000, and need to determine which trunking method has support, issue this command:
show port capabilities mod/port
For more information on a specific port and what capabilities the specific port has (such as dot1q, ISL, and port channel), refer to:
show port capabilities
Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) and Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP)
EtherChannels have automatic configuration with either Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) or Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP). You can also configure EtherChannels manually. PAgP is a Cisco-proprietary protocol that you can only run on Cisco switches and on those switches that licensed vendors license to support PAgP. IEEE 802.3ad defines LACP. LACP allows Cisco switches to manage Ethernet channels between switches that conform to the 802.3ad protocol. You can configure up to 16 ports to form a channel. Eight of the ports are in active mode and the other eight are in standby mode. When any of the active ports fail, a standby port becomes active. Standby mode works only for LACP, not for PAgP.
If you use one of these protocols, a switch learns the identity of partners able to support either PAgP or LACP and learns the capabilities of each interface. The switch then dynamically groups interfaces with similar configurations into a single logical link (channel or aggregate port); the switch bases these interface groups on hardware, administrative, and port parameter constraints. For example, PAgP groups the interfaces with the same speed, duplex mode, native VLAN, VLAN range, and trunking status and type. After PAgP groups the links into an EtherChannel, PAgP adds the group to the spanning tree as a single switch port.

PAgP and LACP Modes
This section lists the user-configurable EtherChannel modes for the channel-group interface configuration command. Switch interfaces exchange PAgP packets only with partner interfaces with the auto or desirable mode configuration. Switch interfaces exchange LACP packets only with partner interfaces with the active or passive mode configuration. Interfaces with the on mode configuration do not exchange PAgP or LACP packets.
active—Places an interface into an active negotiation state, in which the interface starts negotiations with other interfaces through the send of LACP packets.
auto—Places an interface into a passive negotiation state, in which the interface responds to PAgP packets that the interface receives but does not start PAgP packet negotiation. This setting minimizes the transmission of PAgP packets.
desirable—Places an interface into an active negotiation state, in which the interface starts negotiations with other interfaces through the send of PAgP packets.
on—Forces the interface into an EtherChannel without PAgP or LACP. With the on mode, a usable EtherChannel exists only when an interface group in the on mode has a connection to another interface group in the on mode.
passive—Places an interface into a passive negotiation state, in which the interface responds to LACP packets that the interface receives, but does not start LACP packet negotiation. This setting minimizes the transmission of LACP packets.
There are only three valid combinations to run the LACP link aggregate, as this table shows:
Switch Switch Comments
active active Recommended.
active passive Link aggregation occurs if negotiation is successful.
on on Link aggregation occurs without LACP. Although this works, this combination is not recommended.
Note: By default, with the configuration of an LACP channel, the LACP channel mode is passive.
PAgP Restrictions
PAgP aids in the automatic creation of FEC links. PAgP packets transmit between FEC-capable ports to negotiate the formation of a channel. Some restrictions have been deliberately introduced into PAgP. The restrictions are:
PAgP does not form a bundle on ports with configuration for dynamic VLANs. PAgP requires that all ports in the channel belong to the same VLAN or that the ports have trunk port configurations. When a bundle already exists and you modify the VLAN of a port, all ports in the bundle change to match that VLAN.
PAgP does not group ports that operate at different speeds or port duplex. If you change speed and duplex when a bundle exists, PAgP changes the port speed and duplex for all ports in the bundle.
PAgP modes are off, auto, desirable, and on. Only the combinations auto-desirable, desirable-desirable, and on-on allow the formation of a channel. If a device on one side of the channel does not support PAgP, such as a router, the device on the other side must have PAgP set to on. Catalyst 2950 switches support PAgP for channel negotiation with Cisco IOS Software Release 12.1(6)EA2 or later. Cisco IOS Software Release 12.0 supports only static configuration. All Catalyst switches that run CatOS support PAgP protocol channel negotiation.
Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP)
There are different types of trunking protocols. If a port can become a trunk, it may also have the ability to trunk automatically. In some cases, the port may even be able to negotiate what type of trunking to use on the port. This ability to negotiate the trunking method with the other device has the name Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP).
Catalyst 2950 switches support DTP for dynamic trunking with Cisco IOS Software Release 12.1(6)EA2 or later. Cisco IOS Software Release 12.0 supports only static configuration. All Catalyst switches that run CatOS support DTP.

!--- By default, all ports on a Catalyst 4500/4000 use channel protocol PAgP. !--- So, to run LACP, you must change the channel protocol to LACP. On switches !--- that run CatOS, you can only change the channel mode per module. In this !--- example, the command set channelprotocol lacp module_number !--- changes the channel mode for slot 2. Use the show channelprotocol command to !--- verify the changes.

Cat4003 (enable)


!--- There is a parameter exchange in the LACP packet. The parameter is !--- the admin key. A channel can only form between ports that have !--- the same admin key. In this example, both ports have assignment to the same group. !--- (The random assignment is admin key 80.) !--- Keep in mind that the admin key is only locally significant. In other words, !--- the admin key must be the same only for ports within the switch and is not a factor !--- between different switches.


Cat4003 (enable) set port lacp-channel 2/1-2 mode active
Port(s) 2/1-2 channel mode set to active.

To form the channel change the LACP channel mode

!--- Configure the ports to the desirable trunk mode that makes the ports actively !--- attempt to convert the link to a trunk link. The ports become trunk ports if !--- the neighbor ports are in on, desirable, or auto mode.
