Control Attenuation to Improve Performance
Line Equalizers from Scientific Atlanta, a Cisco company, are passive devices that correct for excess down tilt caused by cable attenuation in the subscriber network. Their rugged, powder-coated aluminum-alloy housing provides reliable performance in the most challenging environments. And the circuitry permits equalization of the forward band while simultaneously passing the reverse band with no equalization. Different models of the 750 MHz line equalizer provide either fixed value equalization or variable equalization that permits better control over tap output levels as determined by the system design.
Scientific Atlanta's extensive reverse path research has conclusively determined that strategic reverse path signal attenuation enables systems to better support transmission. With that in mind, Multimedia Line Equalizer/Reverse Conditioners in the series provide attenuation in the reverse path, as well as well as forward band. This increases overall signal-to-noise performance, simplifies deployment of new services and minimizes concerns about overdriving optical return transmitter lasers.
With greater percentages of devices such as high speed data and telephony modems transmitting in the upper end of their RF transmit range, these devices can provide significant improvements in carrier-to-ingress and carrier-to-noise performance.
