Note
The number of days the data can be stored in Cisco vManage, depends on per-day processing volume of the device nodes. To store the data for a longer time or to accommodate the increase in per-day processing volume, use the following formulas to calculate the required Cisco vManage disk size:
Formula to calculate the Cisco vManage disk size required for single node deployment: (Data per day × number of days) + 500 GB buffer . For example, if the data per day is 100 Gigabytes and the number of days the data must be stored is 10, then the required Cisco vManage disk size is 1.5 Terabytes.
Formula to calculate the Cisco vManage disk size required for cluster deployment: (Data per day × number of days × 3) + 500 GB buffer . For example, if the data per day is 100 Gigabytes, the number of days the data must be stored is 10, then the required Cisco vManage disk size is 3.5 Terabytes.
