CSCvk59357 Admin warned of license non-compliance even after adding new licenses
Problem Description
When Smart Licensing is used, Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) continues to display a license warning message for up to 60 days after resolution of a license shortage.
Background
With Smart Licensing, ISE requests licenses with a Smart Licensing account from a pool of licenses. ISE is not aware of the size of the pool. In order for the ISE administrator to have sufficient time to add licenses before enforcement takes place, ISE warns the administrator of non-compliance 60 days prior to enforcement. Enforcement removes features from the GUI. After licenses are added to the pool, it can take up to 60 days for the non-compliance information to be purged from the system as compliance is tracked daily.
Problem Symptom
The warning has no functional impact to the ISE system. It is solely a message to notify the administrator who logs into the GUI that ISE has exceeded license usage at least once in the last 60 days.
Workaround/Solution
To receive a clarified version of the warning message, please upgrade the ISE system software to one of these versions:
ISE Release 2.2 - Patch 13 or later
ISE Release 2.3 - Patch 6 or later
ISE Release 2.4 - Patch 6 or later
ISE Release 2.6 or later
The goal of the clarified warning message is to give the administrator enough time to purchase additional licenses before features are removed from the GUI.
In order to verify that ISE is compliant, the license status can be viewed from Administration > System > Licensing > Usage Over Time. Additionally, when you log into the GUI, the license alert will begin to incrementally count up in days from one day to the next. An example of the updated warning message is shown here:
