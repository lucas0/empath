Dial-on-Demand Routing (DDR)
Dial-On-Demand Routing (DDR) is a technique whereby a router can automatically initiate and close a circuit-switched session as transmitting stations demand. The router spoofs keepalives so that end stations treat the session as active. DDR permits routing over ISDN or telephone Read more
