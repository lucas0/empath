Network Convergence System 1000 Series
NCS 1010 Optical Line System
Optical transport networks are evolving to address an exponential increase in network traffic faced by Service Providers. There is a growing need to support both digital coherent optics and high-performance transponders. This release introduces a new generation of Optical Line System (OLS), NCS 1010.
NCS 1010 OLS platform is an integral component of Routed Optical Networking solution. It provides point-to-point connectivity between routers with ZR/ZR+ optics and multiplexes signals from multiple routers over a single fiber. The OLS platform supports ROADM nodes of up to eight degrees using the NCS 1000 Breakout Patch Panel. NCS 1010 supports C-band WDM transmission in this release.
The NCS 1010 OLS platform provides::
Versatility by supporting multiple coherent sources such as:
400G digital coherent ZR/ZR+ optics (-10dBm output power)
High-performance DCO transponders such as 1.2T and 2-QDD-C cards that use high GBaud rates.
Simplicity by using integrated Optical line cards that minimize fiber patching and cabling errors in the field.
Automation through IOS XR operating system that provides a rich suite of automation features including Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP), open config YANG model support with NETCONF, and streaming telemetry.
Network Monitoring through a combination of probes based on OTDR, OSC, OCM, and telemetry data.
The NCS 1010 OLS platform comprises of:
Network Convergence System (NCS 1010) chassis
Cisco NCS 1000 Breakout Patch Panel
Cisco NCS 1000 32-Channel Mux/Demux Patch Panels
NCS 1010 Chassis
Cisco NCS 1010 is a 3RU modular chassis that has an in-built External Interface Timing Unit (EITU) and multiple field-replaceable modules.
NCS 1010 supports five different variants of the line card:
OLT-C Line Card: C-band Optical Line Terminal without Raman
OLT-R-C Line Card: C-band Optical Line Terminal with Raman
ILA-C Line Card: C-band In-Line Amplifier without Raman
ILA-R-C Line Card: C-band In-Line Amplifier with one side Raman
ILA-2R-C Line Card: C-band In-Line Amplifier with both sides Raman
For more information about the NCS 1010 chassis, see the data sheet.
Cisco NCS 1000 Breakout Patch Panel
It is a colorless breakout patch panel that enables you to implement long-haul topologies. These topologies use high TX power transponders such as the 1.2T or 2-QDD-C line card.
Cisco NCS 1000 breakout patch panel supports up to 72 Mux/Demux channels and eight ROADM degrees using the following breakout modules:
NCS1K-BRK-8 (used as Express interconnect)
NCS1K-BRK-24 (used for colorless topology)
For more information about the NCS 1000 breakout patch panel, see the data sheet.
Cisco NCS 1000 32-Channel Mux/Demux Patch Panels
These patch panels support colored channels that enables you to implement metro topologies. These topologies use low TX power modules such as 400G ZR/ZR+ coherent optics. This patch panel also supports the Routed Optical Networking solution.
The two Mux/Demux patch panels (NCS1K-MD-32O-C and NCS1K-MD32E-C) support 32 channels and work as an add/drop unit for the OLT-C and OLT-R-C line cards.
For more information about the NCS 1000 Mux/Demux patch panels, see the data sheet.

For more details, see Data Models Configuration Guide for Cisco NCS 1010.
What's New in Cisco NCS 1001 and NCS 1004, IOS XR Release 7.7.1
NCS 1004
Feature Description
Software
10x10G + 1x100G Hybrid Mode for OTN-XP Card
A new hybrid mode 10x10G + 1x100G over 200G trunk rate is introduced for OTN-XP card. This mode is configurable on both slice 1 and slice 0. This feature provides you the flexibility to choose a combination of 10G and 100G client rates simultaneously on both slices of the OTN-XP card.
Daisy Chain Support on Management Ports
In a daisy dhain arrangement, multiple NCS 1004 nodes across two sites are linearly connected to each other over the management ports. As a result, when the TOR switches at a site are down, the NCS 1004 nodes of that site are still reachable from the NCS 1004 nodes at the other site. You can daisy chain up to five NCS 1004 nodes in the network.
32G FC-MXP Mode Support on the OTN-XP Card
The OTN-XP card now supports 32G FC-MXP LC mode for Fiber Channel (FC) support, in addition to the 16G FC-MXP mode that was supported already. You can configure 32G FC with 400G trunk rate on slice 0.
FC Mode Support on DP04CFP2-M25-K9 Pluggable
The 16G FC and 32G FC muxponder modes support is added to the trunk pluggable DP04CFP2-M25-K9 on the OTN-XP card. This is in addition to the 4x100 muxponder and 400G-TXP modes that were supported previously.
PM History Persistence
PM history parameters for Optics, Ethernet, and coherent DSP controllers are now retained even after operation disruptive events like: Various reload procedures, Power cycle, and OS upgrade of the NCS 1004 chassis.This functionality maintains prolonged access to performance history that is useful for device health monitoring.
Data Models
OC Support for TXP and MXP Data Paths using ZRP
From this release onwards, in NCS1K4-OTN-XP line cards, you can configure the 2x100GE-MXP-DD, 3x100GE-MXP-DD, 4x100GE-MXP-DD, and 400GE-TXP-DD card modes using ZR+ pluggable via OpenConfig.
This enhancement improves efficiency, performance, and flexibility for customer networks allowing 2x100GE, 3x100GE, 400GE, and 4x100GE client transport over 400GE WDM wavelength.
Feature Description
Hardware
Attention LED
The attention LED is available on all ports of the NCS 1004 line cards. This LED can be selectively turned on for a specific QSFP port or simultaneously on all of the QSFP ports using the hw-module location command. When turned on, the LED flashes yellow. This LED flashing functionality helps field engineers quickly identify a specific port on the line card for troubleshooting, especially in a cluttered environment.
NCS1K4-QXP-K9 Line Card
NCS1K4-QXP-K9 line card delivers low cost 100G and 400G DWDM transmission with ZR+ optics on a router. This line card can be used in both traditional Optical Networking solution and in Routed Optical Networking solution. This line card has 16 pluggable ports with eight QSFP-DD client ports and eight QSFP-DD trunk ports. NCS1K4-QXP-K9 card supports the following key features:
Client rates: 400GE, 4x100GE, and 100GE Ethernet
Modulation formats: 16 QAM for 400GE Txp/4x100GE Mxp and QPSK for100GE Txp
Smart licensing: The license calculation is based on the number of trunk slices
provisioned.

Bug Search Tool
Cisco Bug Search Tool (BST) is a web-based tool that acts as a gateway to the Cisco bug tracking system that maintains a comprehensive list of defects and vulnerabilities in Cisco products and software. BST provides you with detailed defect information about your products and software.
Using Bug Search Tool
You can use the Cisco Bug Search Tool to search for a specific bug or to search for all bugs in a release.
Procedure
Step 1
Go to the http://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch.
Step 2
Log in using your registered Cisco.com username and password.
The Bug Search page opens.
Step 3
Use any of these options to search for bugs, and then press Enter (Return) to initiate the search:
To search for a specific bug, enter the bug ID in the Search For field.
To search for bugs based on specific criteria, enter search criteria, such as a problem description, a feature, or a product name, in the Search For field.
To search for bugs based on products, enter or select a product from the Product list. For example, if you enter “WAE,” you get several options from which to choose.
To search for bugs based on releases, in the Releases list select whether to search for bugs affecting a specific release, bugs that were fixed in a specific release, or both. Then enter one or more release numbers in the Releases field.
Step 4
When the search results are displayed, use the filter tools to narrow the results. You can filter the bugs by status, severity, and so on.
To export the results to a spreadsheet, click Export Results to Excel.
