Introduction
This document describes ways to install  ISE patches and FAQs during installation.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Basic knowledge of the Identity Service Engine (ISE).
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
Cisco Identity Service Engine 2.X
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Background Information
Cisco releases ISE patches on a semi-regular basis. These patches contain bug fixes and, when necessary, security fixes (for example, the  Heartbleed and  Poodle vulnerabilities discovered with SSL).
To ensure that bug fixes are applied, security vulnerabilities are plugged in, and the solution works seamlessly.
When you install a patch on an ISE node, the node is rebooted. Restart the services after the installation is complete. Wait several minutes before you can log in again.
You can schedule patch installations during a maintenance window to avoid a temporary outage.
Install only patches that are applicable for the Cisco version deployed in your network. Cisco reports any mismatch in versions as well as any errors in the patch file.
You cannot install a patch of a lower version than the patch that is currently installed on Cisco. Similarly, you cannot roll back changes of a lower-version patch if a higher version is currently installed on Cisco.
When you install a patch from the  Primary Administration Node (PAN) that is part of a distributed deployment, Cisco ISE installs the patch on the primary node and then on all the secondary nodes in the deployment.
If the patch installation is successful on the  PAN, Cisco ISE then continues patch installation on the secondary nodes. If it fails on the  PAN, the installation does not proceed to the secondary nodes.
However, if the installation fails on any of the secondary nodes for any reason, it still continues with the next secondary node in your deployment.
When you install a patch from the  PAN that is part of a two-node deployment, Cisco installs the patch on the primary node and then on the secondary node.
If the patch installation is successful on the  PAN, Cisco then continues patch installation on the secondary node. If it fails on the  PAN, the installation does not proceed to the secondary node.
You must have the Super Admin or System Admin administrator role to install or roll back the patches. Collect configuration backup and operational backup before the patch installation starts.
Patch Installation With GUI
To download the ISE Patches from Cisco.com, Navigate to  Downloads > Products > Security > Access Control and Policy > Identity Services Engine > Identity Services Engine Software, ( here.)
Note: Cisco ISE patches are normally cumulative, which means that patch 11 installation includes all of the patches from patch 1 to patch 10. Patch installation requires a reboot of the ISE server.
Note: Verify MD5/SHA512 Checksum after the Patch file download.
In order to apply the patch on ISE, log in to ISE  Primary Administration Node (PAN) GUI and follow the instructions mentioned here. 
Step 1. Navigate to  Administration > System > Maintenance > Patch Management > Install.
Step 2. Click  Browse and choose the patch file that was downloaded from Cisco.com.
Step 3.Click  Install to install the Patch.
Patch Installation With CLI
Step 1. Configure an ISE repository and place the required ISE patch in the repository. To configure the ISE repository refer How to Configure Repository on ISE
Step 2. Login to ISE CLI with SSH.
Step 3. Ensure the ISE CLI can list the repository content.
ISE/admin# show repository FTP_repository

ise-patchbundle-10.2.0.7-Patch6-19021923.SPA.x86_64.tar.gz
ise-patchbundle-10.2.0.7-Patch9-19062923.SPA.x86_64.tar.gz
ise-patchbundle-10.1.0.0-Ptach3-19110111.SPA.x86_64.tar.gz
Step 4. In order to install patch on a specific ISE node from the CLI, run the  patch install command in EXEC mode.
Patch install <patch_file_name> <FTP_repository>
Log in to the CLI of the ISE node via SSH and run these commands:

ISE/admin#patch install ise-patchbundle-10.1.0.0-Ptach3-19110111.SPA.x86_64.tar.gz FTP_repository

How to Install the Patch on all the ISE nodes in the Deployment
When you install a patch from the  PAN that is part of a distributed deployment, Cisco ISE installs the patch on the primary node and then all the secondary nodes in the deployment.
If the patch installation is successful on the Primary PAN, Cisco ISE then continues patch installation on the secondary nodes. If it fails on the  PAN, the installation does not proceed to the secondary nodes.
However, if the installation fails on any of the secondary nodes for any reason, it still continues with the next secondary node in your deployment.
How to Roll Back the Patch on all the ISE nodes in the Deployment
To roll back a patch from Cisco ISE nodes in a deployment, you must first roll back the change from the  PAN.
If this is successful, the patch is then rolled back from the secondary nodes. If the rollback process fails on the  PAN, the patches are not rolled back from the secondary nodes.
However, if the patch rollback fails on any secondary node, it still continues to roll back the patch from the next secondary node in your deployment.
While Cisco ISE rolls back the patch from the secondary nodes, you can continue to perform other tasks from the  PAN GUI. The secondary nodes restart after the rollback.
To roll back the ISE patches, log in to  ISE GUI and navigate to  Administration > System > Maintenance > Patch Management > and select the required patch and click  Rollback,as shown:
How to Rollback the Patch from the ISE CLI?
Step 1. SSH to the ISE node in which you would like to remove the patch.
Step 2. Verify the installed patches on the ISE node with the command   Show Version
ISE/admin# show version
