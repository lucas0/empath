12.2(18)SXD
This command was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 12.2(18)SXD.
Usage Guidelines
This command must be used following the crypto ca trustpoint command. If this command is used and the address of the outgoing interface is specified, the router uses the specified address (or address of the specified interface) as the source address for any datagrams that are sent to the certification authority (CA) server or Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server during authentication, enrollment, and if appropriate, when obtaining certificate revocation lists (CRLs).
Examples
In the following example, the router is located in a branch office. The router uses IP Security (IPSec) to communicate with the main office. Ethernet 1 is the "outside" interface that connects to the Internet Service Provider (ISP). Ethernet 0 is the interface connected to the LAN of the branch office. To access the CA server located in the main office the router needs to send its IP datagrams out interface Ethernet 1 (address 10.2.2.205) using the IPSec tunnel. Address 10.2.2.205 is assigned by the ISP. Address 10.2.2.205 is not a part of the branch office or main office.
The CA cannot access any address outside the company because of a firewall. The CA sees a message coming from 10.2.2.205 and cannot respond (that is, it does not know that the router is located in a branch office at address 10.1.1.1, which it is able to reach).
Adding the source interface command tells the router to use address 10.1.1.1 as the source address of the IP datagram that it sends to the CA. The CA is able to respond to 10.1.1.1.
This scenario is configured using the source interface command and the interface addresses as described above.

If you configure the-c keyword and the server does not support the argument that you have shown (des , 3des , aes128-ctr , aes192-ctr , aes256-ctr , aes128-cbc , aes192-cbc , or aes256-cbc ), the remote networking device closes the connection.
-l user-id
(Optional) Specifies the user ID to use when logging in on the remote networking device running the SSH server. If no user ID is specified, the default is the current user ID.
-l user-id : vrf-namenumber ip-address
(Optional) Specifies the user ID when configuring reverse SSH by including port information in the user-id field.
: --Signifies that a VRF name, number, and terminal IP address will follow the user ID.
vrf-name --User-specific VRF.
number --Terminal or auxiliary line number.
ip-address --IP address of the terminal server.
Note
  The user-id argument and : number ip-address delimiter and arguments must be used if you are configuring reverse SSH by including port information in the user-id field (a method that is easier than the longer method of listing each terminal or auxiliary line on a separate command configuration line).The VRF name allows SSH to establish sessions with hosts whose addresses are in a VRF instance.
-l user-id :rotary number ip-address
(Optional) Specifies that the terminal lines are to be grouped under the rotary group for reverse SSH.
:rotary --Signifies that a rotary group number and terminal IP address will follow.
number --Terminal or auxiliary line number.
ip-address --IP address of the terminal server.
Note
  The user-id argument and the :rotary number ip-address delimiter and arguments must be used if you are configuring reverse SSH by including rotary information in the user-id field (a process that is easier than the longer process of listing each terminal or auxiliary line on a separate command configuration line).
-m {hmac-md5-128 | hmac-md5-96 | hmac-sha1-160 | hmac-sha1-96}
(Optional) Specifies a Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) algorithm.
SSH Version 1 does not support HMACs.
If you do not specify the -m keyword, the remote device sends all the supported HMAC algorithms during negotiation. If you specify the -m keyword and the server does not support the algorithm that you have shown (hmac-md5-128, hmac-md5-96, hmac-sha1-160, and hmac-sha1-96), the remote device closes the connection.
-o numberofpasswordprompts n
(Optional) Specifies the number of password prompts that the software generates before ending the session. The SSH server may also apply a limit to the number of attempts. If the limit set by the server is less than the value specified by the -o numberofpasswordprompts keyword, the limit set by the server takes precedence. The default is 3 attempts, which is also the Cisco IOS SSH server default. The range of values is from 1 to 5.
-p port-num
(Optional) Indicates the desired port number for the remote host. The default port number is 22.
ip-addr | hostname
Specifies the IPv4 or IPv6 address or hostname of the remote networking device.
command
(Optional) Specifies the Cisco IOS command that you want to run on the remote networking device. If the remote host is not running Cisco IOS software, this may be any command recognized by the remote host. If the command includes spaces, you must enclose the command in quotation marks.
-vrf
(Optional) Adds VRF awareness to SSH client-side functionality. The VRF instance name in the client is provided with the IP address to look up the correct routing table and establish a connection.

Usage Guidelines
The ssh command enables a Cisco device to make a secure, encrypted connection to another Cisco device running an SSH Version 1 or Version 2 server. This connection provides functionality that is similar to that of an outbound Telnet connection except that the connection is encrypted. With authentication and encryption, the SSH client allows for a secure communication over an insecure network.

Note
SSH Version 1 is supported on DES (56-bit) and 3DES (168-bit) data encryption software images only. In DES software images, DES is the only encryption algorithm available. In 3DES software images, both DES and 3DES encryption algorithms are available.
SSH Version 2 supports only the following crypto algorithms: aes128-ctr, aes192-ctr, aes256-ctr, aes128-cbc, aes192-cbc, and aes256-cbc. SSH Version 2 is supported only in 3DES images.
SSH Version 1 does not support HMAC algorithms.
Examples
The following example illustrates the initiation of a secure session between the local device and the remote host HQhost to run the show users command. The result of the show users command is a list of valid users who are logged in to HQhost. The remote host will prompt for the adminHQ password to authenticate the user adminHQ. If the authentication step is successful, the remote host will return the result of the show users command to the local device and will then close the session.
Device# ssh -l adminHQ HQhost "show users"
The following example illustrates the initiation of a secure session between the local device and the edge device HQedge to run the show ip route command. In this example, the edge device prompts for the adminHQ password to authenticate the user. If the authentication step is successful, the edge device will return the result of the show ip route command to the local device.
Device#ssh -l adminHQ HQedge "show ip route"
The following example shows the SSH client using 3DES to initiate a secure remote command connection with the HQedge device. The SSH server running on HQedge authenticates the session for the admin7 user on the HQedge device using standard authentication methods. The HQedge device must have SSH enabled for authentication to work.
Device# ssh -l admin7 -c 3des -o numberofpasswordprompts 5 HQedge
The following example shows a secure session between the local device and a remote IPv6 device with the address 2001:DB8:0000:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF to run the show running-config command. In this example, the remote IPv6 device prompts for the adminHQ password to authenticate the user. If the authentication step is successful, the remote IPv6 device will return the result of the show running-config command to the local device and will then close the session.
Device# ssh -l adminHQ 2001:DB8:0000:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF "show running-config"
The following example shows an SSH Version 2 session using the crypto algorithm aes256-ctr and an HMAC of hmac-sha1-96. The user ID is user2 and the IP address is 10.76.82.24.
Device# ssh -v 2 -c aes256-ctr -m hmac-sha1-96 -1 user2 10.76.82.24
The following example shows how to configure reverse SSH on the SSH client:
Device# ssh -l lab:1 device.example.com

Modification
12.2(8)T
This command was introduced.
12.4(24)T
Support for IPv6 Secure Neighbor Discovery (SeND) was added.
Usage Guidelines
Before you can issue the subject-name command, you must enable the crypto ca trustpoint command, which declares the certification authority (CA) that your router should use and enters ca-trustpoint configuration mode.
The subject-name command is an attribute that can be set for autoenrollment; thus, issuing this command prevents you from being prompted for a subject name during enrollment.

Modification
Release 12.2(31)ZV1
This command was introduced for session accounting and was implemented on the Cisco 10000 series router for the PRE3.
Cisco IOS XE Release 2.4
This command was integrated into Cisco IOS XE Release 2.4.
Usage Guidelines
The subscriber service session-accounting command enables the router to include all activated services in a single accounting Session-Start message for a session.
RADIUS can activate a service using the RADIUS Access-Accept message. When RADIUS activates a service on the router after the router sends the accounting Session-Start message, the router generates an accounting session update that includes all activated services.
When a session stops, all currently active services are included in the accounting session stop record.
The subscriber service accounting interim-interval command enables the router to generate interim service accounting records at periodic intervals for subscribers. RADIUS Attribute 85 in the user service profile always takes precedence over the configured interim-interval value. RADIUS Attribute 85 must be in the user service profile. See the RADIUS Attributes Overview and RADIUS IETF Attributes feature document for more information.

Note
If RADIUS Attribute 85 is not in the user service profile, then the interim-interval value is used for service interim accounting records. The interim-interval value is configured by either using the aaa accounting update command in global configuration mode or the action-type command in accounting method list configuration mode. See the Configuring Accounting feature document for more information.
Examples
The following example enables per-service accounting:
Router(config)# subscriber service session-accounting

15.1(4)M3
This command was modified. The netmask keyword and ip-netmask argument were made mandatory.
Usage Guidelines
Before configuring the svc address-pool command, use the ip local pool command to define the address pool. The standard configuration assumes that the IP addresses in the pool are reachable from a directly connected network.
Configuring Address Pools for Networks That Are Not Directly Connected
If you need to configure an address pool for IP addresses from a network that is not directly connected, perform the following steps:
Create a local loopback interface and configure it with an IP address and subnet mask from the address pool.
Configure the address pool with the ip local pool command. The range of addresses must fall under the subnet mask configured in Step 1.
Configure the svc address-pool command with the address pool name configured in Step 2.
See the “Examples” section for an example of how to configure a pool of IP addresses to assign to end users in a policy group.

Note
The Switched Virtual Circuits (SVC) software or the Secure Sockets Layer VPN (SSL VPN) client is the predecessor of the Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client software.

The maximum size of prefragmented packets that is supported by the adapter is only 1406 bytes. Sending packets larger than 1406 bytes could cause potential problems; as a result, there is a size restriction.
Examples
The following example configures the MTU size to 778 bytes:
Device(config)# webvpn context context1
Device(config-webvpn-context)# policy group ONE
Device(config-webvpn-group)# svc mtu 778

Modification
12.4(6)T
This command was introduced.
15.1(1)T
This command was modified. The acl keyword and the access-list and access-list-name arguments were added.
Usage Guidelines
Split tunnel support allows you to configure a policy that permits specific traffic to be carried outside the Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client tunnel. Traffic is either included (resolved in tunnel) or excluded (resolved through the Internet service provider [ISP] or WAN connection). Tunnel resolution configuration is mutually exclusive. An IP address cannot be both included and excluded at the same time. Entering the local-lans keyword permits the remote user to access resources on a local LAN, such as a network printer.

Note
Switched Virtual Circuits (SVC), or the Secure Sockets Layer Virtual Private Network (SSL VPN) client, is the predecessor of Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client software.
Examples
The following example shows how to configure a list of IP addresses to be resolved over the tunnel (included) and a list to be resolved outside of the tunnel (excluded):
Router(config-webvpn-group)# svc split exclude 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0
 
Router(config-webvpn-group)# svc split include 172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0

12.2(33)SRA
This command was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 12.2(33)SRA.
Usage Guidelines
If you configure fewer secure MAC addresses than the maximum number of secure MAC addresses on all interfaces, the remaining MAC addresses are dynamically learned.
To clear multiple MAC addresses, you must enter the no form of this command once for each MAC address to be cleared.
The vlan-list argument is visible only if the port has been configured and is operational as a trunk. Enter the switchport mode trunk command and then enter the switchport nonegotiate command.
The sticky keyword configures the dynamic MAC addresses as sticky on an interface. Sticky MAC addresses configure the static Layer 2 entry to stay sticky to a particular interface. This feature can prevent MAC moves or prevent the entry from being learned on a different interface.
You can configure the sticky feature even when the port security feature is not enabled on the interface. It becomes operational once port security is enabled on the interface.

Note
You can enter the switchport port-security mac-address sticky command only if sticky is enabled on the interface.
When port security is enabled, disabling the sticky feature causes all configured and learned sticky addresses to be deleted from the configuration and converted into dynamic secure addresses.
When port security is disabled, disabling the sticky feature causes all configured and learned sticky addresses to be deleted from the configuration.
For trunk ports, if you enter the no switchport port-security mac-address sticky command, a search is conducted for the MAC address in the native VLAN. An error message is displayed if the MAC address is not found in the native VLAN. You must specify the VLAN in the no form of the switchport port-security mac-address sticky command to remove the MAC address.
For voice ports, you must specify the vlan voice keywords in the no form of the command.
Examples
This example shows how to configure a secure MAC address:
Router(config-if)# switchport port-security mac-address 1000.2000.3000
This example shows how to delete a secure MAC address from the address table:
Router(config-if)# no switchport port-security mac-address 1000.2000.3000
This example shows how to enable the sticky feature on an interface:
Router(config-if)# switchport port-security mac-address sticky
This example shows how to disable the sticky feature on an interface:
Router(config-if)# no switchport port-security mac-address sticky
This example shows how to make a specific MAC address as a sticky address:
Router(config-if)# switchport port-security mac-address sticky 0000.0000.0001
This example shows how to delete a specific sticky address:
Router(config-if)# no switchport port-security mac-address sticky 0000.0000.0001
This example shows how to delete all sticky and static addresses that are configured on an interface:
Router(config-if)# no switchport port-security mac-address
The following example shows how to configure a VLAN in the voice port:
Router(config-if)# switch port-security mac-address 0.0.1 vlan voice
To remove the MAC address 0.0.1 from the voice port, use the following command:
Router(config-if)# no switchport port-security mac-address 0.0.1 vlan voice

12.2(33)SRA
This command was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 12.2(33)SRA.
Usage Guidelines
If you enter this command more than once, subsequent use of this command overrides the previous value of maximum . If the new maximum argument is larger than the current number of the secured addresses on this port, there is no effect except to increase the value of the maximum .
If the new maximum is smaller than the old maximum and there are more secure addresses on the old maximum , the command is rejected.
If you configure fewer secure MAC addresses than the maximum number of secure MAC addresses on the port, the remaining MAC addresses are dynamically learned.
Once the maximum number of secure MAC addresses for the port is reached, no more addresses are learned on that port even if the per-VLAN port maximum is different from the aggregate maximum number.
You can override the maximum number of secure MAC addresses for the port for a specific VLAN or VLANs by entering the switchport port-security maximum maximum vlan vlan | vlan-list command.
The vlan-list argument allows you to enter ranges, commas, and delimited entries such as 1,7,9-15,17.
The vlan-list argument is visible only if the port has been configured and is operational as a trunk. Enter the switchport mode trunk command and then enter the switchport nonegotiate command.
Examples
This example shows how to set the maximum number of secure MAC addresses that are allowed on this port:
Router(config-if)# switchport port-security maximum 5

12.2(33)SRA
This command was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 12.2(33)SRA.
12.2(14)SXH
Platform port-security disable traps was introduced as part of protect violation mode.
Usage Guidelines
When a security violation is detected, one of the following actions occurs:
Protect--When the number of port-secure MAC addresses reaches the maximum limit that is allowed on the port, the packets with unknown source addresses are dropped until you remove a sufficient number of secure MAC addresses. Platform port-security disable traps is configurable only when the violation mode is set to protect . When this option is configured, drop entries will not be installed into hardware for violating addresses, thus allowing traffic to continue to flow to violating address from legitimate ports. To protect switch CPU against overload when this option is enabled, we recommend that you configure the port-security rate-limiter to 2000 packets per second with a burst rate of 10.

Note
This feature also permits traffic to legitimate ports from insecure MAC addresses.
Restrict--A port-security violation restricts data and causes the security-violation counter to increment.
Shutdown--The interface is error disabled when a security violation occurs.

Note
When a secure port is in the error-disabled state, you can bring it out of this state by entering the errdisable recovery cause psecure-violation global configuration command or you can manually reenable it by entering the shutdown and no shutdown commands in interface-configuration mode.
Examples
This example shows how to set the action to be taken when a security violation is detected:
Router(config-if)# switchport port-security violation restrict
This example allows the traffic to a secured MAC address on one port to flow even in the presence of violations on other ports while in protect mode.
Router(config-if)# switchport port-security violation protect
Router(config-if)# platform port-security disable traps
