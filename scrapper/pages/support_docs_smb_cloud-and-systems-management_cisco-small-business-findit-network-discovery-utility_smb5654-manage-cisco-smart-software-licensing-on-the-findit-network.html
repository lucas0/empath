Introduction
Cisco Smart Software Licensing is a new way of thinking about licensing. It simplifies the licensing experience across the enterprise making it easier to purchase, deploy, track, and renew Cisco Software. It provides visibility into license ownership and consumption through a single, simple user interface.
With Smart Software Manager, you can organize and view your licenses in groups called virtual accounts. Registering your devices in your virtual account allows you to manage your licenses for departments, areas, or locations within your organization. By using product instance registration tokens, you can easily register your devices with their unique device identifiers (UDIs).
Smart Software Licensing contains information about all of the licenses in your virtual account. It allows you to do the following:
View a list of all licenses in the virtual account.
View information about a specific license and which product is using it.
View information about the alerts for specific licenses.
Transfer licenses between virtual accounts.
Export the list of licenses to a .csv file.
There are three types of Licenses which are valid for a different period of time:
Perpetual licenses remain valid and has no expiration.
Demo Licenses must be renewed after 60 days.
Term Licenses remain valid for specified periods of one to three years.
Licenses are removed from virtual accounts as they expire.
The License page of the FindIT Network Manager allows you to see the number and type of licenses required for your network, and allows you to connect the Manager to the Cisco Smart Licensing system. On this page are two information panels:
Smart Software Licensing Status — This panel shows the registration state of the Smart License client and information about the Smart Account in use.
Smart License Usage — This panel lists the quantities and types of license required based on the current state of the network. This information will automatically update as the network changes, and the Manager will update the number of licenses requested from the Smart Account. The Status field shows whether the required number of licenses have been successfully obtained.
This page also contains controls allowing you to register and manage licenses of the Manager from your Smart account.
If the Manager is running in Evaluation Mode, or is not obtain to obtain sufficient licenses to manage the network, a message will be displayed in the header of the user interface of the FindIT Network Manager. If more than 10 devices are in use in Evaluation Mode, or the Manager cannot obtain sufficient licenses to operate, then you have 90 days to correct the situation. If the problem is not addressed within 90 days, some functionality of the Manager will be restricted until the problem is addressed, either by obtaining more licenses, or reducing the number of devices being managed.
