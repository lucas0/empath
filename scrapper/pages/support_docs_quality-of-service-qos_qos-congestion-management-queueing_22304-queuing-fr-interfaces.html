Layers of Queues
The following figure illustrates the two layers of queues when FRTS is applied to the interface. Applying FRTS and Frame Relay Forum Implementation Agreements (FRF.12) causes the interface-level queue to change to dual FIFO queueing depending on the platfoms that support this queueing technique. The two queues include a high-priority queue to carry Voice over IP (VoIP) and certain control packets and a low-priority queue to carry all other packets. For more information on dual FIFO queueing, see the Dual FIFO section.
Frame Relay interfaces support interface queues as well as PVC queues when FRTS and PVC queueing are enabled. Each PVC queue also supports a separate weighted fair queuing (WFQ) system, if the PVC queue is configured as WFQ.
PVC Queueing
Both Frame Relay and ATM interfaces can support multiple virtual circuits (VCs). Depending on the hardware, these interfaces support PVC queues, which ensure one congested VC does not consume all the memory resources and impact other (non-congested) VCs.
The frame-relay traffic-shaping command enables both traffic shaping and PVC queueing for all VCs on a Frame Relay interface. PVC traffic shaping provides more control over traffic flow on an individual VC. Traffic shaping combined with VC queueing limits the interface bandwidth consumption for a single VC. Without any shaping, a VC can consume all interface bandwidth and starve other VCs.
If you do not specify shaping values, default values for average rate and burst size are applied. When the offered load to the VC exceeds the shaping values, excess packets are stored in the VC's packet-buffering queue. Once the packets are buffered, you can apply a queueing mechanism and effectively control the order of packets dequeued from the VC queue to the interface queue. By default, the PVC queues use first come, first served queueing with a queue limit of 40 packets. Use the frame-relay holdq command in map-class configuration mode to change this value. Alternately, you can apply low latency queueing (LLQ) or class-based weighted fair queueing (CBWFQ) using a Quality of Service (QoS) policy configured with the commands of the modular QoS command-line interface (CLI) (MQC). In addition, you can apply WFQ directly inside the map-class with the fair queue command. This command configures your router to classify traffic according to flow and places these flows in their own subqueues. Thus, the fair queue command creates a WFQ system per VC.
Detailed queueing mechanisms for the PVC queues are described below.
Execute the show frame-relay pvc 20 command. The Frame Relay Data Link Connection Identifier (DLCI) is identified by the 20. The following output shows no queueing information because FRTS is not enabled.
Router# show frame PVC 20

Originally, the frame-relay holdq <size> map-class command was used to configure the size of FIFO traffic shaping queues only. The maximum size was 512. In Cisco IOS Software Release 12.2, and from IOS Software Release 12.2(4) this command also affects the maximum buffers in CBWFQ traffic shaping queues, as enabled by the service-policy output map-class command. The maximum size is now 1024. The defaults, which remain unchanged, are 40 for FIFO and 600 for CBWFQ.
Interface-Level Queueing
After the Frame Relay frames are enqueued in a PVC queue, they are dequeued to interface-level queues. Traffic from all VCs passes through the interface-level queues.
Depending on the configured features, the Frame Relay interface-level queue uses one of the following mechanisms.
Feature Default Queueing Mechanism
FRTS FIFO
FRF.12 Dual FIFO
PIPQ PIPQ
Note: PIPQ (PVC Interface Priority Queueing) overrides FIFO and dual FIFO. In other words, if you enable FRF.12, the interface queueing strategy remains PIPQ.
FIFO Queueing
The following steps explain how the FRTS configuration alters the applied queueing mechanism to FIFO.
Create a channelized interface using the channel-group command.
Router(config)# controller t1 6/0
Router(config-controller)# channel-group 0 ?
  timeslots  List of timeslots in the channel group
   
Router(config-controller)# channel-group 0 timeslots ?
  <1-24> List of timeslots which comprise the channel
  
Router(config-controller)# channel-group 0 timeslots 12
Execute the show interface serial 6/0:0 command and confirm the T1 interface is using the default "Queueing strategy: weighted fair". First, a packet is enqueued to a fancy queue at the VC level. It is then sent to the interface queue. In this case, WFQ would be applied.

When the queueing strategy is WFQ, you can use the show queueing and show queue commands to confirm.

Apply FRTS using the frame-relay traffic-shaping command in interface configuration mode.
Router(config)# interface serial 6/0:0
Router(config-if)# frame-relay traffic-shaping
Applying FRTS prompts the router to change the queueing strategy on the interface-level queues to FIFO.

Since the queueing strategy is now FIFO, the show queue and show queueing command output changes.

'Show queue' not supported with FIFO queueing.
Cisco IOS Software Release 12.2(4)T introduces the Adaptive Frame Relay Traffic Shaping for Interface Congestion feature, which is designed to minimize the effects of delay and packet drops caused by interface congestion. The Adaptive Frame Relay Traffic Shaping for Interface Congestion feature helps ensure that packet drop occurs at the VC queues.
When this new feature is enabled, the traffic-shaping mechanism monitors interface congestion. When the congestion level exceeds a configured value called queue depth, the sending rate of all PVCs is reduced to the minimum committed information rate (minCIR). As soon as interface congestion drops below the queue depth, the traffic-shaping mechanism changes the sending rate of the PVCs back to the committed information rate (CIR). This process guarantees the minCIR for PVCs when there is interface congestion.
Dual FIFO
Frame Relay Queueing, which appears in the output of the show interface serial command as Dual FIFO, uses two priority levels. The high-priority queue handles voice packets and control packets such as Local Management Interface (LMI). The low-priority queue handles fragmented packets (data or non-voice packets).
The interface-level queueing mechanism automatically changes to dual FIFO when you enable one of the following features:
FRF.12 Fragmentation -- This is enabled with the frame-relay fragment command in map-class configuration mode. Data packets larger than the packet size specified in the frame-relay fragment command are first enqueued to a WFQ subqueue. They are then dequeued and fragmented. After fragmentation, the first segment is transmitted. The remaining segments wait for the next available transmission time for that VC, as determined by the shaping algorithm. At this point, small voice packets and fragmented data packets are interleaved from other PVCs.
Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) Prioritization -- Originally, small data packets were also classified as belonging to the high-priority queue simply because of their size. Cisco IOS Software Release 12.0(6)T changed this behavior using the RTP Prioritization (VoIPoFR) feature. It reserves the high-priority queue for voice and LMI control packets only. VoIPoFR classifies VoIP packets by matching on the RTP UDP port range defined in a Frame Relay map-class. All RTP traffic within this port range is enqueued to a priority queue for the VC. In addition, voice packets go into the high priority queue at the interface level. All other packets go into the non-priority queue at the interface level.
Note: This functionality assumes that FRF.12 is configured.
Use the show interface command to view the size of the two queues. The steps below show the dual FIFO queues and describe how to change the queue sizes.
Execute the show interface serial command. The high-priority queue uses a queue limit that is twice the size of the low-priority queue limit.

PIPQ
Frame-Relay PIPQ is designed for configurations in which separate VCs are carrying a single traffic type, such as voice or data. This allows you to assign a priority value to each PVC. PIPQ minimizes serialization or queueing delay at the interface level by ensuring that the high-priority VC is serviced first. PIPQ classifies packets by extracting the DLCI and looking up the priority in the appropriate PVC structure. The PIPQ mechanism does not look at the packet contents. Therefore, it makes no decisions based on packet contents.
Use the following commands to configure PIPQ.
Enable PIPQ with the frame-relay interface-queue priority command on the main interface.
Router(config)# interface serial 6/0:0
Router(config-if)# frame-relay interface-queue priority
Router(config-if)# end
Use the show interface serial command to confirm "Queueing strategy: DLCI priority". This command also displays the current size and number of drops for each queue.

Build a Frame Relay map-class and assign a priority level to a VC using the command frame-relay interface-queue priority {high|medium|normal|low} . The default PVC priority is normal. All PVCs at the same priority share the same FIFO priority queue. Apply the map-class to the VC. In the following sample output, a PVC with DLCI number 21 is assigned to the high-priority interface queue.
Router(config)# map-class frame-relay high_priority_class
Router(config-map-class)# frame-relay interface-queue priority high
Router(config-map-class)# exit

Router(config)# interface serial 6/0:0.2 point
Router(config-subif)# frame-relay interface-dlci 21
Router(config-fr-dlci)# class ?
  WORD  map class name
   
Router(config-fr-dlci)# class high_priority_class
Use the show frame-relay PVC [dlci] and show queueing interface commands to confirm your configuration change.

Optionally, configure the size of each interface queue with the following command. The default sizes of the high, medium, normal, and low priority queues are 20, 40, 60, and 80 packets, respectively. To configure a different value, use the command frame-relay interface-queue priority [<high limit><medium limit><normal limit><low limit>] in the interface configuration mode.
Once enabled, PIPQ overrides any other Frame Relay interface queueing mechanisms, including dual FIFO. If you subsequently enable FRF.12 or FRTS, the interface-level queueing mechanism will not revert to dual FIFO. In addition, PIPQ cannot be enabled if a non-default fancy queueing mechanism already is configured on the interface. It can be enabled in the presence of WFQ if WFQ is the default interface queueing method. Deleting the PIPQ configuration changes the interface-level queueing to the default or to dual FIFO, if FRF.12 is enabled.
PIPQ applies strict priority queuing. If traffic is continuously dequeued to the high-priority queue, the queueing scheduler will schedule the high-priority queue and may effectively starve lower-priority queues. Therefore, take care in assigning PVCs to the high-priority queue.
Tuning the TX Ring
The TX ring is the unprioritized FIFO buffer used to store frames before transmission. Frame Relay interfaces use a single TX ring that is shared by all VCs. By default, the TX ring size is 64 packets for higher-speed serial WAN interfaces, including the PA-T3+, PA-MC-2T3+, and PA-H. Lower-speed WAN port adapters now automatically tune down the TX ring to a value of 2 packets. In other words, interface drivers set unique default TX ring values based on the bandwidth amount.
Queue Location Queueing Methods Service Policies Apply Command to Tune
Hardware queue or transmit ring per interface Port adapter or network module FIFO only No tx-ring-limit
Layer 3 queue per VC Layer 3 processor system or interface buffers FIFO, WFQ, CBWFQ, or LLQ Yes Varies with queueing method:
frame-relay holdq with FIFO
queue-limit with CBWFQ
Note: Unlike ATM interfaces such as the PA-A3, Frame Relay interfaces use a single transmit ring for the interface. They do not build a separate ring for each VC.
It is important to know that the TX ring is FIFO and cannot support an alternate queueing mechanism. Thus, tuning down the TX ring to a value of 2 on low-speed interfaces effectively moves most of the packet buffering to the PVC queue where the fancy queueing mechanisms and QoS service policies do apply.
The following table lists serial port adapters for the 7x00 Series for automatic tuning down of the transmit ring.

The size of the transmit ring is tuned down automatically when a voice-optimizing feature is enabled. In addition, applying PIPQ causes the transmit ring to be tuned down automatically.
