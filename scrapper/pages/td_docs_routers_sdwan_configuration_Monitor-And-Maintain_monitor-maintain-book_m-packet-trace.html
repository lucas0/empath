Description
Bidirectional Support for Packet Tracing
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.8.1a
Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.8.1
Cisco vManage Release 20.8.1
This feature provides a detailed understanding of how data packets are processed by the edge devices in both the directions. Bidirectional debugging can help you to diagnose issues and troubleshoot them more efficiently.
Packet Trace Improvements
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.11.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.11.1
This feature offers the following enhancements to packet trace:
A new command show platform packet-trace fia-statistics , available on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices, displays Feature Invocation Array (FIA) statistics in a packet trace. In FIA statistics, you can find data about a packet trace's feature count, the average processing time, the minimum processing time, and the maximum processing time.
View label information for the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) feature in a packet trace.

Information About Packet Trace
The Packet Trace feature enables you to debug packet loss on edge devices and to inspect any forwarding behavior of traffic flows on the devices in the network. You can configure packet tracer with various conditions based on which the flow of the packets is segregated and is captured for tracing. This helps you to diagnose issues and troubleshoot them more efficiently.
Packet tracer includes 2048 bytes of internal memory that is used to copy path data. This memory is overwritten during circular mode of tracing.
The Packet Trace feature provides three levels of inspection for packets—accounting, summary, and path data. Each level provides a detailed view of packet processing at the cost of some packet-processing capability. However, packet trace limits the inspection of packets that match the debug platform condition statements, and is a viable option even under heavy-traffic situations in customer environments.
From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.8.1a, bidirectional support is added on the edge devices for a conditional debugging match filter. Conditional debugging allows you to filter out some of the debugging information on the edge device. You can check the debugging information that matches a certain interface, MAC address, or username.
Table 2. Packet Trace Levels
Packet Trace Level
Description
Accounting
Packet trace accounting provides a count of packets that enter and leave the network processor. Packet trace accounting is a lightweight performance activity, and runs continuously until it is disabled.
Summary
At the summary level of packet trace, data is collected for a finite number of packets. Packet trace summary tracks the input and output interfaces, the final packet state, the consumed packet state and punt, drop, or inject packets, if any. Collecting summary data adds to additional performance compared to normal packet processing, and can help to isolate a troublesome interface.
Path data
Packet trace path data level provides the greatest level of detail in packet trace. Data is collected for a finite number of packets. Packet trace path data captures data, including a conditional debugging ID that is useful to correlate with feature debugs, a timestamp, and also feature-specific path-trace data.
Path data also has two optional capabilities—packet copy and Feature Invocation Array (FIA) trace. The packet copy option enables you to copy input and output packets at various layers of the packet (layer 2, layer 3, or layer 4). The FIA trace option tracks every feature entry invoked during packet processing and helps you to know what is happening during packet processing.
Note
  Collecting path data consumes more packet-processing resources, and the optional capabilities incrementally affect packet performance. We recommend that you use path-data level in a limited way or in situations where packet performance change is acceptable.
Usage Guidelines for Configuring Packet Trace
Consider the following best practices while configuring the Packet Trace:
Use of ingress conditions when using the packet trace is recommended for a more comprehensive view of packets.
Packet trace configuration requires data plane memory. On systems where data plane memory is constrained, carefully consider how you will select the packet trace values. A close approximation of the amount of memory consumed by packet trace is provided by the following equation:
memory required = (statistics overhead) + (number of packets) * (summary size + data size + packet copy size).
When the Packet Trace feature is enabled, a small, fixed amount of memory is allocated for statistics. Similarly, when per-packet data is captured, a small, fixed amount of memory is required for each packet for summary data. However, as shown by the equation, you can significantly influence the amount of memory consumed by the number of packets you select to trace, and whether you collect path data and copies of packets.

Note
The amount of memory consumed by the packet trace feature is affected by the packet trace configuration. You should carefully select the size of per-packet path data and copy buffers and the number of packets to be traced in order to avoid interrupting other router services.
Limitations
Only IP packets are supported. L2 (ARP) packets, bridge packets, fragmented packets, and multicast packets are not supported.
IPv6 is not supported.
Packet duplication is not supported.
Any packet that goes through resubmission (for example, IPsec or GRE encrypted packets) and matches the configured filters in both the inner packet (decrypted packet) as well as the outer packet (encrypted packet) will have individual trace entries. To use the packet tracer more efficiently, you should configure as many filters as possible with the available information to debug the issue.
Configure Packet Trace
Use the debug platform packet-trace command to configure a packet tracer on edge devices with various conditions such as bidirectional, VPN, circular, destination IP, source IP, interface, start, stop, logging, and clear.
Configure Packet Trace on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices
Enable packet trace for the traffic and specify the maximum number of packets:
Device# debug platform packet-trace packet [number of traced packets]
Specify the matching criteria for tracing packets. Matching criteria provides the ability to filter by protocol, IP address and subnet mask, interface, and direction:
Device# debug platform condition [interface interface name] {match ipv4|ipv6|mac src dst}  {both|ingress|egress} [bidirectional]
Enable MPLS output label trace. A MPLS output label trace is included in debug path to reduce the impact on performance.
Device# debug platform hardware qfp active feature cef-mpls datapath mpls all
Enable the specified matching criteria and start packet tracing:
Device# debug platform condition start
Deactivate the condition and stop packet tracing:
Device# debug platform condition stop
Exit the privileged EXEC mode:
exit
Configure Packet Trace on Cisco vEdge devices
The following example shows how to configure conditions for packet tracing:
Device# debug packet-trace condition source-ip 10.1.1.1
Device# debug packet-trace condition vpn-id 0
Device# debug packet-trace condition interface ge0/1
Device# debug packet-trace condition stop
For more information, see debug packet-trace condition command page.
Monitor Packet Trace
Packet trace configuration is based on the AND operation of the specified conditions, with the packets matching all the configured conditions being traced.

Use the show platform packet-trace summary command to view detailed information for the specified trace ID. The detailed packet view output displays three sections—summary data section, packet dump section, and featured data section.
Summary data section: Displays packet trace ID, ingress interface, egress interface, and the forward decision taken for the packet to traverse across the device information for the specified trace ID.
Packet dump section: Displays ingress and egress packet information. Only the first 96 bytes of packet header details are displayed.

Note
The complete packet dump is not displayed because of tracer-memory limitations.
Feature data section: Displays forwarding plane features that generate feature-specific tracing data and provides feature data decodes. These features provide debugging information to packet tracer, such as forward result, drop reason, and other behavior.
