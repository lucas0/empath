What's New in Cisco IOS XR Release
Cisco is continuously enhancing the product with every release and this section covers a brief description of key features and enhancements. It also includes links to detailed documentation, where available.
Feature Description
Configuration
10sec PM buckets
Performance monitoring parameters for the Optics, Ethernet, and Coherent DSP controllers in 10 second intervals are available. This new bucket for performance monitoring allows you to gather, store, and report performance data with higher granularity.
Commands modified:
pm
controller optics
controller GigECtrlr
controller coherentDSP
show controllers
Data Models
NETCONF Support for READ, WRITE, and Execute or Administrative Commands.
Support for IPv4 and IPv6 Ping test using the Cisco-IOS-XR-ping-act YANG model, instead of using CLI commands, is available. RPC (Remote Procedure Call) Request and Response messages are used to do the ping test, which is automated using scripts. This enables you to perform the ping test in a less time-consuming manner and to enhance network scalability.
OC (Open Configuration) Model for Client FEC and Laser Squelch
The OC model for configuring client FEC and Laser Squelch is available. This feature enables you to perform the configuration using scripts, which is less time-consuming. Also, the Open Configuration model supports the use of vendor-neutral data models to configure and manage the network.
OC (Open Configuration) Terminal Device Revision
The Open Configuration terminal device revision to 1.7.2 allows you to provide LLDP support on the client optics. This feature allows you to learn LLDP neighbors and the topology of the devices for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) purposes.
