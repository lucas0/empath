How to Deploy the Management Center Virtual on Nutanix
Host System Requirements
We recommend you do not decrease the default settings: 32 GB RAM for most the management center virtual instances. To improve performance, you can always increase a virtual appliance’s memory and number of CPUs, depending on your available resources.
Memory and Resource Requirements
You can run multiple virtual machines running unmodified OS images using Nutanix AHV. Each virtual machine has private virtualized hardware: a network card, disk, graphics adapter, and so forth. See the Cisco Firepower Compatibility Guide for hypervisor compatibility.
Check for the latest Release Notes for details on whether a new release affects your environment. You may be required to increase resources to deploy the latest version.
The specific hardware used for the management center virtual deployments can vary, depending on the number of instances deployed and usage requirements. Each virtual appliance you create requires a minimum resource allocation—memory, number of CPUs, and disk space—on the host machine.
The following lists the recommended and default settings for the management center virtual appliance on Nutanix AHV:
Processors
Requires 4 vCPUs
Memory
Minimum required 28 GB / Recommended (default) 32 GB RAM

Important
The management center virtual platform fails if you allocate less than 28 GB RAM to the virtual appliance.
Networking
Supports virtio drivers
Supports one management interface
Host storage per Virtual Machine
The management center virtual requires 250 GB
Supports virtio and scsi block devices
Console
Supports terminal server via telnet

Management Center Virtual Upgrade from 7.0.x or earlier to 7.2.0
If you upgrade the management center virtual deployed on Nutanix from version 7.0.x or earlier to version 7.2.0, the web UI will not start and you cannot log in. Perform any of the following workarounds to resolve the issue:
Attach a virtual serial console port to the management center virtual from the Nutanix controller VM and allow the boot sequence to complete after the upgrade.
Before upgrading from version 7.0.x or earlier to version 7.2.0, attach a virtual serial console port to the management center virtual from the Nutanix controller VM.
Initiate a fresh install of the management center virtual version 7.0.0 and attach a virtual serial console port to the management center virtual from the Nutanix controller VM. After 7.0.0 is installed, initiate the upgrade to 7.2.0.
To create and attach a virtual serial port to the management center virtual, perform the following steps:
Power off the management center virtual instance.
Run the following Acropolis CLI (aCLI) commands in the Nutanix CVM aCLI:
vm.serial_port_create <management-center-virtual-VM-name> type=kServer index=0
vm.update <management-center-virtual-VM-name> disable_branding=true
vm.update <management-center-virtual-VM-name> extra_flags="enable_hyperv_clock=False"
Power on the management center virtual instance.
