Workflow for Smart Account and Virtual Accounts for Provisioning the Controllers
The following is the workflow for creating a Smart Account, a Virtual Account, and associating the Cisco DNA subscription with your Virtual Account.
Create a Smart Account for your organization on Cisco Software Central.
Create a Virtual Account associated with your Smart Account.
For information on how to create a Virtual Account, see Create a Virtual Account Associated with Your Smart Account.
Purchase a Cisco DNA subscription on the Cisco Commerce Workspace.

Note
A Cisco DNA subscription should be associated with one of the Virtual Accounts under the respective Smart Account.
Typically, an account manager or a Cisco sales representative places the order on the behalf of the customer.
Choose the DNA cloud subscription product identification (PID) as the license.
The selection of the DNA cloud subscription PID triggers the automatic association of the Virtual Account with the SD-WAN-capable attribute for provisioning of the controllers.
When the order is complete, the Virtual Account is available on the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal for controller provisioning.

Note
The Virtual Account should contain the device serial numbers that were added on the Cisco Plug and Play (PnP) portal. Once the overlay is created through the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal, see the Controller Profile tab on the Cisco PnP portal to view the mapping of the device serial numbers with their respective controllers. The mapping of device serial numbers to the controllers provides the necessary information for adding the devices to Cisco vManage or performing zero-touch provisioning (ZTP). View the Controller Profile tab in the Cisco PnP portal to confirm that the controllers were provisioned as part of the Cisco SD-WAN overlay creation process using the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal.
For more information, see Cisco Network Plug and Play Connect Capability Overview.

Workflow for PCI-Certified Overlays
Workflow for PCI-Certified Overlays for New Customers
If you are a new Cisco SD-WAN customer or partner, place an order on the Cisco Commerce Workspace.
Choose the Certified Hosting Infra for vManage PID subscription option.
Follow the same steps as for any other order.

Note
Ensure that you select the correct PID that corresponds to the PCI-certified overlay.
Workflow for PCI-Certified Overlays for Existing Customers
If you are an existing Cisco SD-WAN customer or partner, place an order on the Cisco Commerce Workspace with an existing Virtual Account.
Choose the Certified Hosting Infra for vManage PID subscription option.
Create a ticket in Cisco One.
Include the following information in the ticket:
Virtual Account
Organization Name
Order Number
Region
The Cisco CloudOps team confirms the order number and upgrades an existing overlay as a PCI-certified overlay.
Access the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal for the First Time
When you log in to the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal for the first time, a guided workflow is presented. This workflow provides you the option to configure some features and create your first Cisco SD-WAN overlay network.
You must be a Smart Account administrator to log in to the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal for the first time and for subsequent log-ins if you are not using an identity provider (IdP).
If you are using an IdP, access to the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal is based on user access provided by the IdP.

Note
You cannot log in to the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal using Virtual Account administrator-level access as you can with other Cisco portals such as software.cisco.com. The Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal does not accept Virtual Account administrator-level access.
Log in to the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal
When you log in to the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal, you must use your Cisco credentials.
Navigate to the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal URL.
Enter your Cisco login credentials.
When prompted, set up or enter your MFA credentials.
Configure Additional MFA Options or Update an Existing MFA Option
You can add an additional MFA option or update an existing MFA option using the Cisco SD-WAN portal.
Before You Begin
Ensure that you can log in successfully to the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal.
Add or Update an MFA Option
After having successfully logged in to the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal, navigate to Cisco SD-WAN SSO.
On the SSO page, you will see Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal under the Work tab.
From the drop-down list by your name in the right-hand corner of the page, click Settings.
In the Extra Verification section, add an MFA option or update an existing MFA option.
