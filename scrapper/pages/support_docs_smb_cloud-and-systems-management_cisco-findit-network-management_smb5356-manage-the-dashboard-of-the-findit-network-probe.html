Objective
The Dashboard in the Cisco FindIT Network Probe allows you to view the performance of the network as well as the devices connected to it in real time, allowing you to take necessary steps as soon as you see the status of the network. Widgets are used to display the data in graphical form. By default, Device Health, WLAN Client Count, Device Client Count, and Traffic are the widgets displayed in the Dashboard. This can be customized by choosing only the information you want to be displayed while hiding the others. The layout of the Dashboard can also be changed according to your preference.
This article aims to show you how to manage the Dashboard on the FindIT Network Probe. It assumes that you already have the necessary settings configured on the devices to be discovered by the FindIT Network Probe.
