Cisco NCS 1002 Overview
Cisco NCS 1002 is a 2Tbps muxponder that addresses the growing bandwidth needs of data center DWDM applications. It provides dense, low power (<80W per 100G), and cost optimized DWDM transport for 10G, 40G, and 100G clients. The trunk ports can operate at 100G, 200G, and 250G traffic. The muxponder is 2 RU. NCS 1002 is ROHS6 compliant.
NCS 1002 has four independent slices. Each slice contains five QSFP+/QFSP28 client optical ports and two CFP2 DWDM trunk ports. Each slice delivers up to 500 Gbps traffic.

Connect AC Power to NCS 1002

Caution
NCS 1002 relies on the protective devices in the building installation to protect against short circuit, overcurrent, and ground faults. Ensure that the protective devices comply with local and national electrical codes.
The voltage rating value for AC power ranges either between 200 V to 240 V or between 100 V to 115 V depending on the standards in various countries.

Caution
When the input voltage is 110 V, you cannot provision slice 2 and 3 as they are not detected. In this state, alarms are raised for slices 2 and 3.

Note
A dual pole breaker is needed for the installation. The rating of the dual pole breaker is 15A.
SUMMARY STEPS
Verify that the AC cable is installed in the correct AC source panel. Ensure that either the fuse is removed or the circuit breaker is in the off position and locked out.
Attach the AC power cable to the cable connector in the AC power module.
Close the cable clamp to secure the power cable.
Ensure that the lockout device is removed if installed and turn on the circuit breaker(s) to the shelf. Verify that the Green LED on the PSU is on.
DETAILED STEPS
Step 1
Verify that the AC cable is installed in the correct AC source panel. Ensure that either the fuse is removed or the circuit breaker is in the off position and locked out.
For an AC power supply, fuse or breaker rating must not exceed 15A.
Step 2
Attach the AC power cable to the cable connector in the AC power module.
Step 3
Close the cable clamp to secure the power cable.
