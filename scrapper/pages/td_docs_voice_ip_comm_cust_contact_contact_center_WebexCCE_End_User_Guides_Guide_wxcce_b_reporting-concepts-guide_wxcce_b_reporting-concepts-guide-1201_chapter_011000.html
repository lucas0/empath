Network VRU and Call Type Metrics
All of the Call Type metrics apply to Webex CCE. In Webex CCE systems, Answer Wait Time, ASA, and Service Level include both the time spent in the network queue and the time spent in the ACD queue.
The measurement of Answer Wait Time for a call begins when the call is queued. The measurement of Service Level begins when the call arrives at the routing script, or when its call type is changed. This means that if self-service is performed on a call before the call is queued to an agent, the routing script must be set up to change the call type of the call when self-service is completed. Otherwise, the time spent in self-service negatively impacts the Service Level.
With regard to ICM-Not-TR systems, the Call Type abandoned metrics allow you to determine the number of calls that abandoned while queued in the CallRouter, but they do not allow you to determine the number of calls that abandoned while in self service, nor the number of calls that were abandoned after they leave the VRU and before an agent answers them. The Call Type answered metrics are always zero. The Call Type Service Level metrics are meaningless and can be ignored.
The following table shows the fields in the Call_Type_Real_Time table that affect reporting metrics by metric category:

Network VRU and Skill Group Metrics
For a call that is queued by CVP, the Answer Wait Time and ASA metrics for the skill group do not include the time spent in the network queue. However, service level metrics for the skill group do include the time spent in the network queue.
The skill group abandoned metrics allow you to determine the number of calls that abandoned while queued to the CallRouter, but they do not allow you to determine the number of calls that abandoned after they left the VRU and before an agent answered them. The skill group answered metrics are always zero. The skill group service level metrics are meaningless and can be ignored.

Note
None of the skill group metrics include time spent in self-service or calls that ended during self-service, because a call is not associated with a skill group until it is queued, and a call is queued after self-service is complete.
The following table shows the fields (by metric category) in the Skill_Group_Real_Time table that affect reporting metrics:
