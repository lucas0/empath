Defect ID Headline

Problem Description
Some versions of Firepower Management Center (FMC) software might cause the security management platform to halt unexpectedly.
Background

Problem Symptom
The FMC appliance halts and indicates "System processes are starting" over the console port.
When you switch to expert mode in the CLI, this message is displayed:
You have logged in while system startup is in progress. Please wait, some feature may be unavailable until startup is complete.
The web-based GUI shows this message:
