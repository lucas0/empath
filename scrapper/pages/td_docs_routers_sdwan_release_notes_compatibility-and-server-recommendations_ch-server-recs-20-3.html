Note
When DPI is enabled, you must set the Statistics Collection timer to 30 minutes or higher.
To set the Statistics Collection timer,
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Administration > Settings.
Click Edit next to Statistics Configuration.
Modify the Collection Interval minutes to the desired value based on your DPI traffic, the default collection interval is 30 minutes.
Click Save.
* vCPU, RAM, and Storage Size numbers are on per Cisco vManage basis. The Storage Size numbers are the maximum tested values by Cisco, you can allocate smaller storage sizes.
To achieve scale beyond the above mentioned numbers, deploy multiple overlays.
