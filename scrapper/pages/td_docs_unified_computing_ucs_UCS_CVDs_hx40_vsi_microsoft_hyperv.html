Executive Summary
With the proliferation of virtualized environments across most IT landscapes, other technology stacks which have traditionally not offered the same levels of simplicity, flexibility, and rapid deployment as virtualized compute platforms have come under increasing scrutiny. In particular, networking devices and storage systems have lacked the agility of hypervisors and virtual servers. With the introduction of Cisco HyperFlex, Cisco has brought the dramatic enhancements of hyperconvergence to the modern data center.
Cisco HyperFlex systems are based on the Cisco UCS platform, combining Cisco HX-Series x86 servers and integrated networking technologies through the Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects, into a single management domain, along with industry leading virtualization hypervisor software from Microsoft, and next-generation software defined storage technology. The combination creates a complete virtualization platform, which provides the network connectivity for the guest virtual machine connections, and the distributed storage to house the virtual machines, spread across all of the Cisco UCS x86 servers, versus using specialized storage or networking components. The unique storage features of the HyperFlex log-based filesystem enable rapid cloning of virtual machines, snapshots without the traditional performance penalties, and inline data deduplication and compression. All configuration, deployment, management, and monitoring of the solution can be done with existing tools for Cisco UCS and Microsoft, such as Cisco UCS Manager and Microsoft Hyper-V Manager, PowerShell, SCVMM, and new integrated HTML based management tools, such as Cisco HyperFlex Connect and Cisco Intersight. This powerful linking of advanced technology stacks into a single, simple, rapidly deployed solution makes Cisco HyperFlex a true second generation hyperconverged platform. Customers can choose to deploy SSD-only All-Flash HyperFlex clusters for improved performance, increased density, and reduced latency, or use HyperFlex hybrid clusters which combine high-performance SSDs and low-cost, high-capacity HDDs to optimize the cost of storing data. Further enhancements include improvements and customization capabilities in the HyperFlex Connect management tool, larger scale 32-node clusters, large form-factor disks for larger storage capacity.
Solution Overview
Introduction
The Cisco HyperFlex System provides an all-purpose virtualized server platform, with hypervisor hosts, networking connectivity, and virtual server storage across a set of Cisco UCS HX-Series x86 rack-mount servers. Legacy datacenter deployments have relied on a disparate set of technologies, each performing a distinct and specialized function, such as network switches connecting endpoints and transferring Ethernet network traffic, and Fibre Channel (FC) storage arrays providing block based storage via a dedicated storage array network (SAN). Each of these systems had unique requirements for hardware, connectivity, management tools, operational knowledge, monitoring, and ongoing support. A legacy virtual server environment was often divided up into areas commonly referred to as silos, within which only a single technology operated, along with their correlated software tools and support staff. Silos could often be divided between the x86 computing hardware, the networking connectivity of those x86 servers, SAN connectivity and storage device presentation, the hypervisors and virtual platform management, and finally the guest virtual machine themselves along with their OS and applications. This model proves to be inflexible, difficult to navigate, and is susceptible to numerous operational inefficiencies.
A more modern datacenter model was developed called a converged infrastructure. Converged infrastructures attempt to collapse the traditional silos by combining these technologies into a more singular environment, which has been designed to operate together in pre-defined, tested, and validated designs. A key component of the converged infrastructure was the revolutionary combination of x86 rack and blade servers, along with converged Ethernet and Fibre Channel networking offered by the Cisco UCS platform. Converged infrastructures leverage Cisco UCS, plus new deployment tools, management software suites, automation processes, and orchestration tools to overcome the difficulties deploying traditional environments and do so in a much more rapid fashion. These new tools place the ongoing management and operation of the system into the hands of fewer staff, with more rapid deployment of workloads based on business needs, while still remaining at the forefront of flexibility to adapt to workload needs and offering the highest possible performance. Cisco has had incredible success in these areas with our various partners, developing leading solutions such as Cisco FlexPod, FlashStack, VersaStack, and VxBlock architectures. Despite these advances, because these converged infrastructures contained some legacy technology stacks, particularly in the storage subsystems, there often remained a division of responsibility amongst multiple teams of administrators. There is also a recognition that these converged infrastructures can still be a somewhat complex combination of components, where a simpler system would suffice to serve the workloads being requested.   
Significant changes in the storage marketplace have given rise to the software defined storage (SDS) system. Legacy FC storage arrays often contained a specialized subset of hardware, such as Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop (FC-AL) based controllers and disk shelves along with optimized Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC), read/write data caching modules and cards, plus highly customized software to operate the arrays. With the rise of Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) bus technology and its inherent benefits, storage array vendors began to transition their internal hardware architectures to SAS, and with dramatic increases in processing power from recent x86 processor architectures, they also used fewer or no custom ASICs at all. As disk physical sizes shrank, x86 servers began to have the same density of storage per rack unit (RU) as the arrays themselves, and with the proliferation of NAND based flash memory solid state disks (SSD), they also now had access to input/output (IO) devices whose speed rivaled that of dedicated caching devices. If servers themselves now contained storage devices and technology to rival many dedicated arrays on the market, then the major differentiator between them was the software providing allocation, presentation, and management of the storage, plus the advanced features many vendors offered. This has led to the rise of software defined storage, where the x86 servers with the storage devices ran software to effectively turn one or more of them, working cooperatively, into a storage array much the same as the traditional arrays were. In a somewhat unexpected turn of events, some of the major storage array vendors themselves were pioneers in this field, recognizing the technological shifts in the market, and attempting to profit from the software features they offered versus their specialized hardware, as had been done in the past.
Some early uses of SDS systems simply replaced the traditional storage array in the converged architectures as described earlier. That configuration still had a separate storage system from the virtual server hypervisor platform, and depending on the solution provider, still remained separate from the network devices. If the servers that hosted the virtual machines, and also provided the SDS environment were in fact the same model of server, could they simply do both things at once and collapse the two functions into one? This ultimate combination of resources becomes what the industry has given the moniker of a hyperconverged infrastructure. Hyperconverged infrastructures coalesce the computing, memory, hypervisor, and storage devices of servers into a single platform for virtual servers. There is no longer a separate storage system, as the servers running the hypervisors also provide the software defined storage resources to store the virtual servers, effectively storing the virtual machines on themselves. Now nearly all the silos are gone, and a hyperconverged infrastructure becomes something almost completely self-contained, simpler to use, faster to deploy, easier to consume, yet still flexible and with very high performance. Many hyperconverged systems still rely on standard networking components, such as on-board network cards in the x86 servers, and top-of-rack switches. The Cisco HyperFlex system combines the convergence of computing and networking provided by Cisco UCS, along with next-generation hyperconverged storage software, to uniquely provide the compute resources, network connectivity, storage, and hypervisor platform to run an entire virtual environment, all contained in a single uniform system.
Some key advantages of hyperconverged infrastructures are the simplification of deployment, day to day management operations, as well as increased agility, thereby reducing the amount operational costs. Since hyperconverged storage can be easily managed by an IT generalist, this can also reduce technical debt going forward that is often accrued by implementing complex systems that need dedicated management teams and skillsets.

Technology Overview
Cisco Unified Computing System
Cisco Unified Computing System (Cisco UCS) is a next-generation data center platform that unites compute, network, and storage access. The platform, optimized for virtual environments, is designed using open industry-standard technologies and aims to reduce total cost of ownership (TCO) and increase business agility. The system integrates a low-latency, lossless 10 Gigabit Ethernet or 40 Gigabit Ethernet unified network fabric with enterprise-class, x86-architecture servers. It is an integrated, scalable, multi chassis platform in which all resources participate in a unified management domain.
The main components of Cisco Unified Computing System are:
Â·         Computing: The system is based on an entirely new class of computing system that incorporates rack-mount and blade servers based on Intel Xeon Processors.
Â·         Network: The system is integrated onto a low-latency, lossless, 10-Gbps, 25-Gbps or 40-Gbps unified network fabric. This network foundation consolidates LANs, SANs, and high-performance computing networks which are often separate networks today. The unified fabric lowers costs by reducing the number of network adapters, switches, and cables, and by decreasing the power and cooling requirements.
Â·         Virtualization: The system unleashes the full potential of virtualization by enhancing the scalability, performance, and operational control of virtual environments. Cisco security, policy enforcement, and diagnostic features are now extended into virtualized environments to better support changing business and IT requirements.
Â·         Storage access: The system provides consolidated access to both SAN storage and Network Attached Storage (NAS) over the unified fabric. By unifying storage access, the Cisco Unified Computing System can access storage over Ethernet, Fibre Channel, Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE), and iSCSI. This provides customers with their choice of storage protocol and physical architecture, and enhanced investment protection. In addition, the server administrators can pre-assign storage-access policies for system connectivity to storage resources, simplifying storage connectivity, and management for increased productivity.
Â·         Management: The system uniquely integrates all system components which enable the entire solution to be managed as a single entity by the Cisco UCS Manager (UCSM). The Cisco UCS Manager has an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), a command-line interface (CLI), and a robust application programming interface (API) to manage all system configuration and operations.
The Cisco Unified Computing System is designed to deliver:
Â·         A reduced Total Cost of Ownership and increased business agility.
Â·         Increased IT staff productivity through just-in-time provisioning and mobility support.
Â·         A cohesive, integrated system which unifies the technology in the data center. The system is managed, serviced, and tested as a whole.
Â·         Scalability through a design for hundreds of discrete servers and thousands of virtual machines and the capability to scale I/O bandwidth to match demand.
Â·         Industry standards supported by a partner ecosystem of industry leaders.
Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect
The Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect (FI) is a core part of the Cisco Unified Computing System, providing both network connectivity and management capabilities for the system. Depending on the model chosen, the Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect offers line-rate, low-latency, lossless 10 Gigabit or 40 Gigabit Ethernet, Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) and Fibre Channel connectivity. Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects provide the management and communication backbone for the Cisco UCS C-Series, S-Series, and HX-Series Rack-Mount Servers, Cisco UCS B-Series Blade Servers, and Cisco UCS 5100 Series Blade Server Chassis. All servers and chassis, and therefore all blades, attached to the Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects become part of a single, highly available management domain. In addition, by supporting unified fabrics, the Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects provide both the LAN and SAN connectivity for all servers within its domain.
From a networking perspective, the Cisco UCS 6200 Series uses a cut-through architecture, supporting deterministic, low latency, line rate 10 Gigabit Ethernet on all ports, up to 1.92 Tbps switching capacity and 160 Gbps bandwidth per chassis, independent of packet size and enabled services. The product family supports Cisco low-latency, lossless 10 Gigabit Ethernet unified network fabric capabilities, which increase the reliability, efficiency, and scalability of Ethernet networks. The Fabric Interconnect supports multiple traffic classes over the Ethernet fabric from the servers to the uplinks. Significant TCO savings come from an FCoE-optimized server design in which network interface cards (NICs), host bus adapters (HBAs), cables, and switches can be consolidated.
The Cisco UCS 6300 Series offers the same features while supporting even higher performance, low latency, lossless, line rate 40 Gigabit Ethernet, with up to 2.56 Tbps of switching capacity. Backward compatibility and scalability are assured with the ability to configure 40 Gbps quad SFP (QSFP) ports as breakout ports using 4x10GbE breakout cables. Existing Cisco UCS servers with 10GbE interfaces can be connected in this manner, although Cisco HyperFlex nodes must use a 40GbE VIC adapter in order to connect to a Cisco UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnect.
The Cisco UCS 6454 uses a cut-through architecture, supporting deterministic, low-latency, line-rate 10/25/40/100 Gigabit Ethernet ports, a switching capacity of 3.82 Tbps, and 320 Gbps bandwidth between FI 6454 and IOM 2208 per 5108 blade chassis, independent of packet size and enabled services. The product family supports CiscoÂ® low-latency, lossless 10/25/40/100 Gigabit Ethernet unified network fabric capabilities, which increase the reliability, efficiency, and scalability of Ethernet networks. The Fabric Interconnect supports multiple traffic classes over a lossless Ethernet fabric from the server through the Fabric Interconnect.
Cisco UCS 6248UP Fabric Interconnect
The Cisco UCS 6248UP Fabric Interconnect is a one-rack-unit (1RU) 10 Gigabit Ethernet, FCoE and Fiber Channel switch offering up to 960 Gbps throughput and up to 48 ports. The switch has 32 1/10-Gbps fixed Ethernet, FCoE, or 1/2/4/8 Gbps FC ports, plus one expansion slot.

Cisco UCS 6332-16UP Fabric Interconnect
The Cisco UCS 6332-16UP Fabric Interconnect is a one-rack-unit (1RU) 10/40 Gigabit Ethernet, FCoE, and native Fibre Channel switch offering up to 2430 Gbps of throughput. The switch has 24 40-Gbps fixed Ethernet and FCoE ports, plus 16 1/10-Gbps fixed Ethernet, FCoE, or 4/8/16 Gbps FC ports. Up to 18 of the 40-Gbps ports can be reconfigured as 4x10Gbps breakout ports, providing up to 88 total 10-Gbps ports.
Figure 5         Cisco UCS 6332-16UP Fabric Interconnect
          When used for a Cisco HyperFlex deployment, due to mandatory QoS settings in the configuration, the 6332 and 6332-16UP will be limited to a maximum of four 4x10Gbps breakout ports, which can be used for other non-HyperFlex servers.
Cisco UCS 6454 Fabric Interconnect
The Cisco UCS 6454 54-Port Fabric Interconnect is a One-Rack-Unit (1RU) 10/25/40/100 Gigabit Ethernet, FCoE and Fibre Channel switch offering up to 3.82 Tbps throughput and up to 54 ports. The switch has 36 10/25-Gbps Ethernet ports, 4 1/10/25-Gbps Ethernet ports, 6 40/100-Gbps Ethernet uplink ports and 8 unified ports that can support 8 10/25-Gbps Ethernet ports or 8/16/32-Gbps Fibre Channel ports. All Ethernet ports are capable of supporting FCoE.

Cisco HyperFlex HX-Series Nodes
A HyperFlex cluster requires a minimum of three HX-Series âconvergedâ nodes (with disk storage). Data is replicated across at least two of these nodes, and a third node is required for continuous operation in the event of a single-node failure. Each node that has disk storage is equipped with at least one high-performance SSD drive for data caching and rapid acknowledgment of write requests. Each node also is equipped with additional disks, up to the platformâs physical limit, for long term storage and capacity.
          In the following Cisco UCS HX server models, SED and NVMe cache drives are not supported on HyperFlex systems with Microsoft Hyper-V  at the time of publishing this document.

Cisco VIC 1387 MLOM Interface Cards
The Cisco UCS VIC 1387 Card is a dual-port Enhanced Quad Small Form-Factor Pluggable (QSFP+) 40-Gbps Ethernet and Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE)-capable PCI Express (PCIe) modular LAN-on-motherboard (mLOM) adapter installed in the Cisco UCS HX-Series Rack Servers. The VIC 1387 is used in conjunction with the Cisco UCS 6332 or 6332-16UP model Fabric Interconnects.
The mLOM slot can be used to install a Cisco VIC without consuming a PCIe slot, which provides greater I/O expandability. It incorporates next-generation converged network adapter (CNA) technology from Cisco, providing investment protection for future feature releases. The card enables a policy-based, stateless, agile server infrastructure that can present up to 256 PCIe standards-compliant interfaces to the host, each dynamically configured as either a network interface card (NICs) or host bus adapter (HBA). The personality of the interfaces is set programmatically using the service profile associated with the server. The number, type (NIC or HBA), identity (MAC address and Worldwide Name [WWN]), failover policy, adapter settings, bandwidth, and quality-of-service (QoS) policies of the PCIe interfaces are all specified using the service profile.

Cisco VIC 1457 MLOM Interface Cards
The Cisco UCS VIC 1400 platform extends the network fabric directly to both servers and virtual machines so that a single connectivity mechanism can be used to connect both physical and virtual servers with the same level of visibility and control. Cisco VICs provide complete programmability of the Cisco UCS I/O infrastructure, with the number and type of I/O interfaces configurable on demand with a zero-touch model.  Cisco VICs support Cisco SingleConnect technology, which provides an easy, intelligent, and efficient way to connect and manage computing in your data center. Cisco SingleConnect unifies LAN, SAN, and systems management into one simplified link for rack servers, blade servers, and virtual machines. This technology reduces the number of network adapters, cables, and switches needed and radically simplifies the network, reducing complexity. Cisco VICs can support 256 PCIe virtual devices, either virtual NICs (vNICs) or virtual HBAs (vHBAs), a high rate of I/O operations per second (IOPS), support for lossless Ethernet, and 10- and 40-Gbps connection to servers. The PCIe 3.0 x16 interface helps ensure optimal bandwidth to the host for network-intensive applications, with a redundant path to the fabric interconnect. Cisco VICs support NIC teaming, with fabric failover for increased reliability and availability. In addition, it provides a policy-based, stateless, agile server infrastructure for your data center.  The VIC 1400 series is designed exclusively for the M5 generation of Cisco UCS B-Series Blade Servers, C-Series Rack Servers, and S-Series Storage Servers. The adapters are capable of supporting 10-, 25, and 40-Gigabit Ethernet and Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE). The VIC incorporates Ciscoâs next-generation converged network adapter (CNA) technology and offers a comprehensive feature set, providing investment protection for future feature software releases. In addition, the VIC supports Cisco Data Center Virtual Machine Fabric Extender (VM-FEX) technology. This technology extends the Cisco UCS fabric interconnect ports to virtual machines, simplifying server virtualization deployment.
Cisco UCS VIC 1457 is based on the most recent generation of the Cisco UCS VIC 1400 platform. The Cisco UCS VIC 1457 (Figure 13) is a quad-port Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP28) mLOM card designed for the M5 generation of Cisco UCS C-Series Rack Servers. The card supports 10/25-Gbps Ethernet or FCoE. The card can present PCIe standards-compliant interfaces to the host, and these can be dynamically configured as either NICs or HBAs.

All-Flash versus Hybrid
The initial HyperFlex product release featured hybrid converged nodes, which use a combination of solid-state disks (SSDs) for the short-term storage caching layer, and hard disk drives (HDDs) for the long-term storage capacity layer. The hybrid HyperFlex system is an excellent choice for entry-level or midrange storage solutions, and hybrid solutions have been successfully deployed in many non-performance sensitive virtual environments. Meanwhile, there is significant growth in deployment of highly performance sensitive and mission critical applications. The primary challenge to the hybrid HyperFlex system from these highly performance sensitive applications, is their increased sensitivity to high storage latency. Due to the characteristics of the spinning hard disks, it is unavoidable that their higher latency becomes the bottleneck in the hybrid system. Ideally, if all of the storage operations were to occur in the caching SSD layer, the hybrid systemâs performance will be excellent. But in several scenarios, the amount of data being written and read exceeds the caching layer capacity, placing larger loads on the HDD capacity layer, and the subsequent increases in latency will naturally result in reduced performance.
Cisco All-Flash HyperFlex systems are an excellent option for customers with a requirement to support high performance, latency sensitive workloads. With a purpose built, flash-optimized and high-performance log-based filesystem, the Cisco All-Flash HyperFlex system provides:
Â·         Predictable high-performance across all the virtual machines on HyperFlex All-Flash.
Â·         Highly consistent and low latency, which benefits data-intensive applications and databases such as Microsoft SQL and Oracle.
Â·         Future ready architecture that is well suited for flash-memory configuration:
-         Cluster-wide SSD pooling maximizes performance and balances SSD usage so as to spread the wear.
-         A fully distributed log-structured filesystem optimizes the data path to help reduce write amplification.
-         Large sequential writing reduces flash wear and increases component longevity.
-         Inline space optimization, e.g. deduplication and compression, minimizes data operations and reduces wear.
Â·         Lower operating cost with the higher density drives for increased capacity of the system.
Â·         Cloud scale solution with easy scale-out and distributed infrastructure and the flexibility of scaling out independent resources separately.
Cisco HyperFlex support for hybrid and all-flash models now allows customers to choose the right platform configuration based on their capacity, applications, performance, and budget requirements. All-flash configurations offer repeatable and sustainable high performance, especially for scenarios with a larger working set of data, in other words, a large amount of data in motion. Hybrid configurations are a good option for customers who want the simplicity of the Cisco HyperFlex solution, but their needs focus on capacity-sensitive solutions, lower budgets, and fewer performance-sensitive applications.
Cisco HyperFlex Compute-Only Nodes
All current model Cisco UCS M4 and M5 generation servers, except the Cisco UCS C880 M4 and Cisco UCS C880 M5, may be used as compute-only nodes connected to a Cisco HyperFlex cluster, along with a limited number of previous M3 generation servers. Any valid CPU and memory configuration is allowed in the compute-only nodes, and the servers can be configured to boot from SAN, local disks, or internal SD cards. The following servers may be used as compute-only nodes:
Â·         Cisco UCS B200 M4 Blade Server
Â·         Cisco UCS B200 M5 Blade Server
Â·         Cisco UCS C220 M5 Rack-Mount Servers
Â·         Cisco UCS C240 M5 Rack-Mount Servers
Cisco HyperFlex Data Platform Software
The Cisco HyperFlex HX Data Platform is a purpose-built, high-performance, distributed file system with a wide array of enterprise-class data management services. The data platformâs innovations redefine distributed storage technology, exceeding the boundaries of first-generation hyperconverged infrastructures. The data platform has all the features expected in an enterprise shared storage system, eliminating the need to configure and maintain complex Fibre Channel storage networks and devices. The platform simplifies operations and helps ensure data availability. Enterprise-class storage features include the following:
Â·         Data protection creates multiple copies of the data across the cluster so that data availability is not affected if single or multiple components fail (depending on the replication factor configured).
Â·         Deduplication is always on, helping reduce storage requirements in virtualization clusters in which multiple operating system instances in guest virtual machines result in large amounts of replicated data.
Â·         Compression further reduces storage requirements, reducing costs, and the log-structured file system is designed to store variable-sized blocks, reducing internal fragmentation.
Â·         Thin provisioning allows large volumes to be created without requiring storage to support them until the need arises, simplifying data volume growth and making storage a âpay as you growâ proposition.
Â·         Fast, space-efficient clones rapidly duplicate virtual storage volumes so that virtual machines can be cloned simply through metadata operations, with actual data copied only for write operations.
Cisco HyperFlex Connect HTML5 Management Web Page
An all-new HTML 5 based Web UI is available for use as the primary management tool for Cisco HyperFlex. Through this centralized point of control for the cluster, administrators can create volumes, monitor the data platform health, and manage resource use. Administrators can also use this data to predict when the cluster will need to be scaled. To use the HyperFlex Connect UI, connect using a web browser to the HyperFlex cluster IP address: http://<hx controller cluster ip>.

Cisco Intersight Cloud Based Management
Cisco Intersight (https://intersight.com), previously known as Starship, is the latest visionary cloud-based management tool, designed to provide a centralized off-site management, monitoring and reporting tool for all of your Cisco UCS based solutions. In the initial release of Cisco Intersight, monitoring and reporting is enabled against Cisco HyperFlex clusters. The Cisco Intersight website and framework can be upgraded with new and enhanced features independently of the products that are managed, meaning that many new features and capabilities can come with no downtime or upgrades required by the end users. Future releases of Cisco HyperFlex will enable further functionality along with these upgrades to the Cisco Intersight framework. This unique combination of embedded and online technologies will result in a complete cloud-based management solution that can care for Cisco HyperFlex throughout the entire lifecycle, from deployment through retirement.

Cisco HyperFlex HX Data Platform Controller
A Cisco HyperFlex HX Data Platform controller resides on each node and implements the distributed file system. The controller runs as software in user space within a virtual machine, and intercepts and handles all I/O from the guest virtual machines. Dedicated CPU cores and memory allow the controller to deliver consistent performance without affecting performance of the other virtual machines in the cluster.
The data platform has modules to support the specific hypervisor or container platform in use. The controller accesses all of the nodeâs disk storage through hypervisor bypass mechanisms (Discrete Device Assignment feature in Windows Server 2016 Hyper-V) for excellent performance. It uses the nodeâs memory and dedicated SSD drives as part of a distributed caching layer, and it uses the nodeâs HDDs, or SSD drives for distributed storage. The controller VM exposes the distributed storage as SMB file share to each  Hyper-V node. The data platform controller interfaces with the hypervisor in two ways:
Â·         IOVisor: The data platform controller intercepts all I/O requests and routes them to the nodes responsible for storing or retrieving the blocks. The IOVisor makes the existence of the hyperconvergence layer transparent to the hypervisor.
Â·         Hypervisor agent: A module uses the hypervisor APIs to support advanced storage system operations such as snapshots and cloning. These are accessed through the hypervisor so that the hyperconvergence layer appears just as if it were enterprise shared storage. The controller accelerates operations by manipulating metadata rather than actual data copying, providing rapid response, and thus rapid deployment of new application environments.
Figure 16      Cisco HyperFlex Data Platform Controller Plugs into the Hypervisor in Each Node
Data Operations and Distribution
The Cisco HyperFlex HX Data Platform controllers handle all read and write operation requests from the guest virtual machines to their virtual disks (VHD/VHDX) stored in the distributed datastores in the cluster. The data platform distributes the data across multiple nodes of the cluster, and also across multiple capacity disks of each node, according to the replication level policy selected during the cluster setup. This method avoids storage hotspots on specific nodes, and on specific disks of the nodes, and thereby also avoids networking hotspots or congestion from accessing more data on some nodes versus others.
Replication Factor
The policy for the number of duplicate copies of each storage block is chosen during cluster setup and is referred to as the replication factor (RF).
Â·         Replication Factor 3: For every I/O write committed to the storage layer, 2 additional copies of the blocks written will be created and stored in separate locations, for a total of 3 copies of the blocks. Blocks are distributed in such a way as to ensure multiple copies of the blocks are not stored on the same disks, nor on the same nodes of the cluster. This setting can tolerate simultaneous failures of 2 entire nodes in a cluster of 5 nodes or greater, without losing data and resorting to restore from backup or other recovery processes. RF3 is recommended for all production systems.
Â·         Replication Factor 2: For every I/O write committed to the storage layer, 1 additional copy of the blocks written will be created and stored in separate locations, for a total of 2 copies of the blocks. Blocks are distributed in such a way as to ensure multiple copies of the blocks are not stored on the same disks, nor on the same nodes of the cluster. This setting can tolerate a failure of 1 entire node without losing data and resorting to restore from backup or other recovery processes. RF2 is suitable for non-production systems, or environments where the extra data protection is not needed.
Data Write and Compression Operations
Internally, the contents of each virtual disk are subdivided and spread across multiple servers by the HXDP software. For each write operation, the data is intercepted by the IO Visor module on the node where the virtual machine is running, a primary node is determined for that particular operation via a hashing algorithm, and then sent to the primary node via the network. The primary node compresses the data in real time, writes the compressed data to its caching SSD, and replica copies of that compressed data are written to the caching SSD of the remote nodes in the cluster, according to the replication factor setting. For example, at RF=3 a write will be written to the primary node for that virtual disk address, and two additional writes will be committed in parallel on two other nodes. Because the virtual disk contents have been divided and spread out via the hashing algorithm, this method results in all writes being spread across all nodes, avoiding the problems with data locality and ânoisyâ virtual machines consuming all the IO capacity of a single node. The write operation will not be acknowledged until all three copies are written to the caching layer SSDs. Written data is also cached in a write log area resident in memory in the controller virtual machine, along with the write log on the caching SSDs. This process speeds up read requests when reads are requested of data that has recently been written.
Data Destaging and Deduplication
The Cisco HyperFlex HX Data Platform constructs multiple write caching segments on the caching SSDs of each node in the distributed cluster. As write cache segments become full and based on policies accounting for I/O load and access patterns, those write cache segments are locked and new writes roll over to a new write cache segment. The data in the now locked cache segment is destaged to the HDD capacity layer of the nodes for the Hybrid system or to the SDD capacity layer of the nodes for the All-Flash system. During the destaging process, data is deduplicated before being written to the capacity storage layer, and the resulting data can now be written to the HDDs or SDDs of the server. On hybrid systems, the now deduplicated and compressed data is also written to the dedicated read cache area of the caching SSD, which speeds up read requests of data that has recently been written. When the data is destaged to an HDD, it is written in a single sequential operation, avoiding disk head seek thrashing on the spinning disks and accomplishing the task in the minimal amount of time. Since the data is already deduplicated and compressed before being written, the platform avoids additional I/O overhead often seen on competing systems, which must later do a read/dedupe/compress/write cycle. Deduplication, compression and destaging take place with no delays or I/O penalties to the guest virtual machines making requests to read or write data, which benefits both the HDD and SDD configurations.
Figure 17      HyperFlex HX Data Platform Data Movement
Data Read Operations
For data read operations, data may be read from multiple locations. For data that was very recently written, the data is likely to still exist in the write log of the local platform controller memory, or the write log of the local caching layer disk. If local write logs do not contain the data, the distributed filesystem metadata will be queried to see if the data is cached elsewhere, either in write logs of remote nodes, or in the dedicated read cache area of the local and remote caching SSDs of hybrid nodes. Finally, if the data has not been accessed in a significant amount of time, the filesystem will retrieve the requested data from the distributed capacity layer. As requests for reads are made to the distributed filesystem and the data is retrieved from the capacity layer, the caching SSDs of hybrid nodes populate their dedicated read cache area to speed up subsequent requests for the same data. This multi-tiered distributed system with several layers of caching techniques, ensures that data is served at the highest possible speed, leveraging the caching SSDs of the nodes fully and equally.  All-flash configurations, however, do not employ a dedicated read cache because such caching does not provide any performance benefit; the persistent data copy already resides on high-performance SSDs.
In summary, the Cisco HyperFlex HX Data Platform implements a distributed, log-structured file system that performs data operations via two configurations:
Â·         In a Hybrid configuration, the data platform provides a caching layer using SSDs to accelerate read requests and write responses, and it implements a storage capacity layer using HDDs.
Â·         In an All-Flash configuration, the data platform provides a dedicated caching layer using high endurance SSDs to accelerate write responses, and it implements a storage capacity layer also using SSDs. Read requests are fulfilled directly from the capacity SSDs, as a dedicated read cache is not needed to accelerate read operations.

Licensing
Cisco HyperFlex systems must be properly licensed using Cisco Smart Licensing, which is a cloud-based software licensing management solution used to automate many manuals, time consuming and error prone licensing tasks. Cisco HyperFlex 2.5 and later communicate with the Cisco Smart Software Manager (CSSM) online service via a Cisco Smart Account, to check out or assign available licenses from the account to the Cisco HyperFlex cluster resources. Communications can be direct via the internet, they can be configured to communicate via a proxy server, or they can communicate with an internal Cisco Smart Software Manager satellite server, which caches and periodically synchronizes licensing data. In a small number of highly secure environments, systems can be provisioned with a Permanent License Reservation (PLR) which does not need to communicate with CSSM. Contact your Cisco sales representative or partner to discuss if your security requirements will necessitate use of these permanent licenses. New HyperFlex cluster installations will operate for 90 days without licensing as an evaluation period, thereafter the system will generate alarms and operate in a non-compliant mode. Systems without compliant licensing will not be entitled to technical support.
For more information about the Cisco Smart Software Manager satellite server, see: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/buy/smart-accounts/software-manager-satellite.html
          Beginning with Cisco HyperFlex 3.0, licensing the system requires one license per node: Standard license.

Special care must be taken not to alter the revision of the hypervisor, Active Directory server, Cisco HX platform software, or the Cisco UCS firmware without first consulting the appropriate release notes and compatibility matrixes to ensure that the system is not being modified into an unsupported configuration.
          The UBR # should be greater than 1884 for Windows Server 2016 and 107 for Windows Server 2019. If not, upgrade the Hyper-V servers to the latest version.
          The remote management server should also have a version UBR # greater than 1884 and 107 for Windows Server 2019. You must upgrade the Hyper-V management server if the version is 1884 or lower.
To find out the Windows server version on the Hyper-V host for HyperFlex, run one of the following commands:
1.    Type âwinverâ in the run command.
2.    Open PowerShell and run the following command:
Get-ItemProperty 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion' | select ProductName,ReleaseID,CurrentBuild,CurrentBuildNumber,UBR
Microsoft Windows Active Directory
The Microsoft Windows Active Directory 2012 or later is required due to the requirement of Cisco HyperFlex for Microsoft Hyper-V. The Active Directory with integrated DNS server must be installed and operational prior to the installation of the Cisco HyperFlex HX Data Platform software. The following best practice guidance applies to installations of HyperFlex 4.0:
Â·         Do not modify the default TCP port settings. Using non-standard ports can lead to failures during the installation.
Â·         It is recommended to build the Microsoft Active Directory Domain Controller and DNS servers on a physical server or in a virtual environment outside of the HyperFlex cluster. Building the Microsoft Active Directory Domain Controller and DNS servers as a virtual machine inside the HyperFlex cluster environment is highly discouraged as it creates cyclic dependency.
Â·         Avoid creating single point of failure when you plan your virtual domain controller deployment
-         Run at least two virtualized domain controllers per domain on different virtualization hosts, which reduces the risk of losing all domain controllers if a single virtualization host fails.
-         Maintain physical domain controllers in each of your domains. This mitigates the risk of a virtualization platform malfunction that affects all host systems that use that platform.

https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/techpaper/Virtualizing_Windows_Active_Directory.pdf
          This document does not explain the installation and configuration of Microsoft Windows Active Directory and DNS server and assumes it to be available at the customer site up and running.
 Scale
Cisco HyperFlex for Microsoft Hyper-V standard clusters currently scale from a minimum of 3 to a maximum of 8 Cisco HX-series converged nodes with small form factor (SFF) disks per cluster. A converged node is a member of the cluster which provides storage resources to the HX Distributed Filesystem. Once the maximum size of a single cluster has been reached, the environment can be âscaled outâ by adding additional HX model servers to the Cisco UCS domain, installing an additional HyperFlex cluster on them, and controlling them via the same management host with PowerShell and RSAT tools installed.
          At the time of the publication of this document, Cisco HyperFlex for Microsoft Hyper-V does not support Cisco UCS M4 server models and SED drives.

          HyperFlex on Hyper-V supports a maximum of 32 nodes (16 Converged nodes + 16 Compute-Only nodes) in a cluster, it is recommended to create smaller clusters for the following reasons; creates smaller failure domains, a single big cluster is always a challenge to update/upgrade, allows room for expansion in the future, and easier to manage and operate.
Capacity
Overall usable cluster capacity is based on a number of factors. The number of nodes in the cluster, the number and size of the capacity layer disks, and the replication factor of the HyperFlex HX Data Platform, all affect the cluster capacity.
Disk drive manufacturers have adopted a size reporting methodology using calculation by powers of 10, also known as decimal prefix. As an example, a 120 GB disk is listed with a minimum of 120 x 10^9 bytes of usable addressable capacity, or 120 billion bytes. However, many operating systems and filesystems report their space based on standard computer binary exponentiation, or calculation by powers of 2, also called binary prefix. In this example, 2^10 or 1024 bytes make up a kilobyte, 2^10 kilobytes make up a megabyte, 2^10 megabytes make up a gigabyte, and 2^10 gigabytes make up a terabyte. As the values increase, the disparity between the two systems of measurement and notation get worse, at the terabyte level, the deviation between a decimal prefix value and a binary prefix value is nearly 10 percent.
The International System of Units (SI) defines values and decimal prefix by powers of 10 as follows:

For the purpose of this document, the decimal prefix numbers are used only for raw disk capacity as listed by the respective manufacturers. For all calculations where raw or usable capacities are shown from the perspective of the HyperFlex software, filesystems or operating systems, the binary prefix numbers are used. This is done primarily to show a consistent set of values as seen by the end user from within the HyperFlex Connect GUI when viewing cluster capacity, allocation, and consumption, and also within most operating systems.
Table 12  lists a set of HyperFlex HX Data Platform cluster usable capacity values, using binary prefix, for an array of cluster configurations. These values provide an example of the capacity calculations, for determining the appropriate size of HX cluster to initially purchase, and how much capacity can be gained by adding capacity disks. The calculations for these values are listed in Appendix A: Cluster Capacity Calculations.

Physical Topology
Topology Overview
The Cisco HyperFlex for Microsoft Hyper-V system is composed of a pair of Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects along with up to sixteen HX-Series rack-mount servers as converged nodes per cluster. Up to sixteen compute-only servers can also be added per HyperFlex cluster. Adding Cisco UCS rack-mount servers and/or Cisco UCS 5108 Blade chassis, which house Cisco UCS blade servers, allows for additional compute resources in an extended cluster design. Up to eight separate HX clusters can be installed under a single pair of Fabric Interconnects. The two Fabric Interconnects both connect to every HX-Series rack-mount server, and both connect to every Cisco UCS 5108 blade chassis, and Cisco UCS rack-mount server. Upstream network connections, also referred to as ânorthboundâ network connections are made from the Fabric Interconnects to the customer data center network at the time of installation.
Figure 18     HyperFlex Standard Cluster Topology
Figure 19     HyperFlex Extended Cluster Topology
Fabric Interconnects
Fabric Interconnects (FI) are deployed in pairs, wherein the two units operate as a management cluster, while forming two separate network fabrics, referred to as the A side and B side fabrics. Therefore, many design elements will refer to FI A or FI B, alternatively called fabric A or fabric B. Both Fabric Interconnects are active at all times, passing data on both network fabrics for a redundant and highly available configuration. Management services, including Cisco UCS Manager, are also provided by the two FIs but in a clustered manner, where one FI is the primary, and one is secondary, with a roaming clustered IP address. This primary/secondary relationship is only for the management cluster and has no effect on data transmission.
Fabric Interconnects have the following ports, which must be connected for proper management of the Cisco UCS domain:
Â·         Mgmt: A 10/100/1000 Mbps port for managing the Fabric Interconnect and the Cisco UCS domain using GUI and CLI tools. This port is also used by remote KVM, IPMI and SoL sessions to the managed servers within the domain. This is typically connected to the customer management network.
Â·         L1: A cross connect port for forming the Cisco UCS management cluster. This port is connected directly to the L1 port of the paired Fabric Interconnect using a standard CAT5 or CAT6 Ethernet cable with RJ45 plugs. It is not necessary to connect this to a switch or hub.
Â·         L2: A cross connect port for forming the Cisco UCS management cluster. This port is connected directly to the L2 port of the paired Fabric Interconnect using a standard CAT5 or CAT6 Ethernet cable with RJ45 plugs. It is not necessary to connect this to a switch or hub.
Â·         Console: An RJ45 serial port for direct console access to the Fabric Interconnect. This port is typically used during the initial FI setup process with the included serial to RJ45 adapter cable. This can also be plugged into a terminal aggregator or remote console server device.
HX-Series Rack-Mount Servers
The HX-Series converged servers are connected directly to the Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects in Direct Connect mode. This option enables Cisco UCS Manager to manage the HX-Series Rack-Mount Servers using a single cable for both management traffic and data traffic. Cisco HyperFlex M5 generation servers can be configured only with the Cisco VIC 1387 card. The standard and redundant connection practice is to connect port 1 of the VIC card (the right-hand port) to a port on FI A, and port 2 of the VIC card (the left-hand port) to a port on FI B (Table 13  ). The HyperFlex installer checks for this configuration, and that all serversâ cabling matches. Failure to follow this cabling practice can lead to errors, discovery failures, and loss of redundant connectivity.
Various combinations of physical connectivity between the Cisco HX-series servers and the Fabric Interconnects are possible, but only specific combinations are supported. For example, use of the Cisco QSA module to convert a 40 GbE QSFP+ port into a 10 GbE SFP+ port is allowed for M5 generation servers in order to configure M5 generation servers along with model 6248 or 6296 Fabric Interconnects. Table 13  lists the possible connections, and which of these methods is supported.

Cisco UCS B-Series Blade Servers
HyperFlex extended clusters also incorporate 1-16 Cisco UCS blade servers for additional compute capacity. The blade chassis comes populated with 1-4 power supplies, and 8 modular cooling fans. In the rear of the chassis are two bays for installation of Cisco Fabric Extenders. The Fabric Extenders (also commonly called IO Modules, or IOMs) connect the chassis to the Fabric Interconnects. Internally, the Fabric Extenders connect to the Cisco VIC card installed in each blade server across the chassis backplane. The standard connection practice is to connect 1-8 10 GbE links, or 1-4 40 GbE links (depending on the IOMs and FIs purchased) from the left-side IOM, or IOM 1, to FI A, and to connect the same number of 10 GbE or 40 GbE links from the right-side IOM, or IOM 2, to FI B (Figure 21). All other cabling configurations are invalid, and can lead to errors, discovery failures, and loss of redundant connectivity.
Figure 21     Cisco UCS 5108 Chassis Connectivity
  Cisco UCS C-Series Rack-Mount Servers
HyperFlex extended clusters also incorporate 1-32 Cisco UCS Rack-Mount Servers for additional compute capacity. The Cisco UCS C-Series Rack-Mount Servers are connected directly to the Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects in Direct Connect mode. Internally the Cisco UCS C-Series servers are configured with the Cisco VIC 1227 or Cisco VIC 1387 network interface card (NIC) installed in a modular LAN on motherboard (MLOM) slot, which has dual 10 Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) ports or 40 Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) ports. The standard and redundant connection practice is to connect port 1 of the VIC card to a port on FI A, and port 2 of the VIC card to a port on FI B. Failure to follow this cabling practice can lead to errors, discovery failures, and loss of redundant connectivity.

Logical Topology
Logical Network Design
The Cisco HyperFlex system has communication pathways that fall into four defined zones (Figure 23):
Â·         Management Zone: This zone comprises the connections needed to manage the physical hardware, the hypervisor hosts, and the storage platform controller virtual machines (SCVM). These interfaces and IP addresses need to be available to all staff who will administer the HX system, throughout the LAN/WAN. This zone must provide access to Domain Name System (DNS) and Network Time Protocol (NTP) services and allow Secure Shell (SSH) communication. In this zone are multiple physical and virtual components:
-         Fabric Interconnect management ports.
-         Cisco UCS external management interfaces used by the servers, which answer via the FI management ports.
-         Hyper-V host management interfaces.
-         Storage Controller virtual machine management interfaces.
-         A roaming HX cluster management interface.
-         Storage Controller virtual machine Management interfaces.
Â·         VM Zone: This zone comprises the connections needed to service network IO to the guest virtual machines that will run inside the HyperFlex hyperconverged system. This zone typically contains multiple VLANs that are trunked to the Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects via the network uplinks and tagged with 802.1Q VLAN IDs. These interfaces and IP addresses need to be available to all staff and other computer endpoints which need to communicate with the guest virtual machines in the HX system, throughout the LAN/WAN.
Â·         Storage Zone: This zone comprises the connections used by the Cisco HX Data Platform software, Hyper-V hosts, and the storage controller virtual machines to service the HX Distributed Data Filesystem. These interfaces and IP addresses need to be able to communicate with each other at all times for proper operation. During normal operation, this traffic all occurs within the Cisco UCS domain, however there are hardware failure scenarios where this traffic would need to traverse the network northbound of the Cisco UCS domain. For that reason, the VLAN used for HX storage traffic must be able to traverse the network uplinks from the Cisco UCS domain, reaching FI A from FI B, and vice-versa. This zone is primarily jumbo frame traffic therefore jumbo frames must be enabled on the Cisco UCS uplinks. In this zone are multiple components:
-         A teamed interface is used for storage traffic on each Hyper-V host in the HX cluster.
-         Storage Controller virtual machine storage interfaces.
-         A roaming HX cluster storage interface.
Â·         Live Migration Zone: This zone comprises the connections used by the Hyper-V hosts to enable live migration of the guest virtual machines from host to host. During normal operation, this traffic all occurs within the Cisco UCS domain, however there are hardware failure scenarios where this traffic would need to traverse the network northbound of the Cisco UCS domain. For that reason, the VLAN used for HX live migration traffic must be able to traverse the network uplinks from the Cisco UCS domain, reaching FI A from FI B, and vice-versa.
Figure 23 and Figure 24 illustrates the logical network design at the HX node and cluster level.

Design Elements
Installing the HyperFlex system is primarily done through a deployable HyperFlex installer virtual machine, available for download at cisco.com as an OVA file. The installer virtual machine performs most of the Cisco UCS configuration work, it can be leveraged to simplify the installation of Windows Server 2016 on the HyperFlex hosts, and also performs significant portions of the configuration. Finally, the installer virtual machine is used to install the HyperFlex HX Data Platform software and create the HyperFlex cluster. Because this simplified installation method has been developed by Cisco, this CVD will not give detailed manual steps for the configuration of all the elements that are handled by the installer. Instead, the elements configured will be described and documented in this section, and the subsequent sections will guide you through the manual steps needed for installation, and how to utilize the HyperFlex Installer for the remaining configuration steps.
Network Design
Cisco UCS Uplink Connectivity
Cisco UCS network uplinks connect ânorthboundâ from the pair of Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects to the LAN in the customer datacenter. All Cisco UCS uplinks operate as trunks, carrying multiple 802.1Q VLAN IDs across the uplinks. The default Cisco UCS behavior is to assume that all VLAN IDs defined in the Cisco UCS configuration are eligible to be trunked across all available uplinks.
Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects appear on the network as a collection of endpoints versus another network switch. Internally, the Fabric Interconnects do not participate in spanning-tree protocol (STP) domains, and the Fabric Interconnects cannot form a network loop, as they are not connected to each other with a layer 2 Ethernet link. All link up/down decisions via STP will be made by the upstream root bridges.
Uplinks need to be connected and active from both Fabric Interconnects. For redundancy, multiple uplinks can be used on each FI, either as 802.3ad Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) port-channels or using individual links. For the best level of performance and redundancy, uplinks can be made as LACP port-channels to multiple upstream Cisco switches using the virtual port channel (vPC) feature. Using vPC uplinks allows all uplinks to be active passing data, plus protects against any individual link failure, and the failure of an upstream switch. Other uplink configurations can be redundant, but spanning-tree protocol loop avoidance may disable links if vPC is not available.
All uplink connectivity methods must allow for traffic to pass from one Fabric Interconnect to the other, or from fabric A to fabric B. There are scenarios where cable, port or link failures would require traffic that normally does not leave the Cisco UCS domain, to now be forced over the Cisco UCS uplinks. Additionally, this traffic flow pattern can be seen briefly during maintenance procedures, such as updating firmware on the Fabric Interconnects, which requires them to be rebooted. The following section detail the uplink connectivity option used for this solution.
vPC to Multiple Switches
This recommended connection design relies on using Cisco switches that have the virtual port channel feature, such as Catalyst 6000 series switches running VSS, Cisco Nexus 5000 series, and Cisco Nexus 9000 series switches. Logically the two vPC enabled switches appear as one, and therefore spanning-tree protocol will not block any links. This configuration allows for all links to be active, achieving maximum bandwidth potential, and multiple redundancy at each level.
Figure 25     Connectivity with vPC
VLANs and Subnets
For the base HyperFlex system configuration, multiple VLANs need to be carried to the Cisco UCS domain from the upstream LAN, and these VLANs are also defined in the Cisco UCS configuration. The hx-storage-data VLAN must be a separate VLAN ID from the remaining VLANs. Table 16  lists the VLANs created by the HyperFlex installer in Cisco UCS, and their functions:

            A dedicated network or subnet for physical device management is often used in data centers. In this scenario, the mgmt0 interfaces of the two Fabric Interconnects would be connected to that dedicated network or subnet. This is a valid configuration for HyperFlex installations with the following caveat; wherever the HyperFlex installer is deployed it must have IP connectivity to the subnet of the mgmt0 interfaces of the Fabric Interconnects, and also have IP connectivity to the subnets used by the hx-inband-mgmt VLANs listed above.
Jumbo Frames
All HyperFlex storage traffic traversing the hx-storage-data VLAN and subnet is configured by default to use jumbo frames, or to be precise, all communication is configured to send IP packets with a Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) size of 9000 bytes. In addition, the default MTU for the hx-livemigrate VLAN is also set to use jumbo frames. Using a larger MTU value means that each IP packet sent carries a larger payload, therefore transmitting more data per packet, and consequently sending and receiving data faster. This configuration also means that the Cisco UCS uplinks must be configured to pass jumbo frames. Failure to configure the Cisco UCS uplink switches to allow jumbo frames can lead to service interruptions during some failure scenarios, including Cisco UCS firmware upgrades, or when a cable or port failure would cause storage traffic to traverse the northbound Cisco UCS uplink switches.
HyperFlex clusters can be configured to use standard size frames of 1500 bytes, however Cisco recommends that this configuration only be used in environments where the Cisco UCS uplink switches are not capable of passing jumbo frames, and that jumbo frames be enabled in all other situations.
Cisco UCS Design
This section describes the elements within Cisco UCS Manager that are configured by the Cisco HyperFlex installer. Many of the configuration elements are fixed in nature, meanwhile the HyperFlex installer does allow for some items to be specified at the time of creation, for example VLAN names and IDs, external management IP pools and more. Where the elements can be manually set during the installation, those items will be noted in << >> brackets.
Cisco UCS Organization
During the HyperFlex installation a new Cisco UCS Sub-Organization is created. You must specify a unique Sub-Organization name for each cluster during the installation, for example âhx1hybridâ, or âhx2sedâ. The sub-organization is created underneath the root level of the Cisco UCS hierarchy, and is used to contain all policies, pools, templates, and service profiles used by HyperFlex, which prevents problems from overlapping settings across policies and pools. This arrangement also allows for organizational control using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and administrative locales within Cisco UCS Manager at a later time if desired. In this way, control can be granted to administrators of only the HyperFlex specific elements of the Cisco UCS domain, separate from control of root level elements or elements in other sub-organizations.
Figure 26     Cisco UCS HyperFlex Sub-Organization
Cisco UCS LAN Policies
QoS System Classes
Specific Cisco UCS Quality of Service (QoS) system classes are defined for a Cisco HyperFlex system. These classes define Class of Service (CoS) values that can be used by the uplink switches north of the Cisco UCS domain, plus which classes are active, along with whether packet drop is allowed, the relative weight of the different classes when there is contention, the maximum transmission unit (MTU) size, and if there is multicast optimization applied. QoS system classes are defined for the entire Cisco UCS domain, the classes that are enabled can later be used in QoS policies, which are then assigned to Cisco UCS vNICs. Table 17  and Figure 27 list the QoS System Class settings configured for HyperFlex:

QoS Policies
In order to apply the settings defined in the Cisco UCS QoS System Classes, specific QoS Policies must be created, and then assigned to the vNICs, or vNIC templates used in Cisco UCS Service Profiles.

VLANs are created by the HyperFlex installer to support a base HyperFlex system, with a VLAN for live migrate, and a single or multiple VLANs defined for guest virtual machine traffic. Names and IDs for the VLANs are defined in the Cisco UCS configuration page of the HyperFlex installer web interface. The VLANs listed in Cisco UCS must already be present on the upstream network, and the Cisco UCS FIs do not participate in VLAN Trunk Protocol (VTP). Table 20  and Figure 29 list the VLANs configured for HyperFlex.

Management IP Address Pool
A Cisco UCS Management IP Address Pool must be populated with a block of IP addresses. These IP addresses are assigned to the Cisco Integrated Management Controller (CIMC) interface of the rack mount and blade servers that are managed in the Cisco UCS domain. The IP addresses are the communication endpoints for various functions, such as remote KVM, virtual media, Serial over LAN (SoL), and Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) for each rack mount or blade server. Therefore, a minimum of one IP address per physical server in the domain must be provided. The IP addresses are considered to be an âout-of-bandâ address, meaning that the communication pathway uses the Fabric Interconnectsâ mgmt0 ports, which answer ARP requests for the management addresses. Because of this arrangement, the IP addresses in this pool must be in the same IP subnet as the IP addresses assigned to the Fabric Interconnectsâ mgmt0 ports. A new IP pool, named âhx-ext-mgmtâ is created in the HyperFlex sub-organization, and populated with a block of IP addresses, a subnet mask, and a default gateway by the HyperFlex installer.
Figure 30     Management IP Address Pool
MAC Address Pools
One of the core benefits of the Cisco UCS and Virtual Interface Card (VIC) technology is the assignment of the personality of the card via Cisco UCS Service Profiles. The number of virtual NIC (vNIC) interfaces, their VLAN associations, MAC addresses, QoS policies and more are all applied dynamically as part of the service profile association process. Media Access Control (MAC) addresses use 6 bytes of data as a unique address to identify the interface on the layer 2 network. All devices are assigned a unique MAC address, which is ultimately used for all data transmission and reception. The Cisco UCS and VIC technology picks a MAC address from a pool of addresses and assigns it to each vNIC defined in the service profile when that service profile is created.
Best practices mandate that MAC addresses used for Cisco UCS domains use 00:25:B5 as the first three bytes, which is one of the Organizationally Unique Identifiers (OUI) registered to Cisco Systems, Inc. The fourth byte (e.g. 00:25:B5:xx) is specified during the HyperFlex installation. The fifth byte is set automatically by the HyperFlex installer, to correlate to the Cisco UCS fabric and the vNIC placement order. Finally, the last byte is incremented according to the number of MAC addresses created in the pool. To avoid overlaps, when you define the values in the HyperFlex installer you must ensure that the first four bytes of the MAC address pools are unique for each HyperFlex cluster installed in the same layer 2 network, and also different from MAC address pools in other Cisco UCS domains which may exist.
Table 21  lists the MAC Address Pools configured for HyperFlex and their default assignment to the vNIC templates created.

Network Control Policies
Cisco UCS Network Control Policies control various aspects of the behavior of vNICs defined in the Cisco UCS Service Profiles. Settings controlled include enablement of Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP), MAC address registration, MAC address forging, and the action taken on the vNIC status if the Cisco UCS network uplinks are failed. Two policies are configured by the HyperFlex Installer, HyperFlex-infra is applied to the âinfrastructureâ vNIC interfaces of the HyperFlex system, and HyperFlex-vm, which is only applied to the vNIC interfaces carrying guest virtual machine traffic. This allows for more flexibility, even though the policies are currently configured with the same settings. Table 22  details the Network Control Policies configured for HyperFlex, and their default assignment to the vNIC templates created:

vNIC Templates
Cisco UCS Manager has a feature to configure vNIC templates, which can be used to simplify and speed up configuration efforts. VNIC templates are referenced in service profiles and LAN connectivity policies, versus configuring the same vNICs individually in each service profile, or service profile template. VNIC templates contain all the configuration elements that make up a vNIC, including VLAN assignment, MAC address pool selection, fabric A or B assignment, fabric failover, MTU, QoS policy, Network Control Policy, and more. Templates are created as either initial templates or updating templates. Updating templates retain a link between the parent template and the child object, therefore when changes are made to the template, the changes are propagated to all remaining linked child objects. An additional feature named âvNIC Redundancyâ allows vNICs to be configured in pairs, so that the settings of one vNIC template, designated as a primary template, will automatically be applied to a configured secondary template. For all HyperFlex vNIC templates, the âAâ side vNIC template is configured as a primary template, and the related âBâ side vNIC template is a secondary. In each case, the only configuration difference between the two templates is which fabric they are configured to connect through. The following tables list the initial settings in each of the vNIC templates created by the HyperFlex installer:

LAN Connectivity Policies
Cisco UCS Manager has a feature for LAN Connectivity Policies, which aggregates all of the vNICs or vNIC templates desired for a service profile configuration into a single policy definition. This simplifies configuration efforts by defining a collection of vNICs or vNIC templates once and using that policy in the service profiles or service profile templates. The HyperFlex installer configures a LAN Connectivity Policy named HyperFlex, which contains all of the vNIC templates defined in the previous section, along with an Adapter Policy named HyperFlex, also configured by the HyperFlex installer. Table 24  lists the LAN Connectivity Policy configured for HyperFlex:

Cisco UCS Servers Policies
Adapter Policies
Cisco UCS Adapter Policies are used to configure various settings of the Converged Network Adapter (CNA) installed in the Cisco UCS blade or rack-mount servers. Various advanced hardware features can be enabled or disabled depending on the software or operating system being used. The following figures detail the Adapter Policy named âHyperFlexâ configured for HyperFlex.
Figure 33      Cisco UCS Adapter Policy Resources
Figure 34     Cisco UCS Adapter Policy Options
BIOS Policies
Cisco HX-Series M5 generation servers no longer use pre-defined BIOS setting defaults derived from Cisco UCS Manager, instead the servers have default BIOS tokens set from the factory. The current default token settings can be viewed at the following website: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/ucs-manager/Reference-Docs/Server-BIOS-Tokens/3-2/b_UCS_BIOS_Tokens.html
A BIOS policy, named âHyperFlex-m5â is created by the HyperFlex installer to modify the setting of M5 generation servers. The settings modified are as follows:
Â·         System altitude is set to âAutoâ
Â·         CPU performance is set to âHPCâ
Â·         Processor C1E state is set to âDisabledâ
Â·         Power Technology is set to âPerformanceâ
Â·         Energy Performance is set to âPerformanceâ
Â·         Serial Port A is enabled
Â·         Console Redirection is set to Serial Port A
Boot Policies
Cisco UCS Boot Policies define the boot devices used by rack-mount servers, and the order that they are attempted to boot from. Cisco HX-Series M5 generation rack-mount servers have their Hyper-V  hypervisors installed to an internal M.2 SSD boot drive, therefore they require a unique boot policy defining that the servers should boot from that location. The HyperFlex installer configures a boot policy named âHyperFlex-m5â specifying boot from the M.2 SSDs, referred to as âEmbedded Diskâ which is used by the HyperFlex M5 converged nodes, and should not be modified.
Figure 35 details the HyperFlex Boot Policies for Cisco HX-Series M5 generation rack-mount servers.
Figure 35     Cisco UCS M5 Boot Policy
Host Firmware Packages
Cisco UCS Host Firmware Packages represent one of the most powerful features of the Cisco UCS platform; the ability to control the firmware revision of all the managed blades and rack-mount servers via a policy specified in the service profile. Host Firmware Packages are defined and referenced in the service profiles. Once a service profile is associated to a server, the firmware of all the components defined in the Host Firmware Package are automatically upgraded or downgraded to match the package. The HyperFlex installer creates a Host Firmware Packages named âHyperFlex-m5â which use the simple package definition method, applying firmware revisions to all components that matches a specific Cisco UCS firmware bundle, versus defining the firmware revisions part by part. Figure 36 shows the Host Firmware Package configured by the HyperFlex installer for Cisco HX-Series M5 generation rack-mount servers.
Figure 36     Cisco UCS M5 Host Firmware Package
Local Disk Configuration Policies
Cisco UCS Local Disk Configuration Policies are used to define the configuration of disks installed locally within each blade or rack-mount server, most often to configure Redundant Array of Independent/Inexpensive Disks (RAID levels) when multiple disks are present for data protection. Since HX-Series converged nodes providing storage resources do not require RAID, the HyperFlex installer creates a Local Disk Configuration Policies, named âHyperFlex-m5â which allows any local disk configuration. The policy named âHyperFlex-m5â is used by the service profile template named âhx-nodes-m5â, which is for the HyperFlex M5 generation converged servers, and should not be modified.
Figure 37 shows the Local Disk Configuration Policies configured by the HyperFlex installer.
Figure 37     Cisco UCS M5 Local Disk Configuration Policy
Maintenance Policies
Cisco UCS Maintenance Policies define the behavior of the attached blades and rack-mount servers when changes are made to the associated service profiles. The default Cisco UCS Maintenance Policy setting is âImmediateâ meaning that any change to a service profile that requires a reboot of the physical server will result in an immediate reboot of that server. The Cisco best practice is to use a Maintenance Policy set to âuser-ackâ, which requires a secondary acknowledgement by a user with the appropriate rights within Cisco UCS Manager, before the server is rebooted to apply the changes. The HyperFlex installer creates a Maintenance Policy named âHyperFlexâ with the setting changed to âuser-ackâ. In addition, the On Next Boot setting is enabled, which will automatically apply changes the next time the server is rebooted, without any secondary acknowledgement. Figure 38 shows the Maintenance Policy configured by the HyperFlex installer:
Figure 38      Cisco UCS Maintenance Policy
Power Control Policies
Cisco UCS Power Control Policies allow administrators to set priority values for power application to servers in environments where power supply may be limited, during times when the servers demand more power than is available. The HyperFlex installer creates a Power Control Policy named âHyperFlexâ with all power capping disabled, and fans allowed to run at full speed when necessary. Figure 39 shows the Power Control Policy configured by the HyperFlex installer.
Figure 39      Cisco UCS Power Control Policy
Scrub Policies
Cisco UCS Scrub Policies are used to scrub, or erase data from local disks, BIOS settings and FlexFlash SD cards. If the policy settings are enabled, the information is wiped when the service profile using the policy is disassociated from the server. The HyperFlex installer creates a Scrub Policy named âHyperFlexâ which has all settings disabled, therefore all data on local disks, SD cards and BIOS settings will be preserved if a service profile is disassociated. Figure 40 shows the Scrub Policy configured by the HyperFlex installer.
Figure 40     Cisco UCS Scrub Policy
Serial over LAN Policies
Cisco UCS Serial over LAN (SoL) Policies enable console output which is sent to the serial port of the server, to be accessible via the LAN. For many Linux based operating systems, such as VMware ESXi, the local serial port can be configured as a local console, where users can watch the system boot, and communicate with the system command prompt interactively. Since many blade servers do not have physical serial ports, and often administrators are working remotely, the ability to send and receive that traffic via the LAN is very helpful. Connections to a SoL session can be initiated from Cisco UCS Manager. The HyperFlex installer creates a SoL named âHyperFlexâ to enable SoL sessions and uses this feature to configure the ESXi hostsâ management networking configuration. Figure 41 shows the SoL Policy configured by the HyperFlex installer:
Figure 41     Cisco UCS Serial over LAN Policy
vMedia Policies
Cisco UCS Virtual Media (vMedia) Policies automate the connection of virtual media files to the remote KVM session of the Cisco UCS blades and rack-mount servers. Using a vMedia policy can speed up installation time by automatically attaching an installation ISO file to the server, without having to manually launch the remote KVM console and connect them one-by-one. The HyperFlex installer creates a vMedia Policy named âHyperFlexâ for future use, with no media locations defined.
Cisco UCS Service Profile Templates
Cisco UCS Manager has a feature to configure service profile templates, which can be used to simplify and speed up configuration efforts when the same configuration needs to be applied to multiple servers. Service profile templates are used to spawn multiple service profile copies to associate with a group of servers, versus configuring the same service profile manually each time it is needed. Service profile templates contain all the configuration elements that make up a service profile, including vNICs, vHBAs, local disk configurations, boot policies, host firmware packages, BIOS policies and more. Templates are created as either initial templates or updating templates. Updating templates retain a link between the parent template and the child object, therefore when changes are made to the template, the changes are propagated to all remaining linked child objects. The HyperFlex installer creates a service profile templates, named âhx-nodes-m5â. The following tables list the service profile template configured by the HyperFlex installer.

Microsoft Hyper-V Host Design
The following sections detail the design of the elements within the Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisors, system requirements, virtual networking, and the configuration of Hyper-V for the Cisco HyperFlex HX Distributed Data Platform.
Virtual Networking Design
The Cisco HyperFlex system has a pre-defined virtual network design at the Hyper-V hypervisor level. Four different virtual switches are created by the HyperFlex installer, each using two uplinks, which are each serviced by a vNIC defined in the Cisco UCS service profile.
The vSwitches created are:
Â·         vswitch-hx-inband-mgmt: This vSwitch is created as part of the automated installation. As shown in the below figure, it is configured to use a teamed interface named âteam-hx-inband-mgmtâ with âhv-mgmt-aâ and âhv-mgmt-bâ as member adapters, without jumbo frames. The teaming and load balancing mode are configured for âSwitch Independentâ and âHyper-V Portâ respectively with âhv-mgmt-bâ as Standby adapter. The management interfaces of Hyper-V host and Storage Platform Controller virtual machines connect to this vSwitch. The VLANs are not Native VLANs as assigned to the vNIC templates, and therefore they are defined in Hyper-V virtual switch manager.
Â·         vswitch-hx-storage-data: This vSwitch is created as part of the automated installation. As shown in the below figure, it is configured to use a teamed interface named âteam-hx-storage-dataâ with âstorage-data-aâ and âstorage-data-bâ as member adapters, with jumbo frames highly recommended. The teaming and load balancing mode are configured for âSwitch Independentâ and âHyper-V Portâ respectively with âstorage-data -bâ adapter in Standby mode. The storage interfaces of Hyper-V host connected to this vSwitch is used for connecting to the HX Datastore via SMB. The VLANs are not Native VLANs as assigned to the vNIC templates, and therefore they are defined in Hyper-V virtual switch manager.
Â·         vswitch-hx-vm-network: This vSwitch is created as part of the automated installation. As shown in the below figure, it is configured to use a teamed interface named âteam-vm-network-dataâ with âvm-network-aâ and âvm-network-bâ as member adapters, without jumbo frames. The teaming and load balancing mode are configured for âSwitch Independentâ and âHyper-V Portâ respectively with both adapters in active mode. The VLANs are not Native VLANs as assigned to the vNIC templates, and therefore they are defined in Hyper-V virtual switch manager.
Â·         vswitch-hx-livemigration: This vSwitch is created as part of the automated installation. As shown in the below figure, it is configured to use a teamed interface named âteam-hx-livemigrationâ with âhv-livemigrate-aâ and âhv-livemigrate-bâ as member adapters, with jumbo frames highly recommended. The teaming and load balancing mode are configured for âSwitch Independentâ and âHyper-V Portâ respectively with âhv-livemigrate-bâ adapter in Standby mode. The VLANs are not Native VLANs as assigned to the vNIC templates, and therefore they are defined in Hyper-V virtual switch manager. The IP addresses to this interface are assigned post installation.
Table 26  and Figure 42 provide more details into the Hyper-V virtual networking design as built by the HyperFlex installer by default for a converged node.

Figure 42     Hyper-V Network Design
Figure 43 illustrates the Hyper-V virtual networking design as built by the HyperFlex installer by default for compute nodes. There is no storage controller virtual machine running on a compute node where the IOvisor is redirected and compute is assigned to a controller virtual machine running on a converged node.
Figure 43     Hyper-V Virtual Networking Design
Discrete Device Assignment (I/O Passthrough)
Discrete Device Assignment (DDA) is a feature introduced in Windows Server 2016 Hyper-V allowing access to an entire PCIe device into a virtual machine as though they were physical devices belonging to the virtual machine itself. With the appropriate driver for the hardware device, the guest virtual machine sends all I/O requests directly to the physical device, bypassing the hypervisor. In the Cisco HyperFlex system, the Storage Platform Controller virtual machines use this feature to gain full control of the Cisco 12Gbps SAS HBA cards in the Cisco HX-series rack-mount servers. This gives the controller virtual machines direct hardware level access to the physical disks installed in the servers, which they consume to construct the Cisco HX Distributed Filesystem. Only the disks connected directly to the Cisco SAS HBA are controlled by the controller virtual machines. Other disks, connected to different controllers, such as the M.2 drives, remain under the control of the Hyper-V hypervisor.
          Configuring the DDA feature is done by the Cisco HyperFlex installer and requires no manual steps.
Storage Platform Controller Virtual Machines
A key component of the Cisco HyperFlex system is the Storage Platform Controller Virtual Machine running on each of the nodes in the HyperFlex cluster. The controller virtual machines cooperate to form and coordinate the Cisco HX Distributed Filesystem, and service all the guest virtual machine IO requests. The controller virtual machines deployed on the Hyper-V host are tied to a specific host, they start and stop along with the Hyper-V hypervisor, and the system is not considered to be online and ready until both the hypervisor and the Controller virtual machines have started.
          Each Hyper-V host has a single Controller virtual machine deployed, and it cannot be moved or migrated to another host, nor should its settings be manually modified in any way.
The storage controller virtual machine runs custom software and services that manage and maintain the Cisco HX Distributed Filesystem. The services and processes that run within the controller virtual machines are not exposed, therefore the Hyper-V hosts have any direct knowledge of the storage services provided by the controller virtual machines. Management and visibility into the function of the controller virtual machines, and the Cisco HX Distributed Filesystem is done via the HyperFlex Connect HTML management webpage.
          Deploying the controller virtual machines is done by the Cisco HyperFlex installer and requires no manual steps.
Controller Virtual Machine Locations
The physical storage location of the controller virtual machines across all the Cisco HX-Series M5 generation rack servers (HX220c M5, HXAF220c M5, HX240c M5 and HXAF240c M5) is same due to the physical disk location and connections on those server models. The storage controller virtual machine is operationally no different from any other typical virtual machines in a Hyper-V environment. The virtual machine must have a virtual disk with the bootable root filesystem available in a location separate from the SAS HBA that the virtual machine is controlling via DDA feature of Windows Server 2016/2019 Hyper-V.
Â·         The server boots the Windows Server 2016/2019 Hyper-V from the internal M.2 form factor SSD.
Â·         The Windows installer creates three partitions on the M.2 SSD - 500 MB for recovery partition, 90 GB for Windows OS boot partition and 30 GB partition where controller virtual machineâs root filesystem is stored on a 2.5 GB virtual disk, /dev/sda. Both 90 GB and 30 GB partitions are formatted using NTFS file system. The controller virtual machine has full control of all the front and rear facing hot-swappable disks via DDA control of the SAS HBA. The controller virtual machine operating system sees the 240 GB SSD, also commonly called the âhousekeepingâ disk as /dev/sdb, and places HyperFlex binaries and logs on this disk. The remaining disks seen by the controller virtual machine OS are used by the HX Distributed filesystem for caching and capacity layers.
The following figures detail the Storage Platform Controller virtual machine placement on the Hyper-V hosts for Cisco HX M5 generation servers.
Figure 44      HX220c M5 Controller Virtual Machine Placement
Figure 45      HX240c M5 Controller Virtual Machine Placement
HyperFlex Datastores
A new HyperFlex cluster has no default datastores configured for virtual machine storage, therefore the datastores must be created using the vCenter Web Client plugin or the HyperFlex Connect GUI. It is important to recognize that all HyperFlex datastores are thinly provisioned, meaning that their configured size can far exceed the actual space available in the HyperFlex cluster. Alerts will be raised by the HyperFlex system in HyperFlex Connect when actual space consumption results in low amounts of free space, and alerts will be sent via auto support email alerts. Overall space consumption in the HyperFlex clustered filesystem is optimized by the default deduplication and compression features.
Figure 46     Datastore Example
CPU Resource Control
Since the storage controller virtual machines provide critical functionality of the Cisco HX Distributed Data Platform, the HyperFlex installer will configure CPU resource control for the controller virtual machines. This resource control guarantees that the controller virtual machines will have CPU resources at a minimum level, in situations where the physical CPU resources of the Hyper-V hypervisor host are being heavily consumed by the guest virtual machines. Table 27  details the CPU resource control settings of the storage controller virtual machines.

Memory Resource Reservations
Since the storage controller virtual machines provide critical functionality of the Cisco HX Distributed Data Platform, the HyperFlex installer will configure by allocating static amount of memory for the controller virtual machines. This guarantees that the controller virtual machines will have access to all the memory resources allocated to it at power on. Table 28   details the memory resource reservation of the storage controller virtual machines.

Installation
Installing the Cisco HyperFlex system on Hyper-V is primarily done via a deployable HyperFlex installer virtual machine available for download at cisco.com as a vhdx file. The installer virtual machine performs the Cisco UCS configuration work, the configuration of Hyper-V on the HyperFlex hosts, the installation of the HyperFlex HX Data Platform software and creation of the HyperFlex cluster. Because this simplified installation method has been developed by Cisco, this CVD will not give detailed manual steps for the configuration of all the elements that are handled by the installer. The following sections will guide you through the prerequisites and manual steps needed prior to using the HyperFlex installer, how to utilize the HyperFlex Installer, and finally how to perform the remaining post-installation tasks.
Prerequisites
Prior to beginning the installation activities, it is important to gather the following information:
IP Addressing
To install the HX Data Platform, an OVF installer appliance must be deployed on a separate virtualization host, which is not a member of the HyperFlex cluster. The HyperFlex installer requires one IP address on the management network and the HX installer appliance IP address must be able to communicate with Cisco UCS Manager, Hyper-V management IP addresses on the HX hosts, Windows Active Directory and DNS server and any management server IP addresses from where the Windows failover cluster will be managed.
Additional IP addresses for the Cisco HyperFlex system need to be allocated from the appropriate subnets and VLANs to be used. IP addresses that are used by the system fall into the following groups:
Â·         Cisco UCS Manager: These addresses are used and assigned by Cisco UCS Manager. Three IP addresses are used by Cisco UCS Manager; one address is assigned to each Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect, and the third IP address is a roaming address for management of the Cisco UCS cluster. In addition, at least one IP address per Cisco UCS blade or HX-series rack-mount server is required for the hx-ext-mgmt IP address pool, which are assigned to the CIMC interface of the physical servers. Since these management addresses are assigned from a pool, they need to be provided in a contiguous block of addresses. These addresses must all be in the same subnet.
Â·         HyperFlex and Hyper-V Management: These addresses are used to manage the Hyper-V hypervisor hosts, and the HyperFlex Storage Platform Controller virtual machines. Two IP addresses per node in the HyperFlex cluster are required from the same subnet, an additional IP address is required for roaming HyperFlex cluster management interface and another additional IP address is required for the Windows failover cluster. These addresses can be assigned from the same subnet at the Cisco UCS Manager addresses, or they may be separate.
Â·         HyperFlex Storage: These addresses are used by the HyperFlex Storage Platform Controller virtual machines, and also the Hyper-V hypervisor hosts, for sending and receiving data to/from the HX Distributed Data Platform Filesystem. Two IP addresses per node in the HyperFlex cluster are required from the same subnet, and a single additional IP address is needed as the roaming HyperFlex cluster storage interface. It is recommended to provision a subnet that is not used in the network for other purposes, and it is also possible to use non-routable IP address ranges for these interfaces. Finally, if the Cisco UCS domain is going to contain multiple HyperFlex clusters, it is recommended to use a different subnet and VLAN ID for the HyperFlex storage traffic for each cluster. This is a safer method, guaranteeing that storage traffic from multiple clusters cannot intermix.
Â·         Live Migration: These IP addresses are used by the Hyper-V hypervisor hosts on interfaces to enable live migration capabilities. One or more IP addresses per node in the HyperFlex cluster are required from the same subnet.
The following tables provide space to input the required IP addresses for the installation of an 8-node standard HyperFlex cluster by listing the addresses required, plus an example IP configuration.
          Table cells shaded in black do not require an IP address.

          IP addresses for Cisco UCS Management, plus HyperFlex and Hyper-V Management can come from the same subnet, or can be separate subnets, as long as the HyperFlex installer can reach them both.
DHCP versus Static IP
By default, the HX installation will assign a static IP address to the management interface of the Hyper-V servers. Using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) for automatic IP address assignment in not recommended.  
Configure the Active Directory for Constrained Delegation
A Windows 2008 R2 and above forest/domain level Active Directory (AD) is required for the successful installation and operation of Cisco HyperFlex system with Hyper-V.
The steps in this topic must be completed to enable constrained delegation. Constrained delegation is used to join computers to the Active Directory. You provide constrained delegation information through the HX Data Platform Installer. Constrained delegation uses a service account, which is created manually. This service account is used to then log in to Active Directory, join the computers, and perform the authentications from the HyperFlex Storage Controller virtual machine.
The Active Directory computer accounts applied to every node in the HyperFlex cluster include:
Â·         Hyper-V host
Â·         HyperFlex Storage Controller virtual machine
Â·         Hyper-V host Cluster namespace
Â·         Server Message Block (SMB) Share namespace for the HyperFlex cluster
To configure constrained delegation, follow these steps:
3.    Create an hxadmin domain user account as HX service account.
4.    Create an Organization Unit (OU) in Active Directory (AD), for example, HyperFlex:
a.     Use the Active Directory Users and Computers management tool to create the OU. Select View > Advanced Features to enable advance features. Select the OU that you created. For example, HyperFlex > Properties > Attribute Editor.
b.     Find the distinguished name attribute in the OU and record the information as this will be required in the Constrained Delegation wizard of the HX Data Platform Installer wizard. The values will look like this: OU=HyperFlex,DC=contoso,DC=com.
c.     Use the Get-ADOrganizationalUnit cmdlet to get an organizational unit (OU) object or to perform a search to get multiple OUs.
Get-ADOrganizationalUnit -Filter 'Name -like "Hyp*"' | Format-Table Name, DistinguishedName
Figure 47      PowerShell Get-ADOrganizationalUnit
5.    Use Active Directory Users and Computers management tool to grant full permissions for the hxadmin user for the newly created OU. Make sure that Advanced features are enabled. If not, go back to Step 2.
a.     Select the OU that you created. For example, HyperFlex > Properties > Security > Advance.
d.     Click Change Owner and choose your hxadmin user.
e.     Click Add in the Advanced view.
f.      Select the principal and choose the hxadmin user. Choose Full Control and click OK.
Figure 48      Change Ownership of the AD OU
            To configure the HX service account with the least privileges, refer Appendix section âDâ - Delegating HX service account with least privileges for administrative tasks. With this configuration, one-time domain admin credentials are required during the deployment of HyperFlex clusters
Prepopulate AD DNS with Records
The AD integrated DNS server is also required to resolve Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN).
To create DNS records, follow these steps:
1.    Create a record and reverse the PTR records for the listed devices to avoid installation failures:
-         For each Hyper-V hostsâ management and storage interfaces
-         For each Storage Controller Nodesâ management and storage interfaces
-         HX Cluster CIP
-         Windows Failover Cluster IP
          Do not put in any DNS entry for SMB namespace. SMB namespace resolves differently on each host.
          Standalone and non-Windows DNS servers are not supported.
The following tables provide a place to input the required DNS information for the installation and also lists the information required and provides an example configuration.

NTP
Consistent time clock synchronization is required across the components of the HyperFlex system, provided by reliable NTP servers, accessible for querying in the Cisco UCS Management network group, and the HyperFlex and Hyper-V Management group. NTP is used by Cisco UCS Manager, the Hyper-V hypervisor hosts, and the HyperFlex Storage Platform Controller virtual machines. For HyperFlex System with Hyper-V, AD Domain Controller IP or domain name is required to be used as reliable NTP source for consistent time clock synchronization.
In an Active Directory domain, it is very important for all clocks to be within 5 minutes of each other (by default) due to the implementation of the Kerberos protocol for authentication. Also, Active Directory uses multi-master replication model between Domain Controllers.
  Network Time Protocol (NTP) is the default time synchronization protocol used by the Windows Time Service (W32Time) in Windows servers and workstations. NTP uses UDP port 123 for all time synchronization communication and hence should be unblocked by the firewalls, in both directions.
In Active Directory deployment, the only computer configured with a time server explicitly should be computer holding the PDC Emulator FSMO role in the forest root domain. This is because the Forest root domain PDC emulator is the one and only one-time source for all the Domain Controllers, member servers and windows-based workstations for the entire forest.
All domain controllers in the forest root domain synchronize time with the PDC Emulator FSMO role-holder.
All Domain Controllers in child Domains synchronize time with any Domain Controller with Parent Domain or with PDC Emulator of its own Domain.
All PDC Emulator FSMO role-holders in child domains synchronize their time with domain controllers in their parent domain (including, potentially, the PDC Emulator FSMO role-holder in the forest root domain).
All domain member computers (Servers / Workstations/ any other devices) synchronize time with domain controller computers in their respective domains.
Additionally, virtual machines should not sync time with their host.
Figure 50 shows default time synchronization hierarchy in Active Directory Domain Services.
Figure 50     Time Synchronization in an AD DS Hierarchy
In a Windows domain, the time skew is set in Group Policy under Computer Configuration â Windows Settings â Account Policies â Kerberos Policy â Maximum tolerance for computer clock synchronization, and it is five minutes by default.

VLANs
Prior to the installation, the required VLAN IDs need to be documented, and created in the upstream network if necessary. At a minimum, there are 4 VLANs that need to be trunked to the Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects that comprise the HyperFlex system; a VLAN for the HyperFlex and Hyper-V Management group, a VLAN for the HyperFlex Storage group, a VLAN for the Live Migration group, and at least one VLAN for the guest virtual machine traffic. The VLAN IDs must be supplied during the HyperFlex Cisco UCS configuration step, and the VLAN names can optionally be customized.
The following tables provide a place to input the required VLAN information and also provide an example configuration.

Network Uplinks
The Cisco UCS uplink connectivity design needs to be finalized prior to beginning the installation. One of the early manual tasks to be completed is to configure the Cisco UCS network uplinks and verify their operation, prior to beginning the HyperFlex installation steps. Refer to the network uplink design possibilities in the Network Design section.
The following tables provide a place to input the required network uplink information for the installation and provide an example configuration:

  The following figures show a sample of direct connect mode physical connectivity for Cisco UCS C-Series Rack-Mount Server with Cisco UCS VIC 1457/1455.
Figure 51      Direct Connect Cabling Configuration with Cisco VIC 1400 Series (4-Port Linking)
Figure 52       Direct Connect Cabling Configuration with Cisco VIC 1400 Series (2-Port Linking)
          The following restrictions apply: Ports 1 and 2 must connect to same Fabric Interconnect, for example Fabric-A. Ports 3 and 4 must connect to same Fabric Interconnect, for example Fabric-B. This is due to the internal port-channeling architecture inside the card. Ports 1 and 3 are used because the connections between ports 1 and 2 (also 3 and 4) form an internal port-channel
.
          Do not connect port 1 to Fabric Interconnect A, and port 2 to Fabric Interconnect B. Use ports 1 and 3 only. Using ports 1 and 2 results in discovery and configuration failures.
Cisco UCS Installation
This section explains the steps to initialize and configure the Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects and how to prepare them for the HyperFlex installation.
Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect A
To configure Fabric Interconnect A, follow these steps:
1.    Make sure the Fabric Interconnect cabling is properly connected, including the L1 and L2 cluster links, and power the Fabric Interconnects on by inserting the power cords.
2.    Connect to the console port on the first Fabric Interconnect, which will be designated as the A fabric device. Use the supplied Cisco console cable (CAB-CONSOLE-RJ45=), and connect it to a built-in DB9 serial port, or use a USB to DB9 serial port adapter.
3.    Start your terminal emulator software.

Uplink Ports
The Ethernet ports of a Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect are all capable of performing several functions, such as network uplinks or server ports, and more. By default, all ports are unconfigured, and their function must be defined by the administrator. To define the specified ports to be used as network uplinks to the upstream network, follow these steps:
1.    In Cisco UCS Manager, click Equipment.
2.    Select Fabric Interconnects > Fabric Interconnect A > Fixed Module or Expansion Module as appropriate > Ethernet Ports.
3.    Select the ports that are to be uplink ports, right- click them, and click Configure as Uplink Port.
4.    Click Yes to confirm the configuration and click OK.
5.    Select Fabric Interconnects > Fabric Interconnect B > Fixed Module or Expansion Module as appropriate > Ethernet Ports.
6.    Select the ports that are to be uplink ports, right-click them, and click Configure as Uplink Port.
7.    Click Yes to confirm the configuration and click OK.
8.    Verify all the necessary ports are now configured as uplink ports, where their role is listed as âNetwork.â
Figure 54      Uplinks Ports
Uplink Port Channels
If the Cisco UCS uplinks from one Fabric Interconnect are to be combined into a port channel or vPC, you must separately configure the port channels, which will use the previously configured uplink ports. To configure the necessary port channels in the Cisco UCS environment, follow these steps:
1.    In Cisco UCS Manager, click LAN. 
2.    Under LAN > LAN Cloud, click the carat to expand the Fabric A tree. 
3.    Right-click Port Channels underneath Fabric A, then click Create Port Channel.

5.    Enter the name of the port channel. 
6.    Click Next.
7.    Click each port from Fabric Interconnect A that will participate in the port channel and click the >> button to add them to the port channel.
8.    Click Finish.
9.    Click OK.
10.  Under LAN > LAN Cloud, click the carat to expand the Fabric B tree. 
11.  Right-click Port Channels underneath Fabric B, then click Create Port Channel. 
12.  Enter the port channel ID number as the unique ID of the port channel (this does not have to match the port-channel ID on the upstream switch). 
13.  Enter the name of the port channel. 
14.  Click Next.
15.  Click each port from Fabric Interconnect B that will participate in the port channel and click the >> button to add them to the port channel.
16.  Click Finish.
17.  Click OK.
18.  Verify the necessary port channels have been created. It can take a few minutes for the newly formed port channels to converge and come online.
Figure 55      Uplink Port Channels
Server Ports
The Ethernet ports of a Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect connected to the rack-mount servers must be defined as server ports. When a server port is activated, the connected server or chassis will begin the discovery process shortly afterwards. Rack-mount servers are automatically numbered in Cisco UCS Manager in the order which they are first discovered. For this reason, it is important to configure the server ports sequentially in the order you wish the physical servers and/or chassis to appear within Cisco UCS Manager. For example, if you installed your servers in a cabinet or rack with server #1 on the bottom, counting up as you go higher in the cabinet or rack, then you need to enable the server ports to the bottom-most server first, and enable them one-by-one as you move upward. You must wait until the server appears in the Equipment tab of Cisco UCS Manager before configuring the ports for the next server.
Auto Configuration
A new feature in Cisco UCS Manager 3.1(3a) and later is Server Port Auto-Discovery, which automates the configuration of ports on the Fabric Interconnects as server ports when a Cisco UCS rack-mount server is connected to them. The firmware on the rack-mount servers must already be at version 3.1(3a) or later in order for this feature to function properly. Enabling this policy eliminates the manual steps of configuring each server port, however it does configure the servers in a somewhat random order. For example, the rack-mount server at the bottom of the stack, which you may refer to as server #1, and you may have plugged into port 1 of both Fabric Interconnects, could be discovered as server 2, or server 5, and so on. In order to have fine control of the rack-mount server or chassis numbering and order, the manual configuration steps listed in the next section must be followed.
To configure automatic server port definition and discovery, follow these steps:
1.    In Cisco UCS Manager, click Equipment.
2.    In the navigation tree, under Policies, click Port Auto-Discovery Policy
3.    In the properties pane, set Auto Configure Server Port option to Enabled.
4.    Click Save Changes. 
5.    Click OK.
6.    Wait for a brief period, until the rack-mount servers appear in the Equipment tab underneath Equipment > Rack Mounts > Servers, or the chassis appears underneath Equipment > Chassis.
Figure 56      Port Auto-Discovery Policy
Manual Configuration
To manually define the specified ports to be used as server ports and have control over the numbering of the servers, follow these steps:
1.    In Cisco UCS Manager, click Equipment.
2.    Select Fabric Interconnects > Fabric Interconnect A > Fixed Module or Expansion Module as appropriate > Ethernet Ports.
3.    Select the first port that you want to be a server port, right-click it, and click Configure as Server Port.
4.    Click Yes to confirm the configuration and click OK.
5.    Select Fabric Interconnects > Fabric Interconnect B > Fixed Module or Expansion Module as appropriate > Ethernet Ports.
6.    Select the matching port as chosen for Fabric Interconnect A that that you want to be a server port, right-click it, and click Configure as Server Port.
7.    Click Yes to confirm the configuration and click OK.
8.    Wait for a brief period, until the rack-mount server appears in the Equipment tab underneath Equipment > Rack Mounts > Servers, or the chassis appears underneath Equipment > Chassis.
9.    Repeat steps 1-8 for each pair of server ports, until all rack-mount servers and chassis appear in the order desired in the Equipment tab.
Server Discovery
As previously described, when the server ports of the Fabric Interconnects are configured and active, the servers connected to those ports will begin a discovery process. During discovery, the serversâ internal hardware inventories are collected, along with their current firmware revisions. Before continuing with the HyperFlex installation processes, which will create the service profiles and associate them with the servers, wait for all of the servers to finish their discovery process and to show as unassociated servers that are powered off, with no errors.
Deploy HX Data Platform Installer on Hyper-V Infrastructure
To deploy HX Data Platform Installer using Microsoft Hyper-V Manager to create a HX Data Platform Installer virtual machine, follow these steps:
1.    Locate and download the HX Data Platform Installer.vhdx zipped file (for example, Cisco-HX-Data-Platform-Installer-v4.0.1b-33133-hyperv.vhdx.zip) from the Cisco Software Downloads site.
2.    Extract the zipped folder to your local computer and copy the .vhdx file to the Hyper-V host where you want to host the HX Data Platform Installer. For example,

17.  After logging in with default password, you are prompted to change the default password for root.
Figure 64      HXDP Installer
Assign a Static IP Address to the HX Data Platform Installer Virtual Machine
During a default installation of the virtual machine, the HXDP Installer will try and automatically obtain an IP address using DHCP. To ensure that you have the same IP address on every boot, you can assign a static IP address on the virtual machine.
To configure your network interface (/etc/network/interfaces) with a static IP address. Make sure you change the relevant settings to suit your network and follow these steps:
1.    Log into your Installer machine via the Hyper-V Console.
2.    Type âIfdown eth0â to shoutdown the interface.
3.    Edit the â/etc/network/eth0.interfaceâ file and add the following lines to the file:
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
metric 100
address 10.104.252.48
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 10.104.252.1
dns-nameservers 10.104.252.48
dns-search hxhvdom2.local
4.    Press âESCâ to exit the insert mode and type â.wqâ to save and quit the VI.
5.    Type âIfup eth0â to bring up the interface.
6.    Reboot the virtual machine for changes to take effect.
7.    Verify the settings as shown in the following figures.
Figure 65      Show Interfaces
Figure 66      Routing Table
Figure 67      /etc/resolv.conf file for Nameserver and Search Domain
HyperFlex Installer Web Page
The HyperFlex installer is accessed via a webpage using your local computer and a web browser. If the HyperFlex installer was deployed with a static IP address, then the IP address of the website is already known.
If DHCP was used, open the local console of the installer virtual machine. In the console, you will see an interface similar to the example below, showing the IP address that was leased:
Figure 68      HyperFlex Installer Virtual Machine IP Address
To access the HyperFlex installer webpage, follow these steps:
1.    Open a web browser on the local computer and navigate to the IP address of the installer virtual machine. For example, open http://10.104.252.48
2.    Click accept or continue to bypass any SSL certificate errors.
3.    At the login screen, enter the username: root
4.    At the login screen, enter the password.
5.    Verify the version of the installer in the lower right-hand corner of the Welcome page is the correct version.
6.    Check the box for âI accept the terms and conditionsâ and click Login.
Figure 69      HyperFlex Connect
HyperFlex Installation
The HyperFlex installer will guide you through the process of setting up your cluster. The Windows OS is not factory installed and requires the customer to provide media for the installation. It will configure Cisco UCS policies, templates, service profiles, settings and install Windows Server 2016/2019, as well as assigning IP addresses to the HX servers after the OS installation. The installer will deploy the HyperFlex controller virtual machines and software on the nodes, add the nodes to the Windows failover cluster, then finally create the HyperFlex cluster and distributed filesystem. All these processes can be completed through a single workflow from the HyperFlex Installer webpage.
To install and configure a HyperFlex cluster, follow these steps:
1.    On the HyperFlex installer webpage click âCluster Creation with HyperFlex (FI).â
Figure 70      HyperFlex Installer - Workflow
2.    On the Credentials page:
a.     Under the âUCS Manager Credentialsâ, enter the Cisco UCS Manager Host Name or IP Address, UCS Manager User Name and Password.
g.     Under the âDomain Informationâ, enter the AD Domain Name, DNS Server IP Address, HX Service Account user name and password. It is recommended to select âConfigure Constrained Delegation nowâ and select âUse HX Service Accountâ if HX service account is member of AD Domain Admin group, else provide Domain Admin credentials (which is a one-time requirement). To configure Constrained Delegation later, refer the appendix section of this document.
h.     And, under âAdvanced Attributes (optional)â, enter the Domain Controller IP address and the distinguished name of Organization Unit (OU). Providing distinguished name of the OU is required, if you want the Computer objects created to be placed under a specific OU instead of the default built-in âComputersâ OU.
3.    Optionally, you can import a JSON file that has the configuration information, except for the appropriate passwords. 
4.    Click Continue.
5.    In the Server Selection page:
a.     Select the Unassociated HX server models that are to be used in the new HX cluster and click Continue. We have selected three nodes to demonstrate deployment of 3-node hx cluster.
i.      If the Fabric Interconnect server ports were not enabled in the earlier step, you have the option to enable them here to begin the discovery process by clicking the Configure Server Ports link.
          HyperFlex for Hyper-V only supports M5 Servers for converged nodes.
          Using the option to enable the server ports within the HX Installer will not allow you to finely control the server number order, as would be possible when performing this step manually before installing the HyperFlex cluster. To have control of the server number order, perform the steps outlined earlier for manually configuring the server ports. The server discovery can take several minutes to complete, and it will be necessary to periodically click the Refresh button to see the unassociated servers appear once discovery is completed.
6.    On the UCSM Configuration page:
a.     VLAN Configuration â HyperFlex needs to have at least 4 VLANs to function; each VLAN needs to be on different IP subnets and extended from the fabric interconnects to the connecting uplink switches, to make sure that traffic can flow from Primary Fabric Interconnect (Fabric A) to Subordinate Fabric Interconnect (Fabric B).
b.     Enter the VLAN names and VLAN IDs that are to be created in Cisco UCS, multiple comma separated VLAN IDs for different guest virtual machine networks are allowed here.
          Do not use VLAN 1, since it is not a best practice and can cause issues with disjoint layer 2.
            vm-network can have multiple VLAN IDs added as a comma separated list (as shown in the below screenshot).
            Renaming the 4 core networks is not supported.
c.     MAC Pool - Enter the MAC Pool prefix, only enter the 4th byte value, for example: 00:25:B5:0A.
d.     âhxâ IP Pool for Cisco IMC - Enter the IP address range, subnet mask and gateway to be used by the CIMC interfaces of the servers in this HX cluster.
e.     Cisco IMC access Management (Out of band or inband) â Select the recommended âin bandâ option for faster installation of hypervisor OS on all the hx nodes.
f.      The Out-Of-Band network needs to be on the same subnet as the Cisco UCS Manager. You can add multiple blocks of addresses as a comma separated line.
g.     VLAN for Inband Cisco IMC Connectivity â Enter a VLAN name and ID.
h.     Advanced - If multiple firmware packages exist on the Fabric Interconnect, choose the version to be installed on the servers that will comprise this cluster. Note that for HXDP 4.0(1b) release with M5 generation servers running on 2nd Generation IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Scalable Processors, the supported and recommended version of UCS FI firmwareâs is 4.0(4d).
i.      Enter a unique Org name for the HyperFlex Cluster.
          The Cisco UCS B and C packages must exist on the Fabric interconnect otherwise the installation will fail. If the right version is not available in the drop-down list, then upload it to Cisco UCS Manager before continuing.
j.      iSCSI/FC Storage (optional) â iSCSI Storage and FC Storage are used for adding external storage to the HyperFlex cluster. Not defined for this setup.
          Important: When deploying a second or any additional clusters, you must put them into a different sub-org, use a different MAC Pool prefix, a unique pool of IP addresses for the CIMC interfaces, and you should also create new VLAN names for the additional clusters. Even if reusing the same VLAN ID, it is prudent to create a new VLAN name to avoid conflicts. For example, for a second cluster change the VLAN names, use a unique MAC Pool prefix, IP address pool, Cluster Name and Org Name so as to not overwrite the original cluster information.
7.    Click Continue.
8.    On the Hypervisor Configuration page:
a.     Bare Metal Configuration - If Windows Server 2016/2019 is not installed on the nodes, select âInstall Hypervisor (Hyper-V)â, drag or click browse to upload OS media file in the box and select the radio button to choose OS you want to install.
b.     Configure Common Hypervisor Settings - Enter the subnet mask, gateway, DNS Server IP Address.
c.     Hypervisor Settings - Enter IP addresses and hostnames for the Hypervisors that were created in the pre-installation section phase. The IP addresses will be assigned via Serial over Lan (SoL) through Cisco UCS Manager to the Hyper-V host systems as their management IP addresses.
d.     Primary DNS Suffix - Add any additional DNS suffixes.
9.    Click Continue.
10.  On the IP Addresses page:
a.     Assign the hostnames for the Storage Controllers Management that were created in the pre-installation phase.
          If you leave the checkbox, Make IP Addresses and Hostnames Sequential as checked, then the installer will automatically fill the rest of the servers sequentially.
b.     Assign the additional IP addresses for the Management and Data networks as well as the cluster IP addresses, then click Continue.
          A default gateway is not required for the data network, as those interfaces normally will not communicate with any other hosts or networks, and the subnet can be non-routable.
11.  On the Cluster Configuration page:
a.     Cisco HX Cluster - Enter the Cluster Name (SMB Access Point). Select a Replication Factor from the drop-down list and enter a Windows Failover Cluster Name that was created in the pre-installation phase.
b.     Controller virtual machine - Enter the Password that will be assigned to the Controller virtual machines.
c.     System Services - Enter the AD DNS server IP address, and make sure to use the Active Directory domain name for NTP Server for Controller virtual machines to synchronize time with the Active Directory.
d.     Time Zone â Select a time zone from the drop-down list.
e.     Auto Support - Enable Connected Services to enable management via Cisco Intersight and enter the email address to receive service ticket alerts, then scroll down.
f.      Advanced Configuration - Jumbo Frames should be enabled to ensure the best performance, unless the upstream network is not capable of being configured to transmit jumbo frames. It is not necessary to select Clean up disk partitions for a new cluster installation, but an installation using previously used converged nodes should have the option checked.
12.  Click Start.
13.  Validation of the configuration will now start.  If there are warnings, you can review them and click âSkip Validationâ if the warnings are acceptable.  If there are no warnings, the installer will automatically continue on to the configuration process.
          The initial validation will always fail when using new Cisco UCS 6332 or 6332-16UP model Fabric Interconnects. This is due to the fact that changes to the QoS system classes require these models to reboot. If the validation is skipped, the HyperFlex installer will continue the installation and automatically reboot both Fabric Interconnects sequentially. If this is an initial setup of these Fabric Interconnects, and no other systems are running on them yet, then it is safe to proceed. However, if these Fabric Interconnects are already in use for other workloads, then caution must be taken to ensure that the sequential reboots of both Fabric Interconnects will not interrupt those workloads, and that the QoS changes will not cause traffic drops. Contact Cisco TAC for assistance if this situation applies.
14.  After the pre-installation validations, the HX installer will proceed to complete the deployment and perform all the steps listed at the top of the screen along with their status. The process can also be monitored in Cisco UCS Manager while the profiles and cluster are created.
The figure below shows the Cisco UCS Manager service profile association in progress:
The figure below shows the UCSM > Equipment > Inventory > CIMC with two images in mounted state during the Hypervisor configuration stage in HyperFlex Installer.

15.  Review the Summary screen after the installation completes by selecting Summary.
16.  After the install completes, you may export the cluster configuration by clicking on the downward arrow icon in the top right of the screen. Click OK to save the configuration to a JSON file. This file can be imported to save time if you need to rebuild the same cluster in the future and be kept as a record of the configuration options and settings used during the installation.
17.  After the installation completes, you can click Launch HyperFlex Connect to immediately log into the HTML5 management GUI.
You can go to the cluster expansion immediately after this standard cluster deployment:
Post Installation Tasks
Create Datastores
Create a datastore for storing the virtual machines. This task can be completed by using the HyperFlex Connect HTML management webpage. The Datastores created using HX Connect creates a SMB share which the HyperFlex Hyper-V nodes can use it to store virtual machine files. To configure a new datastore through the HyperFlex Connect webpage, follow these steps:
          Cisco recommends an 8K block size for best performance and as few datastores as possible for ease of management.
1.    Use a web browser to open the HX cluster IP management URL.
2.    Enter the credentials.
3.    Click Login.
4.    Click Datastores in the left pane and click Create Datastore.
Figure 71      HX Connect - Datastores
5.    In the popup, enter the Datastore Name and size. For most applications, leave the Block Size at the default of 8K. Only dedicated Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environments should choose the 4K Block Size option.

6.    Click Create Datastore.
Figure 73      HX Connect â Datastore Status
Constrained Delegation (Optional)
Windows provides a safer form of delegation that could be used by services. When it is configured, constrained delegation restricts the services to which the specified server can act on the behalf of a user. In other words. Constrained Delegation gives granular control over impersonation. When the remote management requests are made to the Hyper-V hosts, it needs to make those requests to the storage on behalf of the caller. This is allowed if that host is trusted for delegation for the CIFS service principal of HX Storage.
Constrained Delegation requires that the option for the security setting User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for Administrators in Admin Approval Mode is set to Elevate without Prompting. This will prevent the global AD policy from overriding policy on HX OU.
          This step must be performed only if Constrained Delegation was not configured during initial installation. It is recommended that you perform this procedure using the HX Installer and not as part of post-installation.
To configure constrained delegation using the domain administrator, follow these steps on each Hyper-V host in the HX Cluster and also on management hosts (with RSAT tools from where you want to remotely perform administrator tasks):
1.    Open the Active Directory Users and Computers snap-in. (From Server Manager, select the server if it is not selected, click Tools >> Active Directory Users and Computers).
2.    From the navigation pane in Active Directory Users and Computers, select the domain and double-click the Computers folder.
3.    From the Computers folder, right-click the computer account of the source server and then click Properties.
Figure 74      Active Directory Users and Computers
4.    From the Properties tab, click the Delegation tab.
5.    On the delegation tab, select Trust this computer for delegation to the specified services only and then select Use any authentication protocol.
Figure 75      Active Directory Users and Computers â Server Properties
6.    Click Add.
7.    From Add Services, click Users or Computers.
8.    From Select Users or Computers, type the name of the destination server.
9.    Click Check Names to verify it and then click OK.
10.  From Add Services, in the list of available services, do the following and then click OK:
a.     To move virtual machine storage, select cifs. This is required if you want to move the storage along with the virtual machine, as well as if you want to move only a virtual machine's storage. If the server is configured to use SMB storage for Hyper-V, this should already be selected.
b.     To move virtual machines, select Microsoft Virtual System Migration Service.
Figure 76      Active Directory Users and Computers â Constrained Delegation
11.  On the Delegation tab of the Properties dialog box, verify that the services you selected in the previous step are listed as the services to which the destination computer can present delegated credentials. Click OK.
12.  From the Computers folder, select the computer account of the destination server and repeat the process. In the Select Users or Computers dialog box, be sure to specify the name of the source server.
Assign IP Addresses to Live Migration and Virtual Machine Network Interfaces
To assign a static IP address to Live Migration and Network Interfaces, log into each Hyper-V node and execute the following commands in PowerShell, follow these steps:
1.    Use the following PowerShell command (from a remote management station) to check if there is vSwitch created for Live Migration network on Hyper-V hosts by the HX installer:
Invoke-Command -ComputerName hxhv11,hxhv12,hxhv14 -ScriptBlock {Get-VMSwitch -name * | select PSComputerName,Name} | Format-Table -AutoSize
Figure 77      PowerShell - Get VMSwitch
2.    Optional - remove the vSwitch named âvswitch-hx-livemigrationâ using the following PowerShell command:
Invoke-Command -ComputerName hxhv11,hxhv12,hxhv14 -ScriptBlock {Remove-VMSwitch -Name vswitch-hx-livemigration}
Figure 78      PowerShell - Remove VMSwitch
3.    Assign a static IP address to the teamed interface named âteam-hx-livemigrationâ or âvswitch-hx-livemigrationâ using the following PowerShell command:
Invoke-Command -ComputerName hxhv11 -ScriptBlock {New-NetIPAddress -ifAlias "team-hx-livemigration" -IPAddress 192.168.73.127 -PrefixLength 24}
Figure 79      PowerShell â Assign Static IP
4.    This step is optional. If there is a requirement for the Hyper-V host also to communicate on virtual machine network, then assign a static IP address to âteam-hx-livemigrationâ using the following PowerShell command:
Invoke-Command -ComputerName hxhv11 -ScriptBlock {New-NetIPAddress -ifAlias "vswitch-hx-vm-network" -IPAddress 172.18.1.127 -PrefixLength 16}
5.    Repeat steps 3 and 4 to assign static IP addresses to the live migration and VM networks on all the Hyper-V hosts
6.    Verify the jumbo frame settings on the live migration network adapters using the below command:
Invoke-Command -ComputerName hxhv11,hxhv12,hxhv14 -ScriptBlock {Get-NetAdapterAdvancedProperty -name hv-livemigrate* | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -Match "Jumbo*"}}
Figure 80      PowerShell â Verify jumbo frame settings
7.    Configure the jumbo frame settings on the live migration network adapters using the below command to set the mtu size to 9014 Bytes.
Invoke-Command -ComputerName hxhv11,hxhv12,hxhv14 -ScriptBlock {Set-NetAdapterAdvancedProperty -Name "hv-livemigrate*" -RegistryKeyword "*JumboPacket" -RegistryValue 9014}
Figure 81      PowerShell â Configure jumbo frame settings
8.    Verify and validate the jumbo frame setting using the below ping command:
Rename the Cluster Network in Windows Failover Cluster - Optional
To rename the default cluster network names assigned during cluster creation to more meaningful names, run the following PowerShell commands from any one HyperFlex Hyper-V host:
1.    Run the âGet-ClusterNetworkâ from one of the Hyper-V nodes as shown below to view information about the cluster network.
Figure 82      PowerShell â Get Cluster Network
2.    Run the below PowerShell command to rename the cluster networks:
Get-ClusterNetwork | Where-Object {$_.Address -eq "10.29.149.0"}).Name = "hx-inband-mgmt" 
(Get-ClusterNetwork | Where-Object {$_.Address -eq "192.168.11.0"}).Name = "hx-storage-data"
(Get-ClusterNetwork | Where-Object {$_.Address -eq "192.168.73.0"}).Name = "LiveMigration"
(Get-ClusterNetwork | Where-Object {$_.Address -eq "172.18.0.0"}).Name = "vm-network"
Figure 83      PowerShell â Rename the Cluster Network
3.    Verify now the cluster network using the âGet-ClusterNetworkâ command:
Figure 84      PowerShell â Verify Cluster Network
Configure the Windows Failover Cluster Network Roles
Cluster networks are automatically configured during the cluster creation. To manually configure the cluster network roles based on their type of function, run the following PowerShell commands on any one HyperFlex Hyper-V host:
1.    Execute the following PowerShell commands to configure the cluster networks roles:
(Get-ClusterNetwork -Name "hx-inband-mgmt").Role = 3 
(Get-ClusterNetwork -Name "hx-storage-data").Role = 0 
(Get-ClusterNetwork -Name "LiveMigration").Role = 1 
(Get-ClusterNetwork -Name "vm-network").Role = 0
Figure 85      PowerShell â Configure Cluster Network Roles
Role = 0 to disable cluster communication
Role = 1 to enable only cluster communication
Role = 3 to enable both cluster & client communication
Figure 86      Failover Cluster Manager - Networks
Configure the Windows Failover Cluster Network for Live Migration
To make sure that you are using the appropriate cluster network for Live Migration traffic configure the Live Migration settings by following these steps:
1.    Run the PowerShell command shown below to configure the cluster network for live migration traffic:
Get-ClusterResourceType -Name "Virtual Machine" | Set-ClusterParameter -Name MigrationExcludeNetworks -Value ([String]::Join(";",(Get-ClusterNetwork | Where-Object {$_.Name -ne "LiveMigration"}).ID))
Figure 87      PowerShell â Configure Live Migration Network
Figure 88      Failover Cluster Manager â Live Migration Settings
Create Folders on the HX Datastore
To create folders on the newly created HX Datastore, follow these steps:
1.    To create a folder, log in to a HyperFlex Hyper-V node and run the following command:
mkdir \\hxhv1smb.hxhvdom.local\hxds1\<folder Name>
Figure 89      Create a Folder on SMB Share
2.    Create folders for different purposes and requirements.
Configure the Default Folder to Store Virtual Machine Files on Hyper-V
By default, Hyper-V stores virtual machine files at the following specified locations:
Â·         âC:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Hyper-Vâ for virtual machine configuration files
Â·         âC:\Users\Public\Documents\Hyper-V\Virtual Hard Disksâ for virtual hard drives
To store the virtual machine files on the newly created highly available HX Datastore as the default folder, follow this step on each HyperFlex Hyper-V hosts:
Run the following PowerShell command from a remote management station to set/change the Hyper-V default store location for virtual hard disk and virtual machine configuration files on all the Hyper-V hosts and verify the settings as shown below:
$hosts = "hxhv11","hxhv12","hxhv13"
Invoke-Command -ComputerName $hosts -ScriptBlock {SET-VMHOST -virtualharddiskpath "\\hxhv1smb.hxhvdom2.local\hxds1\Hyper-V\VHDs" -virtualmachinepath "\\hxhv2smb.hxhvdom2.local\HXDS1\Hyper-V\"}

Figure 91      PowerShell â Configure Virtual Machine Files Store Location
Figure 92      Hyper-V Settings â VHD Store Location
Validate the Windows Failover Cluster Configuration
It is a good practice to validate the Windows failover cluster by running the Validate a Configuration Wizard from the Failover Cluster Manager, or the Test-Cluster Windows PowerShell cmdlet and fix any errors or warnings reported in the results page. Figure 93 shows the command to run the cluster validation.
Figure 93     Failover Cluster - Validate
Configure Quorum in Windows Server Failover Cluster
The quorum is automatically configured during the creation of a new cluster based on the number of nodes and the availability of shared storage. However, as a best practice, run the cluster validation tool as shown in the above section and review the quorum configuration and fix any warnings related to quorum configuration.
Review the information about quorum resources using the âGet-ClusterQuorumâ PowerShell cmdlet or from the Summary page of failover cluster manager as shown below:
Figure 94      PowerShell â Get Cluster Quorum
Figure 95      Failover Cluster Manager
Run the following PowerShell command to configure the cluster quorum by placing the witness on a file share:
Set-ClusterQuorum -NodeAndFileShareMajority "\\fileserver\fsw"
Figure 96      PowerShell â Configure Cluster Quorum
Figure 97      Failover Cluster Manager â Quorum Configuration
          It is recommended to place the file share witness on a server outside of the cluster. Windows Server 2019 supports using a USB drive connected to a network (router) device as a file share witness for failover clustering.
Initial Tasks and Testing
In order to perform initial testing and learn about the features in the HyperFlex cluster, create a test virtual machine stored on your new HX datastore in order to take a snapshot and perform a cloning operation.
Ready Clones
HXDP ReadyClones in a Hyper-V environment are created using a PowerShell Script that is available for download from Cisco CCO web site. Basically, two or three steps take place in the background when ReadyClone VMs are created. In the first step, the original VM is exported to a temporary folder and in the second step the saved VM is imported to a new location and registered. Later the VM is added to the cluster if that option is chosen. After the successful creation ReadyClone VMs, the exported temp folder will be deleted automatically
To create ReadyClones from a running VM, follow these steps:
1.    Download the Cisco HyperFlex Data Platform Hyper-V ReadyClone PowerShell Script from the below location:
https://software.cisco.com/download/home/286305544/type/286305994/release/4.0(1b)
2.    Log into a HX Hyper-V node or a remote management station with RSAT tools.
3.    Open PowerShell and run the downloaded script as shown below:
HxClone-HyperV-v4.0.1b-33133.ps1 -VmName <VM Name> -ClonePrefix <Prefix> -CloneCount <number> -AddToCluster <$false/$true>
Figure 98      PowerShell â Create Ready Clones
4.    From the Failover Cluster manager or Hyper-V manager, select the ReadyClone VM and turn ON as it will be in the saved state.

$true â creates a highly available clustered ReadyClone VMs (visible in Failover Cluster Manager and Hyper-V Manager as well)
Auto-Support and Notifications
Auto-Support should be enabled for all clusters during the initial HyperFlex installation. Auto-Support enables Call Home to automatically send support information to Cisco TAC, and notifications of tickets to the email address specified. If the settings need to be modified, they can be changed in the HyperFlex Connect HTML management webpage.
A list of events that automatically open a support ticket with Cisco TAC are as follows:
Â·         Cluster Capacity Changed
Â·         Cluster Unhealthy
Â·         Cluster Health Critical
Â·         Cluster Read Only
Â·         Cluster Shutdown
Â·         Space Warning
Â·         Space Alert
Â·         Space Critical
Â·         Disk Blacklisted
Â·         Infrastructure Component Critical
Â·         Storage Timeout
To change Auto-Support settings, follow these steps:
1.    From the HyperFlex Connect webpage, click the gear shaped icon in the upper right-hand corner, and click Auto-Support Settings.
2.    Enable or disable Auto-Support as needed.
3.    Enter the email address to receive alerts when Auto-Support events are generated.
4.    Enable or disable Remote Support as needed. Remote support allows Cisco TAC to connect to the HX cluster and accelerate troubleshooting efforts.
5.    Enter in the information for a web proxy, if needed.
6.    Click OK.

Smart Licensing
HyperFlex 2.5 and later utilizes Cisco Smart Licensing, which communicates with a Cisco Smart Account to validate and check out HyperFlex licenses to the nodes, from the pool of available licenses in the account. At the beginning, Smart Licensing is enabled but the HX storage cluster is unregistered and in a 90-day evaluation period or EVAL MODE. For the HX storage cluster to start reporting license consumption, it must be registered with the Cisco Smart Software Manager (SSM) through a valid Cisco Smart Account. Before beginning, verify that you have a Cisco Smart account, and valid HyperFlex licenses are available to be checked out by your HX cluster.
To create a Smart Account, go to Create Smart Accounts. 
To activate and configure smart licensing, follow these steps:
1.    Log into a controller virtual machine. Confirm that your HX storage cluster is in Smart Licensing mode by entering the following:
stcli license show status
Figure 102   Storage Controller Virtual Machine â View License
          Feedback will show Smart Licensing is ENABLED, Status: UNREGISTERED, and the amount of time left during the 90-day evaluation period (in days, hours, minutes, and seconds).
2.    Navigate to Cisco Software Central (https://software.cisco.com/) and log in to your Smart Account.
3.    From Cisco Smart Software Manager, generate a registration token. 
4.    In the License pane, click Smart Software Licensing to open Cisco Smart Software Manager.
5.    Click Inventory.
6.    From the virtual account where you want to register your HX storage cluster, click General, and then click New Token.
7.    In the Create Registration Token dialog box, add a short Description for the token, enter the number of days you want the token to be active and available to use on other products, and check Allow export-controlled functionality on the products registered with this token.
8.    Click Create Token.
9.    From the New ID Token row, click the Actions drop-down list, and click Copy.
10.  Log into a controller virtual machine.
11.  Register your HX storage cluster, where idtoken-string is the New ID Token from Cisco Smart Software Manager.
# stcli license register --idtoken idtoken-string
12.  Confirm that your HX storage cluster is registered.
# stcli license show summary
HyperFlex Cluster Expansion
The process to expand a HyperFlex cluster can be used to grow an existing HyperFlex cluster with additional converged storage nodes, or to expand an existing cluster with additional compute-only nodes to create an extended cluster.
Expansion with Converged Nodes
The HX installer has a wizard for Cluster Expansion with Converged Nodes. This procedure is very similar to the initial HyperFlex cluster setup. The following process assumes a new Cisco HX node has been ordered, therefore it is pre-configured from the factory with the proper hardware and firmware installed.
Prerequisites
Refer to IP Addressing, Prepopulate AD DNS with Records, and Cabling in the âInstallationâ section before continuing with the following steps.
To add converged storage nodes to an existing HyperFlex cluster, follow these steps:
1.    On the HyperFlex installer webpage click the drop-down list for Expand Cluster, then click Converged Node.
2.    On the Cluster Page:
a.     Enter the HX Cluster Management IP address, Cluster Admin User name and password. You can select the option to see the passwords in clear text.
b.     Optionally, you can import a JSON file that has the configuration information, except for the appropriate passwords. 
3.    Click Continue.
4.    On the Credentials Page:
a.     Cisco UCS Manager Credentials â Enter the Cisco UCS Manager DNS hostname or IP address, the admin usernames, and the passwords.
b.     Domain Information - Enter the HX Service Account user name and password. It is recommended to select âConstrained Delegationâ here to avoid configuring it manually after the installation completion. Then select âUse HX Service Accountâ, if HX service account is member of AD Domain Admin group, else provide Domain Admin credentials (which is a one-time requirement).
5.    On the Node Selection page:
a.     Select the Unassociated HX servers you want to add to the existing HX cluster.
6.    Click Continue.
7.    On the Cisco UCS Manager Configuration page:
a.     VLAN Configuration - Enter the VLAN names and VLAN IDs that are to be created in Cisco UCS, multiple comma-separated VLAN IDs for different guest virtual machine networks are allowed here.
c.     MAC Pool - Enter the MAC Pool prefix, only enter the 4th byte value, for example: 00:25:B5:0A.
d.     âhxâ IP Pool for Cisco IMC - Enter the IP address range, subnet mask and gateway to be used by the CIMC interfaces of the servers in this HX cluster.
e.     Cisco IMC access Management (Out-of-band or inband) â Select the recommended âin bandâ option for faster installation of hypervisor OS on all the hx nodes.
f.      The Out-Of-Band network needs to be on the same subnet as the Cisco UCS Manager. You can add multiple blocks of addresses as a comma separated line.
g.     VLAN for Inband Cisco IMC Connectivity â Enter a VLAN name and ID.
h.     iSCSI/FC Storage (optional) â iSCSI Storage and FC Storage are used for adding external storage to the HyperFlex cluster. Not defined for this setup.
i.      Advanced - If multiple firmware packages exist on the Fabric Interconnect, choose the version to be installed on the servers that will comprise this cluster. Enter a unique Org name for the HyperFlex Cluster.
8.    Click Continue.
9.    On the Hypervisor Configuration page:
a.     Bare Metal Configuration - If Windows Server 2016 is not installed on the nodes, select âInstall Hypervisor (Hyper-V)â, drag or click Browse to upload OS media file in the box and select the radio button to choose OS you want to install.
b.     Hypervisor Settings - Enter IP addresses and hostnames for the Hypervisors that were created in the pre-installation section phase. The IP addresses will be assigned through Serial over Lan (SoL) through Cisco UCS Manager to the Hyper-V host systems as their management IP addresses.
c.     Hypervisor Credentials â this field is pre-populated and canât be edited.
10.  Click Continue.
11.  On the Node Configuration Page:
a.     Hypervisor Settings â Here enter the Subnet Mask, Gateway, and DNS Server IP addresses.
b.     Failover Cluster Name â Enter the Windows failover cluster name.
c.     IP Addresses - If you leave the checkbox, Make IP Addresses and Hostnames Sequential as checked, then the installer will automatically fill the rest of the servers sequentially.
d.     Assign the additional IP addresses for the Management and Data networks as well as the cluster IP addresses.
e.     (Optional) At this step you can manually add more servers for expansion if these servers already have service profiles associated and the hypervisor is ready, by clicking on Add Converged Server and then entering the IP addresses for the storage controller management and data networks.
f.      Advanced Configuration â Select Clean up disk partitions in case if the server has been used previously.
12.  Click Start.
13.  Validation of the configuration will now start.  If there are warnings, you can review and click âSkip Validationâ if the warnings are acceptable (e.g. you might get the warning from Cisco UCS Manager validation that the guest VLAN is already assigned).  If there are no warnings, the validation will automatically continue on to the configuration process. 
The HX installer will now proceed to complete the deployment and perform all the and list their status. 
14.  You can review the summary screen after the installation completes by selecting Summary.
15.  After the installation has completed, the new converged node is added to the cluster, and its storage, CPU, and RAM resources are immediately available. Launch HyperFlex Connect to verify the expansion of the cluster using converged node in the Dashboard, Activity and System Information sections.
16.  Launch Failover Cluster Manager to verify the expansion of the Windows cluster also.
17.  For more information, refer to section Assign IP Addresses to Live Migration and Virtual Machine Network Interfaces.
Expansion with Compute-Only Nodes
The following technical guidelines must be followed when adding compute-only nodes to a Cisco HyperFlex cluster:
Â·         The number of compute-only nodes cannot exceed the number of HyperFlex converged nodes within a single HyperFlex cluster.
Â·         The Cisco UCS infrastructure firmware revision, which provides the firmware for Cisco UCS Manager and the Fabric Interconnects, must be maintained at the minimum version required for the HyperFlex converged nodes, or higher, at all times.
Â·         The version of Microsoft Hyper-V installed on the compute-only nodes must be compatible with the Cisco HyperFlex version in use, and it must match the version installed on the HyperFlex converged nodes.
Â·         While the CPU models and memory capacities between the compute-only nodes and the HyperFlex converged nodes do not have to match, configuring the nodes to have similar capacities is recommended.
Â·         Care must be taken that the addition of the compute-only nodes will not significantly impact the HyperFlex cluster by creating additional load, or by consuming too much space. Pay close attention to the space consumption and performance requirements of any net-new virtual machines that will run on the additional compute-only nodes and note the current cluster performance and space utilization. If no new virtual machines will be created, then the current cluster performance will not be impacted.
Â·         Mixing different models of compute-only nodes is allowed within the same cluster. Example: using Cisco UCS B220 M4, B200 M5 and C220 M5 servers as compute-only nodes is allowed.
Â·         Connectivity between compute-only nodes and the HyperFlex cluster must be within the same Cisco UCS domain and must be 10 GbE or 40 GbE. Connecting compute-only nodes from a different Cisco UCS domain is not allowed and connecting standalone rack-mount servers from outside of the Cisco UCS domain is not allowed.
Â·         Blade servers installed in the Cisco UCS 5108 Blade Chassis can connect through 10 GbE or 40 GbE chassis links, using the Cisco UCS 2204XP, 2208XP, or 2304 model Fabric Extenders. The Fabric Extenders, also called I/O Modules (IOMs), are typically installed in pairs, and connect the 5108 chassis to the Fabric Interconnects, which provide all the networking and management for the blades. Care must be taken not to oversubscribe and saturate the chassis links.
Â·         Mixing CPU generations will require configuring Processor Compatibility in order to allow Live Migration to work between the compute-only nodes and the converged nodes. Enabling Processor Compatibility typically requires all virtual machines to be powered off. If it is known ahead of time that Processor Compatibility will be needed, then it is easier to enable it on the Hyper-V Manager prior to installing HyperFlex as shown below:
Â·         Compute-only nodes can be configured to boot from SAN or local disks. No other internal storage should be present in a compute-only node. Manual configuration of the boot policy will be necessary if booting from any device other than M.2 drive.
Prerequisites
Refer to IP Addressing, Prepopulate AD DNS with Records, and Cabling in the âInstallationâ section before continuing with the following steps. The HX installer has a wizard for Cluster Expansion with converged nodes and compute-only nodes, however the compute-only node process requires some additional manual steps to install the Windows Server 2016 on the nodes. To expand an existing HyperFlex cluster with compute-only nodes, follow these steps:
1.    On the HyperFlex installer webpage click the drop-down list for Expand Cluster, then click Compute Node.
2.    Select âRun UCS Manager Configurationâ as shown below:
3.    Click Continue and click Confirm and Proceed on the warning pop-up message.
4.    On the Credentials Page:
-         Cisco UCS Manager Credentials â Enter the Cisco UCS Manager DNS hostname or IP address, the admin usernames, and the passwords.
5.    On the Server Selection page:
-         Select the unassociated server/s you want to add to the existing HX cluster. In this case UCSC-C220-M5SX is selected.
6.    Click Continue.
7.    On the Cisco UCSM Configuration page:
a.     VLAN Configuration - Enter the VLAN names and VLAN IDs that are to be created in Cisco UCS, multiple comma-separated VLAN IDs for different guest virtual machine networks are allowed.
b.     MAC Pool - Enter the MAC Pool prefix, only enter the 4th byte value, for example: 00:25:B5:0A.
c.     âhxâ IP Pool for Cisco IMC - Enter the IP address range, subnet mask and gateway to be used by the CIMC interfaces of the servers in this HX cluster.
d.     Cisco IMC access Management (Out of band or inband) â Select the recommended âin bandâ option for faster installation of hypervisor OS on all the hx nodes.
e.     The Out-Of-Band network needs to be on the same subnet as the Cisco UCS Manager. You can add multiple blocks of addresses as a comma separated line.
f.      VLAN for Inband Cisco IMC Connectivity â Enter a VLAN name and ID.
g.     iSCSI/FC Storage (optional) â iSCSI Storage and FC Storage are used for adding external storage to the HyperFlex cluster. Not defined for this setup.
h.     Advanced - If multiple firmware packages exist on the Fabric Interconnect, choose the version to be installed on the servers that will comprise this cluster. Enter a unique Org name for the HyperFlex Cluster.
8.    Click Start.

Configure Remote Management Stations for Managing VMs in HX Cluster
By default, only the Hyper-V nodes in the HX Cluster have access to the SMB share exposed by the HX datastore. Hence, these nodes require no additional configuration for deploying and managing virtual machines in HX cluster.
For deploying and managing virtual machines in HX cluster from a remote management station (running Windows Remote Server Administration Tools - RSAT, System Center VMM, and so on) requires opening of port 445 to provide access to the SMB share exposed by HX Datastore.
To allow access to SMB share on remote management stations, follow these steps:
1.    SSH into one of the HX Storage Controller VMs and find out the ensemble members in the cluster by executing the below command:
cat /etc/springpath/storfs.cfg | grep crmZKEnsemble
2.    To allow access to the SMB share on remote management station, execute the following command without any parameters as shown below:
python /opt/springpath/storfs-hyperv/FixScvmmAccess.py
3.    From the remote management station execute the below PowerShell script to verify access to the SMB share: 
Test-Path \\FQDN HX SMB Access Point>
4.    If the output of the above command is âfalseâ, edit/modify the hosts file on the remote management station by adding an entry to map the FQDN of HX SMB Access point with its IP address for name resolution as shown below:
5.    Verify the above configuration using the âtest-pathâ PowerShell command and/or by accessing the SMB share using file explorer as shown in the following screenshots:
Microsoft Hyper-V Manager
Hyper-V Manager is a free GUI-based administration tool for managing Hyper-V hosts and virtual machines, both locally and remotely. By default, the management tool is installed locally on Windows Servers where the Hyper-V role is enabled. To manage Hyper-V hosts from remote Windows client/server, Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) feature needs to be installed.
To manage Hyper-V hosts from a remote management station, follow these steps:
1.    Install the RSAT tools for Hyper-V using the following PowerShell command:
Install-WindowsFeature rsat-hyper-v-tools
2.    Complete the steps described in the above section "Configuring Remote Management Stations for Managing VMs in HX Cluster."
Basic management functions like changing the default store location for virtual machine files and creating virtual machines are described in the following sections. For more information about managing Hyper-V using Hyper-V manager refer to the Microsoft website.

11.  In Hyper-V Manager, right-click the virtual machine to perform various operations like Connect, Edit Settings, Start/Stop, and so on.
          By default, virtual machines created using Hyper-V Manager are not highly available and they become unavailable if the host server goes down for some reason. However, you can convert these standalone (non-highly available) virtual machines into clustered virtual machine roles using failover cluster manager for high availability.
Windows Failover Cluster Manager
Cisco HyperFlex DataPlatform installer creates the Hyper-V Failover Cluster during the deployment of HX Cluster, and this can be managed both remotely and locally using the Failover Cluster Manager. It is installed when you install the Failover Clustering Tools, which you can do either through a full Failover Cluster installation or a tools-only installation on a remote Windows 10 or 2016 Server.
          By default, virtual machines created using Failover Cluster Manager are highly available and are treated as clustered virtual machine roles. You can also convert a standalone virtual machine into a clustered role using failover cluster manager. By creating clustered virtual machines, you can consolidate multiple servers on one physical server without causing that server to become a single point of failure. Instead, if that server, or cluster node, fails or requires scheduled maintenance, then another node begins to run the virtual machines instead through a process known as failover.
To manage the Hyper-V Failover Cluster in HyperFlex System from a remote management host, follow these steps:
1.    Install the RSAT tools for Failover Cluster using the below PowerShell command:
Install-WindowsFeature RSAT-Clustering-MGMT
2.    Complete the steps described in the above section "Configuring Remote Management Stations for Managing VMs in HX Cluster"
To create the clustered virtual machine role using the Failover Cluster Manager, follow these steps:
          For more information about managing Hyper-V Cluster using Failover Cluster Manager refer to the Microsoft website.

Appendix
A: Cluster Capacity Calculations
HyperFlex HX Data Platform cluster capacity is calculated as follows:
(((<capacity disk size in GB> X 10^9) / 1024^3) X <number of capacity disks per node> X <number of HyperFlex nodes> X 0.92) / replication factor
Divide the result by 1024 to get a value in TiB
The replication factor value is 3 if the HX cluster is set to RF=3, and the value is 2 if the HX cluster is set to RF=2.
The 0.92 multiplier accounts for an 8% reservation set aside on each disk by the HX Data Platform software for various internal filesystem functions.
Calculation example:
<capacity disk size in GB> = 960
<number of capacity disks per node> = 8 for an HXAF220c-M5SX model server
<number of HyperFlex nodes> = 8
replication factor = 3
Result: (((960*10^9)/1024^3)*8*8*0.92)/3 = 17547.6074
17547.6074/ 1024 = 17.14 TiB
B: Install Microsoft Windows Server 2016/2019
The Windows ISO and HyperFlex Driver image files must be placed on a shared location (such as HX Installer) that is reachable from Cisco UCS Manager and the Out-of-band subnet. Use the following steps to download and host the HyperFlex Driver Image and Windows ISO in a shared location within the installer VM.
To install Windows Server 2016/2019 and apply Cisco HyperFlex driver image on all HX nodes, follow these high-level steps.
Â·         Configure Cisco UCS Manager using HX Installer
Â·         Configure Cisco UCS vMedia and Boot Policies
Â·         Install Microsoft Windows Server 2019 OS
Â·         Undo vMedia and Boot Policy Changes
Configure Cisco UCS Manager using HX Installer
To complete this step, refer to section HyperFlex Installation.
Configure Cisco UCS vMedia and Boot Policies
By using a Cisco UCS vMedia policy, the Windows Server 2016 media ISO file and Cisco HyperFlex Driver image can be mounted to all of the HX servers automatically. The existing vMedia policy, named âHyperFlexâ must be modified to mount this file, and the boot policy must be modified temporarily to boot from the remotely mounted vMedia file. Once these two tasks are completed, the servers can be rebooted, and they will automatically boot from the When mounted vMedia file, installing and configuring Windows Server 2016 on the HX nodes.
          WARNING!  While vMedia policies are very efficient for installing multiple servers, using vMedia policies as described could lead to an accidental reinstall of Windows on any existing server that is rebooted with this policy. Please be certain that the servers being rebooted while the policy is in effect are the servers you wish to reinstall. Even though the custom ISO will not continue without a secondary confirmation, extreme caution is recommended. This procedure needs to be carefully monitored and the boot policy should be changed back to original settings immediately after the intended servers are rebooted, and the Windows installation begins. Using this policy is only recommended for new installs or rebuilds. Alternatively, you can manually select the boot device using the KVM console during boot, and pressing F6, instead of making the vMedia device the default boot selection. 
To configure the Cisco UCS vMedia and Boot Policies, follow these steps:
1.    Connect to your HX Installer VM and browse to the folder that contains the /var/www/localhost/images/.
2.    Copy the HyperFlex Driver Image âlatest.imgâ (/opt/springpath/packages/latest.img) to the images folder ( /var/www/localhost/images/).
3.    Copy Windows Server 2016 iso image to the HXDP installerâs images folder (/var/www/localhost/images/ )
Figure 153   Upload Windows ISO and Cisco Driver and System Preparation Script
For Windows Server 2019, follow these additional steps to prepare a suitable Driver image for automated OS install.
1.    Copy the HyperFlex Driver Image. For example, run the following command:
rsync -avzP /opt/springpath/packages/latest.img /var/www/localhost/images/install.img
2.    Mount the HyperFlex Driver Image. For example, run the following command:
mkdir -p /mnt/install-img && mount -o loop,rw /var/www/localhost/images/install.img /mnt/install-img
3.    Copy the answer file specific to Windows Server 2019. For example, run the following command:
cp /opt/springpath/packages/FactoryUnattendXML/WindowsServer2019/Autounattend.xml.ro /mnt/install-img/Autounattend.xml
4.    Unmount the HyperFlex Driver Image. For example, run the following command:
umount /mnt/install-img
          Make sure network connectivity exists between the file share and all server management IPs.
5.    Configure the vMedia and Boot policies using Cisco UCS Manager to mount the above images.
6.    Launch Cisco UCS Manager by accessing the Cisco UCS Manager IP address in a browser of your choice.
7.    Click Launch UCS Manager and log in with administrator username and the password you used at the beginning of the installation.
8.    In the left navigation pane, click Servers.

C: Live Migration of Virtual Machines Between a Standalone Hyper-V Host and HyperFlex Hyper-V Host
This section covers the steps to configure and perform live migration of virtual machines between two non-clustered Hyper-V hosts. This is sometimes called as âshared-nothingâ live migration. Basically, this Hyper-V feature allows migration of workloads running on existing standalone Hyper-V hosts or Hyper-V cluster to the newly deployed HyperFlex Cluster
Prerequisites
Before you perform the steps in this document, make sure that your environment meets the following prerequisites:
Â·         The source and destination computers either belong to the same Active Directory domain or belong to domains that trust each other.
Â·         The user account has the appropriate permission to perform the various steps:
-         Configure HX storage access to the standalone Hyper-V host
-         To configure and perform the live migrations, the account must be a member of the local Hyper-V Administrators group or the Administrators group on both the source and destination computers.
Â·         A computer running Windows with the Hyper-V management tools installed. For instructions, see http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh857623.aspx
To manage the live migration tasks with remote management tools, configure constrained delegation and select Kerberos as the authentication protocol. Otherwise, you must sign on to the source computer to perform a live migration, and CredSSP is used to authenticate the live migration. 
Â·         hxhvinfra2. hxhvdom2.local â is a standalone hyper-v host in AD domain âhxhvdom2.localâ
Â·         hxhv11. hxhvdom2.local â is a Hyper-V host in a HyperFlex cluster belonging to the same above AD domain âhxhvdom2.localâ
Configure HX Storage Access to the Standalone Hyper-V Host
To configure HX storage access to the standalone Hyper-V host, follow these steps:
1.    Note down the IP address of the standalone Hyper-V host
2.    Log into one of the StCtlVM using SSH and execute the below command to open the port.
python /opt/springpath/storfs-hyperv/FixScvmmAccess.py
3.    Enter the IP address of the standalone Hyper-V host at the âEnter Ip address of SCVMMâ prompt as shown below. (This step is to allow access to the SMB share on HX Datastore)
Figure 169   Storage Access script to open port
4.    On the standalone Hyper-V host, edit the host file and add an entry with IP address of HX SMB Access Point mapping to its FQDN. The following PowerShell command will add the above entry to the host file:
Add-Content -Path C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts -Value "`r`n10.104.252.135`thxhv1smb.hxhvdom2.local" -Force
Figure 170   Edit Hosts file to add an entry
          `r and `n used after the value parameter are PowerShell notation of carriage return and new line and the IP address and hostname are separated by `t which is the PowerShell notation for a tab character.
Figure 171   Source computer â Hosts file entry Mapping
5.    Verify now if the HX Cluster SMB share is accessible now using the below PowerShell command or browse the SMB Share
test-path \\hxhv1smb.hxhvdom2.local\hxds1

Figure 173   Command to Verify Access to SMB Share
Configure the Source and Destination Computers for Live Migration
This section covers the steps to enable live migrations and configure the source and destination servers to send and receive live migrations.  As a security best practice, it is recommended that you select specific networks to use for live migration traffic.
To configure the source computer (standalone Hyper-V hosts) for live migration, follow these steps:
1.    Open Hyper-V Manager
2.    In the navigation pane, select the source servers in navigation pane
3.    In the Action pane, click Hyper-V Settings.
4.    In Hyper-V Settings dialog box, click Live Migrations.
5.    In the Live Migrations pane, check Enable incoming and outgoing live migrations.
6.    Under Simultaneous live migrations, specify a different number if you donât want to use the default of 2.
7.    Under Incoming live migrations, if you want to use specific network connections to accept live migration traffic, click Add to type the IP address information. Otherwise, click Use any available network for live migration. Click OK.
Figure 174   Source computer Hyper-V Settings for Live Migration
8.    If you have configured constrained delegation in the earlier section, expand Live Migrations and then select Advanced Features.
9.    In the Advanced Features pane, under Authentication protocol, select CredSSP.
10.  Click OK.
Figure 175   Source computer Hyper-V Settings for Live Migration Advanced Features
          CredSSP authentication protocol requires user must logon to the server to perform a live migration. Kerberos requires constrained delegation for live migration.
Configure Performance Options for Live Migration - Optional
This section covers the steps to configure the live migration performance options. The default performance options can reduce overhead on the network and CPU usage in addition to the reducing the amount of time for a live migration. To configure the appropriate live migration performance options based on your environment and requirements, follow these steps:
1.    From Hyper-V Manager, select one of the servers you want to configure for live migrations.
2.    In the Action pane, click Hyper-V Settings.
3.    In the Hyper-V Settings dialog box, expand Live Migrations and then select Advanced Features.
4.    In the Advanced Features pane, under Performance options, select the appropriate option for your environment, and then click OK.
Move a Running Virtual Machine
To move a running virtual machine, follow the below steps:
1.    From the remote host with RSAT tools installed, open Hyper-V Manager.
2.    From Hyper-V Manager, click the name of the source server.
3.    From the Virtual Machines section of Hyper-V Manager, right-click the virtual machine and then click Move.
4.    On the Choose Move Type page of the Move Wizard, choose Move the virtual machine.
5.    On the Specify Destination page, type the name or browse to the destination computer.

D: Delegate HX Service Account with Least Privileges for Administrative Tasks
A service account in the AD domain with appropriate privileges is required to deploy and manage HyperFlex clusters successfully. You can either grant full domain admin privileges or grant absolute minimum permissions necessary to the service account for deploying and managing HyperFlex Hyper-V clusters. From a security perspective, it is highly recommended to grant service accounts with least privileges security for any administrative tasks.
In the HyperFlex Installation section, the service account was granted with full domain admin privileges for HyperFlex deployment. This section explains the steps to delegate the service account for HyperFlex with least security privileges necessary for administrative tasks.
To delegate HX Service Account with least privileges for administrative tasks, follow these steps:
1.    Log into the Active Directory server as a domain administrator.
2.    Open Active Directory Users & Computers and navigate to the Organizational Unit (OU) created in the above steps.
3.    Right-click the OU and click Delegate Control.
Figure 182   AD Users and Computers â Delegate Control to OU
4.    Click Next on the Delegation of Control Wizard
5.    In Users or Groups window of Delegation of Control Wizard, click Add.
6.    In Select Users, Computers, or Groups window, enter the HX service account (hxadmin) and click Next.
Figure 183   AD Users and Computers â Select Users, Computers, or Groups
7.    In Tasks to Delegate, select Create a custom task to delegate. Click Next.
Figure 184   Delegation of Control Wizard
8.    In Active Directory Object Type, complete the following and then click Next:
a.     Select Only the following objects in the folder and check Computer Objects.
b.     Check the boxes:
Create selected objects in the folder.
Delete selected objects in this folder.
Figure 185   Delegation of Control Wizard â Active Directory Object Type
9.    In Permissions, check the following and then click Next:
a.     In Show these permissions, select General and Property-specific.
b.     In Permissions, select the following permissions to ensure AD includes the appropriate permissions.
Read servicePrincipalName.
Write servicePrincipalName.
Figure 186   Delegation of Control Wizard â Permissions
Click Finish.
AD replication might take a few minutes to complete user delegation on all domain controllers.
E: Common Resiliency and High Availability Scenario for HX Hyper-V
1.    If a Node Failure or OS/Windows Crash - VMs are failed over to the surviving node.
2.    If a Drive Failure occurs - This is invisible to the OS for HX Disks as the HX File system will auto repair degraded data.
3.    If the OS boot disk fails - VMs are failed over to the surviving node.
4.    If the Controller VM or Controller VMâs disk fails - SMB traffic redirection through DFS and SMB client.
5.    If there is a Network Failure - VMs will be isolated for up to 4 minutes on isolated node. After that VMs will be failed over and node quarantined.
Hyper-V Failover Clustering Resiliency
1.    Virtual Machine Load Balancing (move VMs on memory pressure and cpu utilization).
2.    High Availability increased with Transient Error reactions.
3.    Set a Resiliency level and period.
4.    Isolated node(s) donât immediately failover VMs (transient network error).
5.    Unhealthy nodes quarantined (VMs failed over.
6.    Host Resource Protection (throttle noisy neighbor VMs).
