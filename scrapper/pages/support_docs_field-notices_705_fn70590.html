Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCvk10081 ISE uses TLS 1.0 when proxy configured and TLS 1.2 if no proxy configured
Problem Description
For the affected Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) versions, the Cisco feed service for posture updates and client provisioning via Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0 is no longer considered secure and has been discontinued.
Background
When proxy connections are configured, ISE connections to external sites for posture updates and client provisioning that use TLS 1.0 are no longer considered secure. The Cisco feed service headend currently operates with TLS 1.2 for improved security.
Problem Symptom
For the affected ISE versions, proxy connections to external sites for posture updates and client provisioning will fail with an error when TLS 1.0 is used.
The posture updates error displayed on the ISE console is shown in this image.
The client provisioning error displayed on the ISE console is shown in this image.
Workaround/Solution
In order to utilize TLS 1.2 for proxy connections, upgrade the ISE system software to one of these versions:
ISE 2.2 Patch 12 or later
ISE 2.3 Patch 6 or later
ISE 2.4 or later
If an upgrade to the ISE system software is not immediately possible, perform the Cisco ISE Offline Updates process. To do so, see the respective Cisco Identity Services Engine Release Notes document for the ISE version used.
