Introduction
Cisco Fabric Manager is the management tool for storage networking across all Cisco SAN and unified fabrics.
Cisco Fabric Manager provides comprehensive visibility for improved management and control of Cisco storage networks (2-, 4-, and 8-Gbps Fibre Channel and Fibre Channel over Ethernet [FCoE]), and it helps reduce overall total cost of ownership (TCO) and complexity through unified discovery of all Cisco Data Center 3.0 devices and through task automation and detailed reporting.
Cisco Fabric Manager provides centralized storage network management services, performance monitoring, federated reporting, troubleshooting tools, discovery, and configuration automation for the data center.
Cisco Fabric Manager includes these management applications:
•Fabric Manager (client and server)
•Fabric Manager standalone (FMSA)
•Device Manager
•Performance Manager
•Fabric Manager Web Services
For detailed information on using Cisco Fabric Manager to configure a Cisco MDS 9000 Family switch or a Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch, refer to the feature-specific Cisco Fabric Manager Configuration Guides available at the following website:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps10495/tsd_products_support_series_home.html
Version Compatibility
As the features and capabilities of Cisco Fabric Manager continue to evolve, it is important to be aware of the software version compatibility information described in the following sections.
Compatibility with Cisco MDS 9000 Family Switches
•Cisco Family Fabric Manager Release 4.2(1) can manage MDS 9000 switches that are running any NX-OS 4.x release or any SAN-OS 3.x release.
•Any Fabric Manager 3.x release cannot fully manage switches that are running any MDS 9000 NX-OS 4.x release because Fabric Manager Release 3.x cannot manage features that are specific to the MDS 9000 NX-OS 4.x release series. Fabric Manager Release 3.3(x) can manage all legacy features in any SAN-OS 3.x, 2.x, and 1.x release.
•In terms of testing and support, future releases of Cisco Fabric Manager 4.x will be backwards compatible with the two previous releases of MDS NX-OS 4.x and with the two highest releases in the SAN-OS 3.x release series.
Compatibility with Cisco Nexus 5000 Series Switches
Cisco Family Fabric Manager Release 4.2(1) has limited support for Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches running versions earlier than Release 4.0(1a)N1, because it does not support FCoE features on Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches running versions earlier than Release 4.0(1a)N1.

Installation Changes for Cisco Fabric Manager in This Release
If you plan to make use of the new Fabric Manager Server federation feature, which is described in the "Fabric Manager Server Federation" section, then you need to follow a slightly different installation procedure for Cisco Fabric Manager. See the "Installation of Cisco MDS NX-OS and Fabric Manager" section in the Cisco Fabric Manager Fundamentals Configuration Guide for details.
If you do not plan to install a federation of servers, then the installation procedure is unchanged from Cisco Fabric Manager Release 4.13(b).
Upgrading Your Version of Cisco Fabric Manager
Cisco Fabric Manager is included on the CD-ROM that ships with the switch. You can install Fabric Manager from the CD-ROM or from files that you download.
Installing Cisco Fabric Manager is a multistep process that involves installing a database, as well as Fabric Manager. The complete installation instructions are provided in the "Installation of Cisco MDS NX-OS and Fabric Manager" section in the Cisco Fabric Manager Fundamentals Configuration Guide, and are available on-screen once you launch the Fabric Manager installer from the CD-ROM.
Note When upgrading Fabric Manager, refer to the supported upgrade path shown in Table 3. For example, when upgrading from SAN-OS Release 3.1(x) to NX-OS Release 4.2(x), you will need to upgrade from Release 3.1(x) to Release 3.2(x) to Release 3.3(x) and then upgrade to NX-OS Release 4.2(x).

Fabric Manager Installation Process Overview
The following section presents the flow of the installation process at a high level. Review these steps before you begin the installation process:
1. Verify supported software. Cisco Fabric Manager and Device Manager have been tested with the software listed in Table 4.
2. Ensure data migration when upgrading Cisco Fabric Manager from Cisco SAN-OS Releases 3.1(2b) and later.
If you are upgrading Cisco Fabric Manager in Cisco SAN-OS Releases 3.1(2b) and later, be aware that data is migrated from the Hypersonic HSQL database to either the PostgreSQL database or Oracle Database 10g Express during the installation. Data is also migrated from Oracle Database 10g Express to Oracle Database 10g Express. If you migrate the database from Oracle to Oracle, the schema is updated. Refer to Table 3 for information on the supported upgrade path.
3. Ensure data migration when upgrading Cisco Fabric Manager from releases prior to Cisco NX-OS Releases 3.1(2).
If you are upgrading Fabric Manager in a Cisco SAN-OS Release prior to 3.1(2b), be aware that data is migrated from the Hypersonic HSQL database to either the PostgreSQL database or the Oracle Database 10g Express during the installation. The Fabric Manager Installer installs the PostgreSQL database on Windows. If you want to install the PostgreSQL database on Solaris or Linux, or if you want to install the Oracle Database 10g Express database, follow the instructions in the "Installing Fabric Manager" section in the Cisco Fabric Manager Fundamentals Configuration Guide.
4. If you are upgrading a previous installation of Fabric Manager, make sure the previous installation is installed and running. Do not uninstall the previous version. If the previous version is uninstalled, the database will not be migrated and your server settings will not be preserved.
5. Select the database.
If you want to use the Oracle Database 10g Express, you must install the database and create a user name and password before continuing with the Fabric Manager installation. We recommend the Oracle Database 10g Express option for all users who are running Performance Manager on large fabrics (1000 or more end devices).
If you want to install the PostgreSQL database, you must disable any security software you are running as PostgreSQL may not install certain folders or users. You must also log in as a Superuser before you start the installation.
6. Install Fabric Manager from the CD-ROM or from files that you download from cisco.com at the following website: http://cisco.com/cgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/mds-fm.
Installing Fabric Manager on Solaris
This section describes how to install Fabric Manager on Solaris.
To install Fabric Manager on Solaris, follow these steps:
Step 1 Set Java 1.5 or 1.6 to the path that is to be used for installing Fabric Manager.
Step 2 Install the database that is to be used with Fabric Manager.
Step 3 Copy the Fabric Manager jar file m9000-fm-4.2.1.jar from the CD-ROM to a folder on the Solaris workstation.
Step 4 Launch the installer using the following command:
java -Xms512m -Xmx512m -jar m9000-fm-4.2.1.jar
Step 5 Follow the onscreen instructions provided in the Fabric Manager management software setup wizard.
Installing Fabric Manager on Windows
This section describes how to install Fabric Manager on Windows.
Note Fabric Manager Server cannot be installed on an Active Directory Server when using PostgreSQL. Fabric Manager servers are domain controllers and cannot create local PostgreSQL user accounts.
Note If you are running Fabric Manager Server on Windows and using the PostgreSQL database, you should examine your Windows Active Directory environment for organizational units (OUs) and make the change recommended below to ensure that Fabric Manager Server does not periodically stop working.

On a Windows system, the Microsoft Active Directory applies a Group Policy Object (GPO) to the Fabric Manager Server. The GPO does not recognize the local user PostgreSQL because it is not in the GPO allow list. As a result, the GPO removes it, and the PostgreSQL database stops working.

To avoid this situation, you should move the Fabric Manager Server to its own OU and apply the same feature settings as the original OU, but remove the local user account to log in as a service.
If your server is running Terminal Services in Application mode, or if you are running Citrix Metaframe or any other variation, you need to enter the following command at the DOS prompt before installing Fabric Manager Server:
Step 1 Open a command-line prompt by selecting Start > Run, and then type cmd and press Return.
Step 2 At the command prompt, type user /install.
Note Do not close the command line window. This must remain open for the entire duration of the install.
The following is an example of the output of this command:
C:\Documents and Settings\user.domain>USER /INSTALL
User session is ready to install applications.

Step 3 Follow all steps needed to install Fabric Manager, Fabric Manager Server, and Device Manager. See the instructions later in this section.
Step 4 When the installation is complete, at the command prompt, type user /execute and press Return. Then type exit and press Return.
The following is an example of the output of this command:
C:\Documents and Settings\user.domain>USER /execute
User session is ready to execute applications.
To install Fabric Manager on Windows, follow these steps:
Step 1 Click the Install Management Software link.
Step 2 Choose Management Software > Cisco Fabric Manager.
Step 3 Click the Installing Fabric Manager link.
Step 4 Select the drive for your CD-ROM.
Step 5 Click the FM Installer link.
Step 6 Follow the onscreen instructions provided in the Fabric Manager Installer 4.2(1).
Note If you have any folders open or Windows Explorer task windows open during the installation, you might see the following error message:

C:\Program Files\Cisco Systems\dcm\fm\help\shared\images\Thumbs.db (Access is denied)

To resolve this issue, close all open folders and open Windows Explorer task windows and restart the FM Installer.
Caution Windows 2000 is incompatible with Fabric Manager Release 4.2(1). If you install Fabric Manager in a Windows 2000 environment, you are at risk of having an unstable Fabric Manager. We recommend that you exit the installation and update your environment. See Table 4 for the list of supported software that has been tested with Cisco Fabric Manager. See Table 3 for the supported upgrade paths for Fabric Manager.
To install Device Manager on your workstation, follow these steps:
Step 1 Enter the IP address of the switch in the Address field of your browser.
Step 2 Click the Cisco Device Manager link in the Device Manager installation window.
Step 3 Click Next to begin the installation.
Step 4 Follow the onscreen instructions to complete the installation of Device Manager.
Note If you use a Java JDK instead of a JRE on Solaris, you might encounter a problem trying to install the Device Manager from a web browser. This can happen because the installer heap limit of 256 MB is not sufficient. If you have this problem, save the jnlp link as file, increase the heap limit to 512 MB, and run javaws element-manager.jnlp at the shell prompt.

Cisco Fabric Manager Feature Descriptions
This section includes descriptions of the major new features of MDS Fabric Manager Release 4.2(1) and indicates where the feature is documented.
Fabric Manager Server Federation
The Fabric Manager Server federation feature improves management availability and scalability by load balancing fabric discovery, performance monitoring, and event handling processes. Fabric Manager provides a single management pane to view and manage all fabrics within a single federation. A storage administrator can discover and move fabrics within a federation for the purpose of load balancing, high availability, or disaster recovery. In addition, users can connect to any Fabric Manager Server and view all report, inventory, statistics, or logs from a single web browser.
The Fabric Manager Server federation includes these features:
•All Fabric Manager Server nodes in the federation access a common database.
•Up to ten Fabric Manager Servers can form a federation (or cluster) that can manage over 100,000 end devices
•Fabric Manager Clients can access any server transparently
The Fabric Manager Server federation feature requires the Fabric Manager Server License.
Where Documented
For information about the Fabric Manager Server federation feature, see the Cisco Fabric Manager Fundamentals Configuration Guide.
Data Center Switch Discovery Through CDP
Cisco Fabric Manager now supports discovery of all Cisco Nexus family switches, Catalyst 4500 Series switches, and Catalyst 6500 Series switches through the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP). CDP is a device discovery protocol that runs on all Cisco manufactured equipment, including MDS 9000 Family switches, Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches, Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switches, and Catalyst switches. This feature can provide increased control and visibility of all data center devices by making it easier to plan, configure, and manage unified fabric deployments.
Switch discovery through CDP has the following attributes:
•All MDS 9000 Family switches, Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches, Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switches, Catalyst 4500 Series switches, and Catalyst 6500 Series switches can be discovered.
•Fabric Manager displays all switches and their ISLs in topology view map.
•It supports IPv4 and provides detailed physical attributes for MDS 9000 Family switches and Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches.
Where Documented
For information about the switch discovery through CDP feature, see the Cisco Fabric Manager Fundamentals Configuration Guide.
Fabric Manager Host Provisioning Wizard
The Cisco Fabric Manager Host Provisioning Wizard provides the ability to set up communication between the existing host and storage devices by using a single management tool. The wizard is designed to provide the requisite utilities to perform seamless migrations.
The wizard allows the administrator to quickly commission and decommission hosts and do the following activities:
•Create a device alias for the host
•Create a DPVM entry for the host
•Add a host and storage device to a zone and activate the zone
•Create a flow between a host and storage device for performance monitoring
Where Documented
For information about the Fabric Manager Host Provisioning Wizard, see the Cisco Fabric Manager Fabric Configuration Guide.
Fabric Manager Client Launch Pad
Fabric Manager provides an ability to view the network data and topology through its client application. To load the client, users can log into the server's web interface and start the client from a hyperlink. In an environment where there are multiple Fabric Managers of nonidentical versions managing different parts of the network, users would have to go through the web interfaces of these servers independently to get to their corresponding client because Fabric Manager clients of a particular release may not necessarily be compatible with servers of another release.
The Fabric Manager launch pad, which is new in Fabric Manager Release 4.2(1), introduces a way to circumvent compatibility matching of Fabric Manager Client and Server releases. The process is simplified by taking the server's web URL and starting the client directly through the Java Webstart process. Users no longer need to go through the web interface to load the client. Users will also no longer encounter interoperability issues running multiple versions of Fabric Manager in their network. The launch pad can connect to any Fabric Manager server that is running Fabric Manager Release 3.3(x) or later, through the HTTP protocol and can directly start the server's corresponding client. The launch pad helps users avoid the server's web interface and the client/server interoperability issue.
To load the launch pad, users need to log into the Fabric Manager Web Server to retrieve the launch pad. Once retrieved, subsequent retrieval of the launch pad is unnecessary because a shortcut of the launch pad will be placed on the user's desktop.
The launch pad does not archive Fabric Manager code; it simply facilitates the load of Fabric Manager with the JVM. The launch pad is not aware of the host machine's disk space or memory requirements to launch Fabric Manager. Users should understand that loading the client consumes disk space and increases the memory requirement footprint. The Fabric Manager launch pad can load Fabric Manager clients of version 3.3(x) or later releases.
Where Documented
For information about the Fabric Manager launch pad, see the Cisco Fabric Manager Fundamentals Configuration Guide.
Performance Statistics in the Fabric Manager Web Client
In Fabric Manager Release 4.2(1), you can access performance charts for a topology map or a selected table. You can switch to and from a real-time view of performance statistics.
Where Documented
For information about performance statistics in Fabric Manager, see the Cisco Fabric Manager Fundamentals Configuration Guide.
Fabric Manager Software Install Wizard
The Fabric Manager software install wizard that is available in Fabric Manager Release 4.2(1), provides data caching for repeated use. The wizard can cache the common information input by a particular user, including server location, file transfer protocol, username, and switch image information.
This feature also includes a management domain-based switch list. Rather than listing all the switches in a fabric, this feature enforces domain filtering by listing only those switches contained in a selected management domain. This feature automates the software upgrade process for those switches, and allows a user to save the input data and reuse it for the next software upgrade.
In addition, a new Parallel Version Check/Install checkbox has been added to provide a mechanism for a parallel version check, with or without software installation for all selected switches.
Where Documented
For information about the Fabric Manager software install wizard, see the Cisco Fabric Manager Fundamentals Configuration Guide.
Fabric Manager Platform Changes
The following changes have been made to the platforms that Cisco Fabric Manager supports in Fabric Manager Release 4.2(1):
•Support has been discontinued for the following platforms:
–Solaris 8
–Red Hat Linux Release 4
–Firefox prior to Release 3.0

Caution You must upgrade to Fabric Manager Release 3.1(x) and then upgrade to a later release of Fabric Manager to avoid losing Performance Manager data. If data has been lost, follow the steps below to recover the data.
To recover lost data, follow these steps:
Step 1 Disable Performance Manager interpolation using Fabric Manager Web Client. Uncheck Interpolate missing statistics, then click Apply.
Step 2 Stop the Fabric Manager Server.
Step 3 Save the data file in the $INSTALL_DIR directory.
Step 4 Move the old RRD file into the $INSTALL_DIR/pm/db directory.
Step 5 Run $INSTALL_DIR/bin/pm.bat s.
Step 6 Restart Fabric Manager Server.
Java Web Start
When using Java Web Start, it is recommended that you do not use an HTML cache or proxy server. You can use the Java Web Start Preferences panel to view or edit the proxy configuration. To do this, launch the Application Manager, either by clicking the desktop icon (Microsoft Windows), or type ./javaws in the Java Web Start installation directory (Solaris Operating Environment and Linux), and then select Edit> Preferences.
If you fail to change these settings, you may encounter installation issues regarding a version mismatch. If this occurs, you should clear your Java cache and retry.
Shortcuts Remain on Desktop After Uninstall
If you install Fabric Manager or Device Manager on Windows Vista, you may see the application shortcuts on your desktop, even after you uninstall the application. To remove the shortcuts, refresh the desktop.
Limitations Specific to Cisco MDS 9000 Family Switches

Deleting Cisco SME Interfaces
A Cisco SME interface can be deleted from the cluster only after the interface is administratively shut down and all related tasks associated with the interface shutdown are complete.
Emulex Driver Version
In some instances, the Emulex driver version 8.1.10.9 may set the task attribute to HEAD_OF_QUEUE instead of SIMPLE_QUEUE. Certain tape drives do not accept this attribute and may reject these commands. The Emulex driver version 8.1.10.12 does not have this issue.
Compatibility of Fabric Manager and Data Mobility Manager
Cisco Fabric Manager in any MDS NX-OS 4.x release does not support Data Mobility Manager (DMM) in any SAN-OS 3.3(x) release or in any 3.2(x) release. To use the Cisco Fabric Manager GUI for DMM, both Fabric Manager and DMM must be running NX-OS or SAN-OS software from the same release series.
Using Fabric Manager for an In-Service Software Upgrade (ISSU)
If you are using Fabric Manager to perform an ISSU to NX-OS Release 4.2(1) from any release prior to NX-OS Release 4.1(1a), the upgrade might fail. To work around this issue, perform the upgrade from the command-line interface using the install all command. DDTS CSCta94252, which is a duplicate of CSCsu68898, captures the details of this issue.
ISSU downgrades are not impacted.
Limitations for the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series Switches
This section lists the Cisco Fabric Manager limitations related to managing Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches.
Ethernet Configuration
You cannot configure physical Ethernet interfaces using Fabric Manager or Device Manager. You must configure physical Ethernet interfaces using CLI commands.
SPAN
You cannot use Device Manager to configure Ethernet or virtual Ethernet interfaces as SPAN source ports or to configure Ethernet interfaces as destination ports. The workaround is to configure SPAN using CLI commands.
Zoning
In the Edit Local Full Zone Database tool, virtual Fibre Channel interfaces must be specified using the Switch Port WWN method of adding members to a zone. In the Add Members to Zone dialog box, the Switch & Port method and the Domain & Port method are not supported for virtual Fibre Channel interfaces.
Caveats
This section lists the open and resolved caveats for this release. Use Table 7 to determine the status of a particular caveat. In the table, "O" indicates an open caveat and "R" indicates a resolved caveat.

Resolved Caveats
•CSCsy35135
Symptom: Installing Fabric Manager and then installing Device Manager from Fabric Manager Server causes the Cisco Fabric Manager desktop shortcut and menu item to be changed to the Cisco Device Manager desktop shortcut and Cisco Device Manager menu item.
Workaround: This issue is resolved.
•CSCsz70307
Symptom: While Fabric Manager discovers the fabric, SNMP fails and the switch reloads. The HBAs of the end devices in the fabric have Fabric-Device Management Interface (FDMI) enabled.
Workaround: This issue is resolved.
•CSCsy23429
Symptom: Cross site scripting (XSS) issues exist in Fabric Manager Server when the Microsoft Internet Explorer web browser is used for web client management.
Workaround: This issue is resolved.
Open Caveats
•CSCsk35725
Symptom: Fabric Manager takes 2 to 3 minutes to bring up the DMM job creation wizard in a setup with 25 switches, 400 enclosures, and 2400 entries in the name server.
Workaround: None.
•CSCsu72195
Symptom: When replaying DMM job configurations saved as an ASCII text file (after performing a write erase), the DMM job includes discrepancies. These discrepancies occur due to the interface and zone configurations that are in an area below the DMM job configuration in the ASCII text file. The configurations stored in the ASCII text file are replayed sequentially from top to bottom.
Workaround: None.
