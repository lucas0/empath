    This document describes the features, issues, and deployment guidelines for Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator software.
Cisco Multi-Site is an architecture that allows you to interconnect separate Cisco APIC, Cloud Network Controller (formerly known as Cloud APIC), and NDFC (formerly known as DCNM) domains (fabrics) each representing a different region. This helps ensure multitenant Layer 2 and Layer 3 network connectivity across sites and extends the policy domain end-to-end across the entire system.
Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator is the intersite policy manager. It provides single-pane management that enables you to monitor the health of all the interconnected sites. It also allows you to centrally define the intersite configurations and policies that can then be pushed to the different Cisco APIC, Cloud Network Controller, or DCNM fabrics, which in term deploy them in those fabrics. This provides a high degree of control over when and where to deploy the configurations.

Product Impact
Feature
Description
Ease of Use
Simplified, UI-driven upgrade from any NDO release 3.3(1) or later to this release
You can upgrade to Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator release 4.1(2) using the standard UI-driven upgrade workflow from any 3.3(1) or later release.
For more information, see the “Upgrading Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator” sections of the Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator Deployment Guide.
Base Functionality
Support for importing existing L3Out and route peering configurations
You can now use the new L3Out template type and workflows to import existing IP L3Out and SR-MPLS VRF L3Out configurations from Cisco APIC.
For more information, see the “Configuring External Connectivity” chapter of the Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator Configuration Guide for ACI Fabrics.
Performance and Scalability
Increased Scale for Tenants, VPCs, and Endpoints in Multi-Cloud Deployments
This release provides increased multi-cloud and hybrid cloud scale with Cisco Cloud Network Controller release 26.0(1) as described in the Cloud Network Controller Verified Scalability Guide.
Increased Scale for Preferred Group (PG) EPGs
The scale limit for the number of Preferred Group (PG) EPGs has been increased to 5000 as listed in the Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator Verified Scalability Guide.
    New Hardware Features
There is no new hardware supported in this release.
The complete list of supported hardware is available in the “Deploying Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator” chapter of the Cisco Multi-Site Deployment Guide.
Changes in Behavior
●      For all new deployments, we recommend deploying Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator service in Nexus Dashboard 2.3(2) or later.
●      If you upgrade to this release from a release prior to 4.0(1) and have template versioning enabled (supported since release 3.4(1)), only the latest versions of the templates are preserved during the upgrade.
All other existing versions of templates, including older versions that are tagged Golden, will not be transferred during the upgrade.
●      Downgrading from this release is not supported.
We recommend creating a full backup of the configuration before upgrading to Release 4.1(x), so that if you ever want to downgrade, you can deploy a brand-new cluster using an earlier version and then restore your configuration in it.
●      Beginning with Release 4.0(1), the “Application Profiles per Schema” scale limit has been removed.
For the full list of maximum verified scale limits, see the Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator Verified Scalability Guide.
●      Beginning with Release 4.0(1), if you have route leaking configured for a VRF, you must delete those configurations before you delete the VRF or undeploy the template containing that VRF.
●      Beginning with Release 4.0(1), if you are configuring EPG Preferred Group (PG), you must explicitly enable PG on the VRF.
In prior releases, enabling PG on an EPG automatically enabled the configuration on the associated VRF. For detailed information on configuring PG in Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator, see the “EPG Preferred Group” chapter of the Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator Configuration Guide for ACI Fabrics.
●      When deploying a subset of template policies, such as after a configuration change or update, the deployment time has been significantly improved.

You may notice that shadow VRF2 is missing on site1 and shadow VRF1 is missing on site2
4.1(2e)
CSCwe19071
If the IP address of a site managed by NDO is not reachable when you attempt to deploy or undeploy a Fabric Resources template associated with that site, you may receive the following error:
Failed to connect to APIC. Verify that you are connecting to an APIC. Error message: Post "https://<ip-address>/api/node/mo/uni.json": dial tcp <ip-address>: i/o timeout
When you deploy or undeploy an application template which is associated with the site and stretched to other sites, you may run into an issue that fvRemoteId MOs are not pushed from NDO to the site, which will cause a traffic drop.
4.1(2e)
Known Issues
This section lists known behaviors. Click the Bug ID to access the Bug Search Tool and see additional information about the issue.
Bug ID                    
Description
CSCvv67993
NDO will not update or delete VRF vzAny configuration which was directly created on APIC even though the VRF is managed by NDO.
CSCvo82001
Unable to download Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator report and debug logs when database and server logs are selected
CSCvo32313
Unicast traffic flow between Remote Leaf Site1 and Remote Leaf in Site2 may be enabled by default. This feature is not officially supported in this release.
CSCvn38255
After downgrading from 2.1(1), preferred group traffic continues to work. You must disable the preferred group feature before downgrading to an earlier release.
CSCvn90706
No validation is available for shared services scenarios
CSCvo59133
The upstream server may time out when enabling audit log streaming
CSCvd59276
For Cisco Multi-Site, Fabric IDs Must be the Same for All Sites, or the Querier IP address Must be Higher on One Site.
The Cisco APIC fabric querier functions have a distributed architecture, where each leaf switch acts as a querier, and packets are flooded. A copy is also replicated to the fabric port. There is an Access Control List (ACL) configured on each TOR to drop this query packet coming from the fabric port. If the source MAC address is the fabric MAC address, unique per fabric, then the MAC address is derived from the fabric-id. The fabric ID is configured by users during initial bring up of a pod site.
In the Cisco Multi-Site Stretched BD with Layer 2 Broadcast Extension use case, the query packets from each TOR get to the other sites and should be dropped. If the fabric-id is configured differently on the sites, it is not possible to drop them.
To avoid this, configure the fabric IDs the same on each site, or the querier IP address on one of the sites should be higher than on the other sites.
CSCvd61787
STP and "Flood in Encapsulation" Option are not Supported with Cisco Multi-Site.
In Cisco Multi-Site topologies, regardless of whether EPGs are stretched between sites or localized, STP packets do not reach remote sites. Similarly, the "Flood in Encapsulation" option is not supported across sites. In both cases, packets are encapsulated using an FD VNID (fab-encap) of the access VLAN on the ingress TOR. It is a known issue that there is no capability to translate these IDs on the remote sites.
CSCvi61260
If an infra L3Out that is being managed by Cisco Multi-Site is modified locally in a Cisco APIC, Cisco Multi-Site might delete the objects not managed by Cisco Multi-Site in an L3Out.
CSCvq07769
"Phone Number" field is required in all releases prior to Release 2.2(1). Users with no phone number specified in Release 2.2(1) or later will not be able to log in to the GUI when Orchestrator is downgraded to an earlier release.
CSCvu71584
Routes are not programmed on CSR and the contract config is not pushed to the Cloud site.
CSCvw47022
Shadow of cloud VRF may be unexpectedly created or deleted on the on-premises site.
CSCvt47568
Let's say APIC has EPGs with some contract relationships. If this EPG and the relationships are imported into NDO and then the relationship was removed and deployed to APIC, NDO doesn't delete the contract relationship on the APIC.
CSCwa31774
When creating VRFs in infra tenant on a Google Cloud site, you may see them classified as internal VRF in NDO. If you then import these VRFs in NDO, the allowed routeleak configuration will be determined based on whether the VRF is used for external connectivity (external VRF) or not (internal VRF).
This is because on cAPIC, VRFs in infra tenant can fall into 3 categories: internal, external and un-decided.
NDO treats infra tenant VRFs as 2 categories for simplicity: internal and external.
There is no usecase impacted because of this.
CSCwa47934
Removing site connectivity or changing the protocol is not allowed between two sites.
CSCwa52287
Template goes to approved state when the number of approvals is fewer than the required number of approvers.
CSCvz08520
Missing BD1/VRF1 in site S2 will impact the forwarding from EPG1 in site S1 to EPG1/EPG2 in site S2
CSCvy31532
After a site is re-registered, NDO may have connectivity issues with APIC or CAPIC
CSCwc62636
If cloud sites have EVPN-based connectivity with another cloud or on-premises site, then contract-based routing must be enabled for intersite traffic to work.
CSCwc59208
When APIC-owned L3Outs are deleted manually on APIC by the user, stretched and shadow InstP belonging to the L3Outs get deleted as expected. However, when deploying the template from NDO, only the stretched InstPs detected in config drift will get deployed.
CSCwc52360
When using APIs, template names must not include spaces.
CSCwa87027
After unmanaging an external fabric that contains route-servers, Infra Connectivity page in NDO still shows the route-servers.
Since the route-servers are still maintained, the overlay IFC from the route-servers to any BGW devices in the DCNM are not removed.
