Introduction
This document describes the use of multiple TrustSec matrices and DefCon matrices in Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) 2.2. This is a new TrustSec feature introduced in ISE 2.2 for better granularity in the network.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:

Basic knowledge of Cisco TrustSec (CTS) components
Basic knowledge of CLI configuration of Catalyst switches
Experience with Identity Services Engine (ISE) configuration
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:

Identity Services Engine 2.2
Cisco Catalyst Switch 3850 03.07.03.E
Cisco Catalyst Switch 3750X 15.2(4)E1
Windows 7 machines
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.

Background Information
In ISE 2.0 there is a possibility to use only one production TrustSec matrix for all network devices. ISE 2.1 added feature called staging matrix that can be used for testing and implementation purposes. Policies created in staging matrix are applied only to network devices used for tests. The rest of the devices still use production matrix. Once staging matrix is confirmed to work fine, all other devices can be moved to it and it becomes new production matrix.
ISE 2.2 comes with two new TrustSec features:

Multiple matrices - ability to assign different matrices to network devices
DefCon matrix - this matrix is pushed to all network devices in particular situation, triggered by administrator
It is possible to use either single matrix feature or production and staging matrix feature in ISE 2.2.
Multiple Matrices
In order to use multiple matrices, you have to enable this option under Work Centers > TrustSec > Settings > Work Process Settings, as shown in the image:
Once this is enabled, you can create new matrices and later on assign network devices to the specific matrix.
DefCon Matrices
DefCon matrices are special matrices, ready to be deployed at any time. When deployed, all network devices are automatically assigned to this matrix. ISE still remembers the last production matrix for all network devices, so this change can be reverted back at any point when DefCon is deactivated. You can define up to four different DefCon matrices:
DefCon1 - Critical
DefCon2 - Severe
DefCon3 - Substantial
DefCon4 - Moderate
DefCon matrices can be used in combination with all three work process options:

Network Diagram
Configurations
In order to use multiple matrices, you have to enable it under Work Process Settings. In this example, enable also DefCon matrix.
1. Basic switch configuration for RADIUS/CTS
radius server ISE
 address ipv4 10.48.17.161 auth-port 1812 acct-port 1813
 pac key cisco

aaa group server radius ISE
 server name ISE
 ip radius source-interface FastEthernet0

ip radius source-interface FastEthernet0 

aaa server radius dynamic-author
 client 10.48.17.161 server-key cisco
aaa new-model
aaa authentication dot1x default group ISE
aaa accounting dot1x default start-stop group ISE 
In order to obtain CTS information, you have to create CTS authorization list:
cts authorization list LIST
aaa authorization network LIST group ISE
2. CTS PAC
To receive CTS PAC (Protected Access Credentials) from ISE, you have to configure the same credentials on switch and ISE under Advanced TrustSec configuration for network device:
cts credentials id GALA password cisco 
Once this is configured, a switch is able to download CTS PAC. One part of it (PAC-Opaque) is being sent as AV-pair in every RADIUS request to ISE, so ISE can verify if PAC for this network device is still valid:
GALA#show cts pacs 
  AID: E6796CD7BBF2FA4111AD9FB4FEFB5A50
  PAC-Info:
    PAC-type = Cisco Trustsec
    AID: E6796CD7BBF2FA4111AD9FB4FEFB5A50
    I-ID: GALA
    A-ID-Info: Identity Services Engine
    Credential Lifetime: 17:05:50 CEST Apr 5 2017
  PAC-Opaque: 000200B00003000100040010E6796CD7BBF2FA4111AD9FB4FEFB5A50000600940003010012FABE10F3DCBCB152C54FA5BFE124CB00000013586BB31500093A809E11A93189C7BE6EBDFB8FDD15B9B7252EB741ADCA3B2ACC5FD923AEB7BDFE48A3A771338926A1F48141AF091469EE4AFC8C3E92A510BA214A407A33F469282A780E8F50F17A271E92D1FEE1A29ED427B985F9A0E00D6CDC934087716F4DEAF84AC11AA05F7587E898CA908463BDA9EC7E65D827
  Refresh timer is set for 11y13w 
3. CTS configuration on a switch.
Once PAC is downloaded, the switch can request additional CTS information (environment-data and policies):
GALA#cts refresh environment-data

GALA#show cts environment-data

State Machine is running
GALA#cts refresh policy

GALA#show cts role-based permissions 
RBACL Monitor All for Dynamic Policies : FALSE
RBACL Monitor All for Configured Policies : FALSE
You might see that there are no policies being downloaded from ISE, the reason is that CTS enforcement is not enabled on the switch:
cts role-based enforcement
cts role-based enforcement vlan-list 1-4094

GALA#show cts role-based permissions 
IPv4 Role-based permissions default:
 Permit IP-00
RBACL Monitor All for Dynamic Policies : FALSE
RBACL Monitor All for Configured Policies : FALSE
In both outputs, you could see default values - SGTs created by default (0, 2-15, 255) and default Permit IP policy.
4. Basic CTS configuration on ISE.
Create new Security Group Tags (SGTs) and few policies on ISE in order to use them later on. Navigate to Work Centers > TrustSec > Components > Security Groups, click Add to create new SGT:
To create Security Group Access Control List (SGACL) for traffic filtering, choose Security Group ACLs, as shown in the image:
Similarly, you can create other SGTs and SGACLs. Once SGTs and SGACLs are created, you can tie them together in CTS policies, to do so navigate to Work Centers > TrustSec > TustSec Policy > Egress Policy > Source Tree, as shown in the image:
5. Multiple matrices and DefCon configuration on ISE.
In this example, you have configured policies for matrix ForGALA. In order to switch between matrices, you can use the drop-down menu. In order to enable multiple matrices, navigate to Work Centers > TrustSec > Settings > Work Process Settings and enable Multiple Matrices and DefCon matrices, as shown in the image:
When this option is enabled, there is default Production matrix available, although you may create other matrices. Navigate to Work Centers > TrustSec > TrustSec Policy > Egress Policy > Matrices List and click Add:
There is an option to copy policies that should become part of the new one from the already existing matrix. Create two matrices - one for 3750X switch, another one for 3850 switch. Once matrices are created, you have to assign network devices to those matrices, because by default all TrustSec enabled network access devices are assigned to Production matrix.
To assign NADs, click Assign NADs option under Matrices List, check the device you would like to assign the matrix to and pick the created matrix from the drop-down menu and click Assign, as shown in the image:
You can do the same for other devices, followed by the click on Assign button:
Once all changes are performed, click on Close&Send, which sends all updates to devices to perform a refresh of CTS policies in order to download new ones. Similarly, create DefCon matrix, which you can copy from existing matrices:
The final policies look like:
6. SGT classification
There are two options for tags to clients assignments (create IP-SGT mappings):
static - with cts role-based sgt-map IP_address sgt tag
dynamic - via dot1x authentication (tag is assigned as a result of successful authentication)
Use both options here, two windows machines obtain SGT tag via dot1x authentication and loopback interfaces with static SGT tag. To deploy dynamic mapping, create authorization policies for end clients:
To create static IP-SGT mapping, use commands (example for GALA switch):
interface Loopback7
 ip address 7.7.7.7 255.255.255.0

interface Loopback2
 ip address 2.2.2.2 255.255.255.0

cts role-based sgt-map 2.2.2.2 sgt 15
cts role-based sgt-map 7.7.7.7 sgt 10 
After successful authentication, client hits authorization policy with specific SGT tag in a result:
GALA#show authentication sessions interface Gi1/0/11 details 
            Interface:  GigabitEthernet1/0/11
          MAC Address:  0050.5699.5bd9

       mab              Authc Success
You can check all IP-SGT mappings with command show cts role-based sgt-map all, where you see the source of every mapping (LOCAL - via dot1x authentication, CLI - static assignment):
GALA#show cts role-based sgt-map all

7. CTS policy download
Once the switch has CTS PAC and environment data is downloaded, it can request CTS policies. The switch does not download all policies, but only ones that are required - policies for traffic destined to known SGT tags - in case of GALA switch, it requests from ISE those policies:
policy for traffic to SGT 15
policy for traffic to SGT 10
policy for traffic to SGT 16
The output of all policies for GALA switch:
GALA#show cts role-based permissions 
IPv4 Role-based permissions default:
 Permit IP-00
IPv4 Role-based permissions from group 10:Point_of_Sale_Systems to group 15:BYOD:
 denyIP-20
IPv4 Role-based permissions from group 17:VLAN20 to group 16:VLAN10:
 denyIP-20
RBACL Monitor All for Dynamic Policies : FALSE
RBACL Monitor All for Configured Policies : FALSE
Switch obtains policies in two ways:
CTS refresh from the switch itself:
GALA#cts refresh policy 
Manual push from ISE:

RBACL Monitor All for Dynamic Policies : FALSE
RBACL Monitor All for Configured Policies : FALSE
Observe that policies for both switches are different (even the same policy from 10 to 15 is different for GALA and DRARORA switch). This means that traffic from SGT 10 to 15 is allowed on DRARORA, but blocked on GALA:
DRARORA#ping 15.15.15.15 source Loopback 10
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 15.15.15.15, timeout is 2 seconds:
Packet sent with a source address of 10.10.10.10 
!!!!!
Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 1/1/1 ms

GALA#ping 2.2.2.2 source Loopback 7
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 2.2.2.2, timeout is 2 seconds:
Packet sent with a source address of 7.7.7.7 
U.U.U
Success rate is 0 percent (0/5)
Similarly, from one window, you can access another one (SGT 17 -> SGT 16):
And another way (SGT 16 -> SGT 17):
To confirm that correct CTS policy was applied, check show cts role-based counters output:
GALA#sh cts role-based counters
Role-based IPv4 counters
# '-' in hardware counters field indicates sharing among cells with identical policies

GALA has 8 permitted packets (4 from ping 17->16 and 4 from ping 16->17).
DefCon deployment
When required, deploy DefCon matrix under Work Centers > TrustSec > TrustSec Policy > Egress Policy > Matrices List, check DefCon matrix you would like to activate and click on Activate:
Once DefCon is activated, menu on ISE looks like this:
And polices on switches:
GALA#show cts role-based permissions 
IPv4 Role-based permissions default:
 Permit IP-00
IPv4 Role-based permissions from group 15:BYOD to group 10:Point_of_Sale_Systems:
 denyIP-20
IPv4 Role-based permissions from group 15:BYOD to group 16:VLAN10:
 denyIP-20
IPv4 Role-based permissions from group 17:VLAN20 to group 16:VLAN10:
 denyIP-20
RBACL Monitor All for Dynamic Policies : FALSE
RBACL Monitor All for Configured Policies : FALSE

DRARORA#show cts role-based permissions 
IPv4 Role-based permissions default:
 Permit IP-00
IPv4 Role-based permissions from group 15:BYOD to group 10:Point_of_Sale_Systems:
 denyIP-20
IPv4 Role-based permissions from group 10:Point_of_Sale_Systems to group 17:VLAN20:
 permitIP-20
RBACL Monitor All for Dynamic Policies : FALSE
RBACL Monitor All for Configured Policies : FALSE
Traffic from SGT 15 to SGT 10 is not allowed on both switches:
DRARORA#ping 10.10.10.10 source Loopback 15
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.10.10.10, timeout is 2 seconds:
Packet sent with a source address of 15.15.15.15 
U.U.U
Success rate is 0 percent (0/5)

GALA#ping 7.7.7.7 source Loopback 2
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 7.7.7.7, timeout is 2 seconds:
Packet sent with a source address of 2.2.2.2 
U.U.U
Success rate is 0 percent (0/5)
Once deployment is stable again, you can deactivate DefCon and switches request the old policies. To deactivate DefCon, navigate to Work Centers > TrustSec > TrustSec Policy > Egress Policy > Matrices List, check active DefCon matrix and click on Deactivate:
Both switches request old policies immediately:
DRARORA#show cts role-based permissions
IPv4 Role-based permissions default:
 Permit IP-00
IPv4 Role-based permissions from group 17:VLAN20 to group 10:Point_of_Sale_Systems:

CTS policies
CTS policies are pushed as part of RADIUS messages, so runtime-AAA logging component set to debug on ISE (Administration > Logging > Debug Log Configuration) and below debugs on switch should be sufficient to troubleshoot any issues related to CTS:
debug cts coa
debug radius
Additionaly, check what policies are matched on the switch - on 3750X:
GALA#show cts role-based counters    
Role-based IPv4 counters
# '-' in hardware counters field indicates sharing among cells with identical policies
