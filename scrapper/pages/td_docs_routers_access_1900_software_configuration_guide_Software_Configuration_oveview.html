The Cisco 3900 series, Cisco 2900 series, and Cisco 1900 series integrated services routers (ISRs) offer secure, wire-speed delivery of concurrent data, voice, and video services. The modular design of these routers provides maximum flexibility, allowing you to configure your router to meet evolving needs.
The routers offer features such as hardware-based virtual private network (VPN) encryption acceleration, intrusion-protection and firewall functions, and optional integrated call processing and voice mail. A wide variety of legacy network modules and interfaces, service modules (SMs), internal services modules (ISMs), next-generation packet voice/data modules (PVDM3), Services Performance Engines (SPEs), high-density interfaces for a wide range of connectivity requirements, and sufficient performance and slot density for future network expansion requirements and advanced applications are available.
Power-saving hardware and software features are incorporated throughout the series. These routers provide access to the multi-gigabit fabric, which provides a connection between switch ports without using up external ports. The logical Gigabit Ethernet (GE) interface on the router connects external and internal modules through the backplane for LAN and WAN switching. Software feature upgrades are provided through software licensing.
The following sections describe the Cisco 3900 series, 2900 series, and 1900 series ISRs:

Description
Services Performance Engine
SPEs1 are modular motherboards on Cisco 3900 series ISRs. The SPE houses PVDM3 slots, system memory slots, and the ISM slot. The SPE provides a modular approach to system upgrades. You simply slide out the SPE from the router to replace internal modules, or upgrade the SPE to improve router performance. See Cisco 2900 series and 3900 series Integrated Services Routers Hardware Installation Guide for instructions.
Cryptographic Engine Accelerator
Cisco 3900 series routers with either Services Performance Engine 200 or Services Performance Engine 250 have an onboard cryptographic accelerator that is shared between SSLVPN and IPSec. By default, acceleration of SSL is disabled so IPSec performance is maximized.
See the “Configuring Security Features” section in this guide for information about enabling the SSLVPN feature.
USB Console
Cisco 3900 series, 2900 series, and 1900 series ISRs provide an additional mechanism for configuring the system through a USB2 serial console port. The traditional RJ-45 serial console port is also available.
Power Management
Some modules and interface cards that are inserted in new slots provide hardware and software power management features described below:
High efficiency AC power supplies
Electrical components with built-in power saving features, such as RAM select and clock gating
Ability to disable unused clocks to modules and peripherals
Ability to power down unused modules and put peripherals into a reset state, put front panel ports and unused internal components in a shutdown or reset state
Advanced Capability CompactFlash
Cisco 3900 series, 2900 series, and 1900 series ISRs use Advanced Capability CF3 memory to store the system image, configuration files, and some software data files.
SFP/Gigabit Ethernet Port
Cisco 2921, Cisco 2951 and Cisco 3900 Series routers have an SFP/Gigabit Ethernet port that supports copper and fiber concurrent connections. Media can be configured for failover redundancy when the network goes down. For more information, see the “Configuring Backup Data Lines and Remote Management” section.

Licensing
Cisco 3900 series, Cisco 2900 series, and Cisco 1900 series ISRs support Cisco IOS software entitlement. Your router is shipped with the software image and the corresponding permanent licenses for the technology packages and features that you specified preinstalled. You do not need to activate or register the software prior to use. If you need to upgrade or install a new technology package or feature see Software Activation on Integrated Services Router,
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/access/sw_activation/SA_on_ISR.html.
Getting Started
See the router-specific hardware installation guide to install the router in an appropriate location. Connect the router with the appropriate cables. Supply power to the router and perform the initial software configuration using Cisco Configuration Professional Express. After the initial configuration is completed, perform the following steps:
Step 1 Follow instructions in the “Basic Router Configuration” section to perform additional router configurations.
Step 2 (Optional) If you are setting up the Cisco 1941W ISR, follow instructions in the “Configuring the Wireless Device” section to configure the embedded wireless device on the router.
Step 3 Follow instructions in the “Configuring Security Features” section to configure security features on the router.
Step 4 Follow instructions in the “Unified Communications on Cisco Integrated Services Routers” section to configure Voice features on the router.
IOS Commands
Table 7 lists the Cisco IOS commands and features that can trigger an erase, write, or erase and write operation on a device's boot flash. The erase or write of an attribute on the boot flash can hold the CPU for a few milliseconds to complete the operation. The CPU hold can result in a functional impact on protocols or applications that are extremely time sensitive, for instance, Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) or routing protocols which use finely tuned short timers. For example, OSPF with fast hellos and short dead timers.
Table 7 Cisco IOS Commands
Functionality
Command Name
Description
Configuration Example
Impact
Write to NV memory.
write memory
This command writes the device's configuration in to the Non-Volatile RAM (NVRAM) on the boot flash. Use this command in privileged EXEC mode.
Router# write memory
A BFD flap is triggered when one of the following configuration elements are activated or deactivated and configuration is saved to memory:
(config)#warm-reboot
(config)#boot config
(config)#boot system
Changing the configuration register value.
config-register value
The router has a 16-bit configuration register in NVRAM. Each bit has value 1 (on or set) or value 0 (off or clear), and each bit setting affects the router behavior upon the next reload power cycle. Use this command in Global configuration mode.
Router(config)# config-register 0xvalue
Potential enough to flap bfd.
Copy running configuration to startup configuration.
copy running-config startup-config
This command copies running configuration to startup configuration.
Router# copy running-config startup-config
A BFD flap is not triggered for all 'write mem' commands. For instance, when the configuration attributes changes without either a write or an erase+write on the NVRAM, the BFD is not triggered.
In the following example, when one of the configuration elements are activated/deactivated and the configuration is saved using the 'write mem' command, the flap is triggered:
(config)#warm-reboot
(config)#boot config
(config)#boot system
Changing boot variables.
boot { bootstrap | config | host | netowrk | system }
This command configures bootstrap image file, configuration file, router specific config file, Networkwide config file or system image file.
Router(config)# boot bootstrap
Potential enough to flap bfd.
Setting the system software clock manually.
clock set hh:mm:ss day month year
To manually set the system software clock, use one of the formats of the clock set command in privileged EXEC mode.
clock set hh:mm:ss day month year
clock set hh:mm:ss month day year
Router# clock set 13:32:00 23 July 1997
Potential enough to flap bfd.
Note Every time the command is issued.
Random Entropy
No special Command exists for this.
After the system boot up, entropy is collected by accessing the security chip. This is potential enough to flap the BFD session immediately after the router boots up.
No command
Potential enough to flap bfd.
Crashing the router on user’s wish.
test crash
This is a hidden Cisco IOS command to crash the Cisco router on a user’s wish.
Router# test crash
Potential enough to flap bfd.
