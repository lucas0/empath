default-information originate (OSPF)
To generate a default external route into an Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing domain, use the default-information originate command in router configuration or router address family topology configuration mode. To disable this feature, use the no form of this command.
default-information originate { always metric metric-value | metric-type type-value }
no default-information originate { always metric metric-value | metric-type type-value }
Syntax Description
always
(Optional) Always advertises the default route regardless of whether the software has a default route.
Note
  The always keyword includes the following exception when the route map is used. When a route map is used, the origination of the default route by OSPF is not bound to the existence of a default route in the routing table and the always keyword is ignored.
metric metric-value
(Optional) Metric used for generating the default route. If you omit a value and do not specify a value using the default-metric router configuration command, the default metric value is 10. The value used is specific to the protocol.
metric-type type-value

The following example specifies a metric for the default route that is redistributed into the OSPF routing domain and specifies an external metric type of 1:
router ospf 10
 default-information originate metric-type 1
distance ospf
To define Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) route administrative distances based on route type, use the distance ospf command in router address family topology or router configuration mode. To restore the default value, use the no form of this command.
distance ospf { external dist1 | inter-area dist2 | intra-area dist3 }
no distance ospf
Syntax Description
external dist1
(Optional) Sets the distance for routes from other routing domains, learned by redistribution. Range is 1 to 255. The default value is 110.
inter-area dist2
(Optional) Sets the distance for all routes from one area to another area. Range is 1 to 255. The default value is 110.
intra-area dist3
(Optional) Sets the distance for all routes within an area. Range is 1 to 255. The default value is 110.

dist1 : 110
dist2 : 110
dist3 : 110
Command Modes
Router configuration (config-router)
Command History
Release
Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco vManage CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
For usage guidelines, see the Cisco IOS XE distance ospf command.
Router A Configuration
router ospf 1
 distance ospf external 110
  distance ospf inter-area 110
  distance ospf intra-area 110
max-metric router-lsa-ospf
To configure the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol to advertise a maximum metric so that other routers do not prefer the router as an intermediate hop in their shortest path first (SPF) calculations, use the max-metric router-lsa command. To disable the advertisement of a maximum metric, use the no form of this command.
max-metric router-lsa [ on-startup | seconds ]
no max-metric router-lsa [ on-startup | seconds ]
Syntax Description
on-startup
(Optional) Configures the router to advertise a maximum metric at startup.
seconds
(Optional) Maximum metric (in seconds) that is advertised for the specified time interval. The configurable range is from 5 to 86400 seconds. The default is 600 seconds.
Command Default
Originates router link-state advertisements (LSAs) with normal link metrics.
Command Modes
Router configuration mode (config-router)
Command History
Release
Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco vManage CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
Use the max-metric router-lsa command to originate LSAs with a maximum metric (LSInfinity: 0xFFFF) through all nonstub links. This command allows Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing tables to converge without attracting transit traffic (if there are not alternate lower cost paths to the router). The router advertises accurate (normal) metrics after the configured or default timers expire or after BGP sends a notification that routing tables have converged.

Note
Directly connected links in a stub network are not affected by the configuration of a maximum or infinite metric because the cost of a stub link is always set to the output interface cost.
You can use the max-metric router-lsa command in the following situations:
Reloading a router. After a router is reloaded, Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) converge very quickly, and other routers may try to forward traffic through the newly reloaded router. If the router is still building BGP routing tables, the packets that are destined for other networks that the router has not learned through BGP may be dropped.
Introducing a router into a network without routing traffic through it. You might want to connect a router to an OSPF network but not want real traffic to flow through the router if there are better alternate paths. If no alternate paths exist, then this router would still accept transit traffic.
This command requires the LAN Base Services license.
This example shows how to configure a router that is running OSPF to advertise a maximum metric for 100 seconds:
Device(config)# router ospf 100
Device(config-router)# max-metric router-lsa on-startup 100
router-id
To use a fixed router ID, use the router-id command in router configuration mode. To force Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) to use the previous OSPF router ID behavior, use the no form of this command.
router-id ip-address
no router-id ip-address
Syntax Description
ip-address
Router ID in IP address format.
Command Default
No OSPF routing process is defined.
Command Modes
Router configuration (config-router)
Command History
Release
Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco vManage CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
For usage guidelines, see the Cisco IOS XE router-id command.
The following example specifies a fixed router-id:
router-id 10.1.1.1
router ospf
To configure an Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing process, use the router ospf command in global configuration mode. To terminate an OSPF routing process, use the no form of this command.
router ospf process-id
no router ospf process-id
Syntax Description
process-id
Internally used identification parameter for an OSPF routing process. It is locally assigned and can be any positive integer. A unique value is assigned for each OSPF routing process.
Command Default
No OSPF routing process is defined.
Command Modes
Global configuration (config)
Command History
Release
Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v

The following example configures an OSPF routing process and assign a process number of 10:
Router(config)# router ospf 10
timers throttle spf
To turn on Open Shortest Path First ( OSPF) shortest path first (SPF) throttling, use the timers throttle spf command in the appropriate configuration mode. To turn off OSPF SPF throttling, use the no form of this command.
timers throttle spf spf-start spf-hold spf-max-wait
no timers throttle spf spf-start spf-hold spf-max-wait
Syntax Description
