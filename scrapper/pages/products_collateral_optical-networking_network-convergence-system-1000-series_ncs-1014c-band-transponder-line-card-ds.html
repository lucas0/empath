Cisco Capital
    It’s a 5G and web-scale era, and every second, a million minutes of video content crosses the network. The continuous expansion of Internet usage is driven by social networking, video streaming and downloads, business productivity, e-commerce, and gaming. To keep up with demand, hyperscalers, communication service providers, and enterprises need to rapidly scale their networks. Designing networks with scalability, operational efficiency, security and reliability in mind is essential. Cisco’s 2.4Tbps multi-haul transponder along with CIM 8 (Coherent Interface Module 8) uses state-of-the-art silicon, silicon photonics and Opto-Electronic Multi-Chip Module (OE-MCM) package along with complete automation and real-time visibility to deliver best-in-class power and performance for metro, long-haul, and submarine applications while being simple to deploy and manage.
Product features and benefits
The all new NCS 2.4T transponder is supported in the NCS 1014 chassis, providing six QSFP-DD client ports for 100/400 and 800G protocols. The client ports map to two trunk ports operating any rate between 400G and 1.2T in 100G increments.
The trunk ports are CIM 8 (Coherent Interconnect Module 8) and are pluggable and field replaceable without removing the line card. The CIM 8 is a next generation multi-haul optical transport product allowing the solution to be used for metro, terrestrial long-haul, or submarine applications:
●      Continuous variable baud rate from 60Gbaud to 140+Gbaud.
●      2nd generation 3D shaping enabled transmission performance closer to Shannon limit.
●      Best in class Soft Decision Forward Error Correction (SD-FEC) algorithms.
●      Trunk line rate from 400G to 1.2T in 100G increments.

Cisco NCS 1014 2.4T C-band line card
The Cisco NCS 1014 2.4T transponder provides the following hardware benefits:
●      Support of continuous variable baud rate and shaping to maximize spectral efficiency.
●      One universal transponder that is performance optimized for metro, long-haul, and submarine applications.
●      Support for >400,000 ps/nm of CD compensation, enable unregenerated 400GE subsea transmission > 18,000km.
●      Transport of 100GE, OTU4, 400GE, and 800GE on the same platform through software provisioning.
●      2.4T DWDM provides unparalleled scale and density—with up to 76.8Tbps per fiber pair in C+L band.
●      State-of-the-art AES-256 encryption at scale—9.6 Tbps of encrypted trunk capacity per 2RU.
●      Nonlinear compensation for maximum performance and capacity on long haul and subsea transmission.
●      DSP enabled real-time fiber sensing and monitoring applications.
●      Availability in C-band and L-band with the same line card.
●      Ability to introduce CIM8 pluggables as per the capacity demands.
●      Dual card mode to split client across 4 trunk ports with 400GE/800GE clients.
Wavelength tunability
The line interface supports software-provisionable tunability across the entire C- and L-band from 191.25 to 196.10 THz and 184.48 to 191.56 THz, respectively, as enabled by separate CIM 8 modules. Grid-less tuning support allows for continuous tunability in increments of 0.1 GHz and the ability to create multicarrier super-channels over flex spectrum line systems.
Protocol transparency
The Cisco NCS 1014 2.4T transponder can transparently deliver 400GbE and 100GE/OTU4 clients over two trunks from 400G to 1.2T.
Encryption
With increasing asks for data privacy and data protection across the globe, encryption of any data that leaves the data center facility is becoming an important requirement for cloud operators. The NCS 1014 2.4T line card provides AES256-based Layer-1 encryption for 100/400GE and OTU4. IKEv2 is used for authentication of the devices in an encryption session, and the protocol provides pre-shared keys, certificates, or 802.1X-based authentication options. The Elliptical Curve Diffie Hillman (ECDH) Key Exchange protocol runs over a GCC (Generic Communication Channel) between two NCS 1014 2.4T line cards.
Management
The Cisco NCS 1014 2.4T line card supports all management feature as mentioned in the NCS 1014 system data sheet.
Performance monitoring and management
The Cisco NCS 1014 2.4T line card supports performance monitoring of optical parameters on the client and DWDM line interface including laser bias current, transmit, and receive optical power. Ethernet RMON statistics for the client ports and OTN error counters for the trunk are also available. Calculation and accumulation of the performance-monitoring data are supported in 30sec, 15-minute and 24-hour intervals as per G.7710. Physical system parameters measured at the wavelength level, such as mean polarization mode dispersion, accumulated chromatic dispersion, pre-FEC Bit Error Rate, and received Optical Signal-to-Noise Ratio (OSNR), are also included in the set of performance-monitoring parameters. These parameters can greatly simplify troubleshooting operations. Additionally, NCS 1014 2.4T Transponder supports PRBS patterns of 31, 23, 15, and 7, which allows users to perform data integrity checks between trunk links without enabling actual client traffic.
OpenConfig protocols for management GNMI and operations GNOI are also supported for efficient manageability and programmability. GNOI based operational commands for system reboot, file transfers, certificate authentication, loopbacks, LLDP and BERT are supported. The Cisco NCS 1014 2.4T line card provides a set of native YANG models as well as the ability to map into any industry-standard or customer-defined YANG data models. For monitoring, the card provides a streaming telemetry feature that relies on a push mechanism to disseminate user-selected PM and status information at user-specified frequencies at granular 10-second intervals. This improves monitoring speed and scale compared to traditional pull-based mechanisms such as SNMP. The telemetry infrastructure also allows for events such as alarms, and port-state changes to be notified.
Protection options
Using a PSM and a Y-cable, the NCS 1014 2.4T Transponder offers client protection. Line-side protection is also accessible via a PSM module.
