Chapter: Configure Smart Licensing and Smart Call Home Services
Chapter Contents
Smart Call Home
Smart Call Home
Smart Call Home (SCH) monitors Cisco ISE devices in your network and notifies you via email about the critical events. Emails contain real-time alerts with environmental information and remediation advice.
When you activate Smart Licensing from Cisco ISE, the SCH capabilities are enabled by default. Otherwise, to enable SCH, you must register Cisco ISE for the SCH service. See Register for Smart Call Home Service for information on how to enable the SCH feature.
After you activate Smart Licensing or register for the SCH service, you can choose to do one of the following:
Enable only Anonymous Reporting. The Anonymous Reporting feature of SCH provides minimal health information about the Cisco ISE devices in your network.
Enable the full set of features offered by SCH.
For more information about enabling the SCH capabilities, see Register for Smart Call Home Service.

Smart Call Home Profiles
Smart Call Home profiles determine the types of events that are monitored on your device. Cisco ISE includes the following default profiles:
ciscotac-1 - Used for anonymous reporting
isesch-1 - Used for Smart Call Home functionality
You cannot edit the default profile that is used for anonymous reporting (ciscotac-1).
Anonymous Reporting
Cisco ISE securely collects non-sensitive information about your deployment, network access devices, profiler, and other services that you are using. This data is collected to better understand Cisco ISE usage and to improve the product and the various services that it offers.
By default, anonymous reporting is enabled. If you want to disable anonymous reporting, you can do so from the ISE Admin Portal (Administration > System > Settings > Smart Call Home).
Register for Smart Call Home Service

Note
If you have activated Smart Licensing from Cisco ISE, you don't have to register for the Smart Call Home (SCH) service. With Smart Licensing, the SCH capabilities are enabled by default. The Registration Status in the Smart Call Home page would be Active. You can choose to enable only Anonymous Reporting or enable the full set of features offered by SCH.
To enable SCH services without Smart Licensing, you must first register Cisco ISE for the SCH service. You can only do so from a standalone node or a Primary Administration Node.
