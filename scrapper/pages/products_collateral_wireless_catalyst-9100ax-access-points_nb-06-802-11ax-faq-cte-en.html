    Technology overview
Q.  What is Wi-Fi 6?
A.  The IEEE 802.11ax standard is the latest step in a journey of nonstop innovation. It builds on the strengths of 802.11ac while adding flexibility and scalability that lets new and existing networks power next-generation applications. IEEE 802.11ax couples the freedom and high speed of Gigabit Ethernet wireless with the reliability and predictability we find in licensed radio.
Q.  What is Wi-Fi 6E?
A.  At its base, Wi-Fi 6E is simply an extension of Wi-Fi 6 into the 6-GHz spectrum. Since the spectrum is new and accepts only Wi-Fi 6E devices, it doesn’t have any of the old issues currently clogging up existing networks. Wi-Fi 6E is part of the Wi-Fi 6 standard; it’s a technology bump that provides a lot of network benefits.
Q.  Is Wi-Fi 6 different from 802.11ax?
A.  The Wi-Fi Alliance has started a campaign to use the term “Wi-Fi 6” when referring to the IEEE 802.11ax standard, indicating the sixth generation of Wi-Fi. The goal is to simplify the marketing message to better position Wi-Fi relative to the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards used in cellular such as 5G which is the 5th Generation of 3GPP. The Wi-Fi 6 name is becoming very common now due to its simplicity. However, 802.11ax is interchangeable with Wi-Fi 6.
Q.  How is Wi-Fi 6E different from Wi-Fi 6?
A.  Wi-Fi 6E is not a new wireless standard; it’s simply a new Wi-Fi Alliance (WFA) terminology that refers to an additional 1200 MHz of spectrum (in the US) and an additional 500 MHz of spectrum (in the EU and some Asian countries – as of Spring 2022) 6-GHz band (in the US) for Wi-Fi 6. Wi-Fi 6E has all the same great features of today’s Wi-Fi 6, such as Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) and Multiuser Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO), except that it’s capable of operating in the 60GHz band.
Q.  What additional features can I expect from Wi-Fi 6?
A.  Cisco, along with other vendors, has been working with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) on the Wi-Fi 6 standard. Wi-Fi 6 builds on the success of 802.11ac, delivering a better experience in typical environments and more predictable performance for advanced applications such as 4K or 8K video; high-density, high-definition collaboration apps; all-wireless offices; and the Internet of Things (IoT). Wi-Fi 6 drives Wi-Fi toward the future as the growth of wireless continues. You can get more information about the standard from our technical white paper.
Q.  Is Wi-Fi 6 backward compatible with previous generations of Wi-Fi?
A.  In Wi-Fi 6, all devices must also support all the mandatory 802.11a, b, g, n, and ac modes of operation. This ensures that Wi-Fi 6 Access Points (APs) and clients are backward compatible with legacy APs and clients.
Q.  Will Wi-Fi 6E be backward compatible with previous generations of Wi-Fi?
A.  No. Part of what makes Wi-Fi 6E so special is that it provides a new greenfield spectrum in the 6-GHz band, which can be dedicated for truly mission-critical applications that need the low latency, high speed, and additional security that come with having only Wi-Fi 6E devices on the network.
Q.  Will Wi-Fi 6 be allowed in all countries and regulatory domains?
A.  All countries and regulatory domains that allow 802.11n and 802.11ac will also allow Wi-Fi 6.
Q.  Will Wi-Fi 6E be allowed in all countries and regulatory domains?
A.  Yes and no. Agencies in some countries, including the regulatory agency for the United States (the FCC) have adopted rules opening a 1200-MHz spectrum in the 6-GHz band (from 5.925 GHz up to 7.125 GHz) for unlicensed Wi-Fi. In Europe, the regulatory bodies have released 500 MHz of 6-GHz spectrum (5.925 GHz to 6.425 GHz) for Wi-Fi use. And other countries haven’t opened the spectrum at all. It is expected that other countries will follow suit and open portions of this band at future dates. However, it is important to check to see where your country lands when it comes to Wi-Fi 6E.
Q.  Are my current mobile/client devices that use Wi-Fi 6 supported? When will mobile devices support Wi-Fi 6?
A.  Leading mobile vendors and Cisco partners Apple, Intel, Microsoft, and Samsung have released a complete portfolio of Wi-Fi 6 products. Keep in mind that you need both an access point and clients that support Wi-Fi 6 in order to realize the benefits of this standard.
Q.  Which Cisco access points support Wi-Fi 6?
A.  Cisco Catalyst 9100 enterprise-class access points support Wi-Fi 6 capabilities, extending the power of intent-based networking with hardware and software innovations. The Cisco Catalyst 9100 APs offer resiliency and security while enabling intelligence at the network edge.
