Product Overview
The Cisco UCS® C420 M3 Rack Server (Figure 1) is a high-density, 4-socket, 2-rack-unit (2RU) rack server designed for computing, I/O, storage, and memory-intensive standalone applications. The Cisco UCS C420 M3 extends the capabilities of the Cisco Unified Computing System™ (Cisco UCS) using Intel Xeon processor E5-4600 Series multicore processors to deliver increased performance and efficiency.
The Cisco UCS C420 M3 is part of the Cisco UCS solution, which combines rack and blade servers with networking and storage access into a single unified system. Centrally configured through unified, model-based management, Cisco UCS simplifies and accelerates deployment of enterprise-class applications running in bare-metal, virtualized, and cloud-computing environments.
Designed for enterprise-class performance and scalability, the Cisco UCS C420 M3 combines the advantages of 4‑socket computing with the cost-effective Intel Xeon processor E5-4600 product family for demanding virtualization, database, and high-end high-performance computing (HPC) workloads. The dense and expandable Cisco UCS C420 M3 is a balanced, high-performance platform that complements the Cisco UCS Rack Server portfolio. The 2RU Cisco UCS C420 M3 supports 48 DIMM slots, 16 disk drives, seven PCIe expansion slots, and four 1 Gigabit Ethernet LAN-on-motherboard (LOM) ports. It uses unique Cisco UCS and virtual interface card (VIC) technology and delivers one-wire participation in Cisco UCS domains. The Cisco UCS C420 M3 interfaces with Cisco UCS using another Cisco innovation: the Cisco UCS VIC 1225. The Cisco UCS VIC 1225 is a dual-port Enhanced Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP+) 10 Gigabit Ethernet and Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE)-capable PCI Express (PCIe) card designed exclusively for Cisco UCS C-Series Rack Servers. It incorporates Cisco’s next-generation converged network adapter (CNA), providing investment protection for feature releases. The card enables a policy-based, stateless, agile server infrastructure that can present up to 256 PCIe standards-compliant interfaces to the host that can be dynamically configured as either network interface cards (NICs) or host bus adapters (HBAs). In addition, the Cisco UCS VIC 1225 supports Cisco® Data Center Virtual Machine Fabric Extender (VM-FEX) technology, which extends the Cisco UCS fabric interconnect ports to virtual machines, simplifying server virtualization deployment.

Applications
The Cisco UCS C420 M3 Rack Server continues Cisco’s commitment to delivering uniquely differentiated value, fabric integration, and ease of management that is exceptional in the marketplace for enterprise-class, storage-intensive applications:
●   Collaboration
●   Databases
●   Virtualization and consolidation
●   Enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer resource management (CRM)
●   High-end HPC
Cisco UCS Servers Change the Economics of the Data Center
IT infrastructure matters now more than ever, as organizations seek to achieve the full potential of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), bare metal, virtualized servers, and cloud computing. Cisco continues to lead in data center innovation with the introduction of new building blocks for Cisco UCS that extend its exceptional simplicity, agility, and efficiency (Figure 2), including innovations such as the Cisco UCS C420 M3 Rack Server.
Figure 2.      Cisco UCS Components
Cisco innovations, such as Cisco UCS Manager, allows administrators to create a software definition for a desired server (using Cisco service profiles and templates) and then instantiate that server and its I/O connectivity by associating a service profile with physical resources. This approach contrasts with the traditional method of configuring each system resource manually, one at a time, through individual element managers. Unlike with the products of other vendors, Cisco service profiles can be moved from rack server to rack or blade server, or between blade or rack servers in different chassis. In other words, Cisco UCS Manager and service profiles are form-factor agnostic. Other Cisco UCS building blocks include enhanced server I/O options and expanded Cisco UCS fabric interconnects that extend scalability and management simplicity for both blade and rack systems across bare-metal, virtualized, and cloud-computing environments. Cisco helps ensure that nearly all parts of Cisco UCS offer investment protection and are backward compatible. For example, fabric extenders can be upgraded using the same fabric interconnects and the same Cisco UCS VIC 1225. Fabric interconnect hardware can be upgraded independently of fabric extenders and blade chassis. Cisco continues to innovate in all these areas, helping ensure that both now and in the future, more powerful rack servers with larger, faster memory have adequate I/O bandwidth and computing power. Cisco completes this vision through continuous innovation in VIC, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), fabric extender, fabric interconnect, blade server, blade chassis, and rack-server technologies and in the form-factor-agnostic Cisco UCS Manager software that ties all these ever-advancing hardware pieces together.
The Cisco UCS C420 M3 is also part of a large family of rack servers: the Cisco C-Series Rack Servers. Designed to operate both in standalone environments and as part of Cisco UCS, the Cisco UCS C-Series servers employ Cisco technology to help customers handle the most challenging workloads. The Cisco UCS C-Series complements a standards-based unified network fabric with Cisco Data Center VM-FEX virtualization support, Cisco UCS Manager Software, Cisco fabric extender and fabric interconnect architectures, and Cisco Extended Memory Technology. Again, Cisco is innovating across all these technologies. With Cisco UCS architectural advantages, software advances, continuous innovation, and unique blade server and chassis designs, Cisco UCS is the first truly unified data center platform. In addition, Cisco UCS can transform IT departments through policy-based automation and deep integration with familiar systems management and orchestration tools.
