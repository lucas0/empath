Cisco Interfaces and Modules
Cisco Services Modules
Cisco delivers the vision of integrated network security by offering a suite of advanced security modules including Firewall, IPSec VPNs, SSL, and gigabit network analysis modules into the Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series switches. By expanding on the Cisco SAFE Blueprint to include the Cisco Catalyst 6500 series, these capabilities enable more integrated, highly available, adaptive, and scalable security for network connectivity, services, and applications. These capabilities enable enterprises and service providers to achieve productivity gains and reduce their network operating costs.
Cisco Catalyst security and virtual private network (VPN) systems provide turnkey solutions for deploying high-performance firewall or VPN services in enterprise and service-provider environments. The product line consists of four easy-to-order, preconfigured systems--two firewall security systems and two IP Security (IPSec) VPN systems, all based on the market-leading Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series--meeting a broad range of operational and expandability requirements. The systems come fully integrated with a processor, a high-performance firewall or VPN service engine, and dual Gigabit-Ethernet interfaces.
