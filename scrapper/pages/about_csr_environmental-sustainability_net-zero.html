Our Emissions GoalsOur PlanThird-Party ValidationNews
Climate science says we must limit global temperature rise to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels to avoid the worst effects of climate change. Cisco is taking steps to help achieve this goal.
Our goals
We have set near- and long-term, science-based targets to reduce our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
2025
90% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2025*
*Compared to Fiscal Year 2019 (FY19). We will neutralize any remaining emissions by removing an equal amount from the atmosphere
2030
30% reduction in Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services, upstream transportation and distribution, and use of sold products by 2030**
**Compared to FY19
2040
Net zero GHG emissions across our value chain by 2040***
***By reducing our absolute Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 90% compared to FY19 and neutralizing any remaining emissions by removing an equal amount from the atmosphere

Validating our goal
Third-party validation
Cisco's 2040 net-zero target and near- and long-term targets are approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) under its new Net-Zero Standard, the world's first framework for corporate net-zero target setting in line with climate science. This builds on our history of setting meaningful goals, measuring our progress and impact, and reporting on them transparently.
Evolution of our net-zero commitment
We publicly announced net-zero goals in September 2021. In July 2022, we enhanced those goals to achieve third-party validation from SBTi. Specifically, we 1) refined the language used to describe our near-term Scope 1 & 2 emissions goal for 2025 to be more specific and to align with SBTi methodology, and 2) we set an additional near-term Scope 3 emissions goal for 2030 to address the use of sold products, which is the largest source of our emissions.
