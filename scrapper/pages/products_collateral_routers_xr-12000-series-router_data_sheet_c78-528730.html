Product Overview
The Cisco ® XR 12000 Performance Router Processor-3 (PRP-3, Figure 1) is the premium route processor for the Cisco XR 12000 Series Routers, addressing the unique route processing requirements of carrier-grade IP and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) packet infrastructures. It also provides a Building Integrated Timing Supply (BITS) interface, a component of the Cisco XR 12000 Series BITS architecture that will enable network service synchronization on the platform in the future.
This premium route processor is responsible for the following functions:
• Executing routing protocol stacks
• Performing all protocol communications with other routers
• Building and distributing forwarding information to all line cards
• Uploading the OS software system images to all installed line cards upon powering up
• Providing out-of-band system console and auxiliary ports and Ethernet ports for router configuration and maintenance
• Monitoring and managing the power and temperature of system components such as line cards, power supplies, and fans
