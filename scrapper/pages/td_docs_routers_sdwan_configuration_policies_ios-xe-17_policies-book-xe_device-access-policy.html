Device Access Policy on SNMP and SSH
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r
This feature defines the rules that traffic must meet to pass through an interface. When you define rules for incoming traffic, they are applied to the traffic before any other policies are applied. The control plane of a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device processes the data traffic for local services (like SSH and SNMP) from a set of sources. Routing packets are required to form the overlay.

Device Access Policy Overview
Starting from Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Release 17.2.1r, the Cisco vManage user interface is enhanced to configure device access policy on all the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
The control plane of Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices process the data traffic for local services like, SSH and SNMP, from a set of sources. It is important to protect the CPU from device access traffic by applying the filter to avoid malicious traffic.
Access policies define the rules that traffic must meet to pass through an interface. When you define rules for incoming traffic, they are applied to the traffic before any other policies are applied. You can use access policies, in routed and transparent firewall mode to control IP traffic. An access rule permits or denies traffic based on the protocol used, the source and destination IP address or network, and optionally, the users and user groups. Each incoming packet at an interface is analyzed to determine if it must be forwarded or dropped based on criteria you specify. If you define access rules for the outgoing traffic, packets are also analyzed before they are allowed to leave an interface. Access policies are applied in order. That is, when the device compares a packet to the rules, it searches from top to bottom in the access policies list, and applies the policy for the first matched rule, ignoring all subsequent rules (even if a later rule is a better match). Thus, you should place specific rules above more general rules to ensure the specific rules are not skipped.
Configure Device Access Policy Using Cisco vManage
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices support device access policy configuration to handle SNMP and SSH traffic directed towards the control plane. Use Cisco vManage to configure destination ports based on the device access policy.

Note
In order to allow connections to devices from Tools > SSH Terminal in Cisco vManage, create a rule to accept Device Access Protocol as SSH and Source Data Prefix as 192.168.1.5/32.
To configure localized device access control policies, use the Cisco vManage policy configuration wizard.
Configure specific or all components depending on the specific policy you are creating. To skip a component, click the Next button. To return to a component, click the Back button at the bottom of the screen.
To configure a device access policy:
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Policies.
Click Localized Policy and from the Custom Options drop-down, under Localized Policy, select Access Control Lists.
From the Add Device Access Policy drop-down list, select Add IPv4 Device Access Policy or Add IPv6 Device Access Policy option to add a device.

Note
Beginning with Cisco IOS XE Release 17.9.1a and Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1, if you configure an IPv4 or an IPv6 device access policy with no policy sequences and only a default action of Accept or Drop, the device access policy creates an SSH and an SNMP configuration. You can now create a device access policy with only a default action and with no policy sequences to create a device configuration or a Cisco vManage configuration for both SSH and SNMP.
If you do not create an SNMP server configuration, the SNMP configuration created by the device access policy is unused.
Prior to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.9.1a and Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1, if you configured a device access policy with only a default action of Accept or Drop and with no policy sequences, the device access policy would not create a device configuration or a Cisco vManage configuration.
Select Add IPv4 Device Access Policy from the drop-down list to add an IPv4 ACL Policy. The edit Device IPv4 ACL Policy page appears.
Enter the name and the description for the new policy.
Click Add ACL Sequence to add a sequence. The Device Access Control List page is displayed.
Click Sequence Rule. Match and Actions options are displayed.
Click Match, select and configure the following conditions for your ACL policy:
Match Condition
Description
Device Access Protocol (required)
Select a carrier from the drop-down list. For example SNMP, SSH.
Source Data Prefix
Enter the source IP address. For example, 10.0.0.0/12.
Source Port
Enter the list of source ports. The range is 0-65535.
Destination Data Prefix
Enter the destination IP address. For example, 10.0.0.0/12.
VPN
Enter the VPN ID. The range is 0-65536.
Click Actions, configure the following conditions for your ACL policy:
Action Condition
Description
Accept
Counter Name
Enter the counter name to be accepted. The maximum length can be 20 characters.
Drop
Counter Name
Enter the counter name to drop. The maximum length can be 20 characters.
Click Save Match And Actions to save all the conditions for the ACL policy.
Click Save Device Access Control List Policy to apply the selected match conditions to an action.
If no packets match, then any of the route policy sequence rules. The Default Action in the left pane is to drop the packets.

Note
IPv6 prefix match is not supported on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. When you try to configure IPv6 prefix matches on these devices, Cisco vManage fails to generate device configuration.
Configure Device Access Policy Using the CLI
Configuration:
ip access-list standard snmp-acl
 1 permit 10.0.1.12 255.255.255.0
 11 deny any
!
snmp-server community private view v2 ro snmp-acl
ip access-list extended ssh-acl
 1 permit tcp host 10.0.1.12 any eq 22
 11 deny tcp any any eq 22
!
line vty 0 4
 access-class ssh-acl in vrf-also
!

Note
IPv6 prefix match is not supported on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
Examples for ACL Statistics and Counters
To configure ACL statistics and counters using yang:
Yang file: Cisco-IOS-XE-acl-oper.yang
 
  grouping ace-oper-data {
    description
      "ACE operational data";
    leaf match-counter {
      type yang:counter64;
      description
        "Number of matches for an access list entry";
    }
  }
Example configuration using yang model:
Router# show access-lists access-list ACL-1
ACCESS
CONTROL
LIST     RULE  MATCH
NAME     NAME  COUNTER
------------------------
ACL-1    1     0
         2     0
 
Router# show access-lists access-list ACL-1 | display xml
<config xmlns="http://tail-f.com/ns/config/1.0">
  <access-lists xmlns="http://cisco.com/ns/yang/Cisco-IOS-XE-acl-oper">
  <access-list>
    <access-control-list-name>ACL-1</access-control-list-name>
    <access-list-entries>
      <access-list-entry>
        <rule-name>1</rule-name>
        <access-list-entries-oper-data>
          <match-counter>0</match-counter>
        </access-list-entries-oper-data>
      </access-list-entry>
      <access-list-entry>
        <rule-name>2</rule-name>
        <access-list-entries-oper-data>
          <match-counter>0</match-counter>
        </access-list-entries-oper-data>
      </access-list-entry>
    </access-list-entries>
  </access-list>
  </access-lists>
</config>
Router#
To display ACL statistics and counters using the CLI, use the command:
show ip access-list [access-list-number | access-list-name]
Example statistics output using the CLI:
show ip access-list [access-list-number | access-list-name]
 
Router# show ip access-list ACL-1
Extended IP access list ACL-1
10 permit ip host 10.1.1.1 any (3 matches) 30
30 permit ip host 10.2.2.2 any (27 matches)
 
 

To clear counters in ACL stats:
 
clear ip access-list counters {access-list-number | access-list-name}
Verifying ACL Policy on an SNMP Server
Starting from the Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r release, Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices support the device-access-policy feature on SNMP servers. In case of SNMP, Cisco vManage validates to block the template push on the device if the SNMP feature template is not configured.
Configuration:
snmp-server community private view v2 ro snmp-acl
Yang model for the command snmp-server community . Following is the ACL settings sample from the yang model:
container community {
          description
            "Configure a SNMP v2c Community string and access privs";
          tailf:cli-compact-syntax;
          tailf:cli-sequence-commands;
          leaf community-string {
            tailf:cli-drop-node-name;
            type string;
          }
          container access {
            tailf:cli-drop-node-name;
            tailf:cli-flatten-container;
            leaf standard-acl {
              tailf:cli-drop-node-name;
              tailf:cli-full-command;
              type uint32 {
                range "1..99";
              }
            }
            leaf expanded-acl {
              tailf:cli-drop-node-name;
              tailf:cli-full-command;
              type uint32 {
                range "1300..1999";
              }
            }
            leaf acl-name {
              tailf:cli-drop-node-name;
              tailf:cli-full-command;
              type string;
            }
            leaf ipv6 {
              description
                "Specify IPv6 Named Access-List";
              tailf:cli-full-command;
              type string;
            }
            leaf ro {
              description
                "Read-only access with this community string";
              type empty;
            }
            leaf rw {
              description
                "Read-write access with this community string";
              type empty;
            }
          }
        }
Following is the sample test log for snmp-server ACL settings:

Verifying ACL Policy on SSH
Starting from the Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r release, the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices support device-access-policy features on SSH servers using Virtual Teletype (VTY) lines. Cisco vManage uses all the available VTY lines in the backend and pushes the policy accordingly.
Configuration:
line vty 0 4
 access-class ssh-acl in vrf-also
!
Following is the ACL settings sample from the yang model:
// line * / access-class
    container access-class {
      description
        "Filter connections based on an IP access list";
      tailf:cli-compact-syntax;
      tailf:cli-sequence-commands;
      tailf:cli-reset-container;
      tailf:cli-flatten-container;
      list acccess-list {
        tailf:cli-drop-node-name;
        tailf:cli-compact-syntax;
        tailf:cli-reset-container;
        tailf:cli-suppress-mode;
        tailf:cli-delete-when-empty;
        key "direction";
        leaf direction {
          type enumeration {
            enum "in";
            enum "out";
          }
        }
        leaf access-list {
          tailf:cli-drop-node-name;
          tailf:cli-prefix-key;
          type ios-types:exp-acl-type;
          mandatory true;
        }
        leaf vrf-also {
          description
            "Same access list is applied for all VRFs";
          type empty;
        }
      }
    }
