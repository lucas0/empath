Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center Compatibility Guide
This guide provides software and hardware compatibility for the Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center. For related compatibility guides, see Additional Resources.

Note
Not all software versions, especially patches, apply to all platforms. A quick way to tell if a version is supported is that its upgrade/installation packages are posted on the Cisco Support & Download site. If the site is "missing" an upgrade or installation package, that version is not supported. You can also check the release notes and End-of-Life Announcements. If you feel a version is missing in error, contact Cisco TAC.

Device Management
Customer-Deployed Management Center
All devices support remote management with a customer-deployed management center, which must run the same or newer version as its managed devices. This means:
You can manage older devices with a newer management center, usually a few major versions back. However, we recommend you always update your entire deployment. New features and resolved issues often require the latest release on both the management center and its managed devices.
You cannot upgrade a device past the management center. Even for maintenance (third-digit) releases, you must upgrade the management center first.
Note that in most cases you can upgrade an older device directly to the management center's major or maintenance version. However, sometimes you can manage an older device that you cannot directly upgrade, even though the target version is supported on the device. And rarely, there are issues with specific management center-device combinations. For release-specific requirements, see the release notes.

Cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center
The cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center can manage threat defense devices running:
Version 7.2+
Version 7.0.3 and later maintenance releases
The cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center cannot manage threat defense devices running Version 7.1, or Classic devices running any version. You cannot upgrade a cloud-managed device from Version 7.0.x to Version 7.1 unless you unregister and disable cloud management. We recommend you upgrade the device directly to Version 7.2+.
You can add a cloud-managed device to a Version 7.2+ customer-deployed management center for event logging and analytics purposes only. Or, you can send security events to the Cisco cloud with Security Analytics and Logging (SaaS).

BIOS and Firmware for Management Center Hardware
We provide updates for BIOS and RAID controller firmware on management center hardware. If your management center does not meet the requirements, apply the appropriate hotfix. If your management center model and version are not listed and you think you need to update, contact Cisco TAC.

BIOS Update Hotfix EI
Hotfixing is the only way to update the BIOS and RAID controller firmware. Upgrading the software does not accomplish this task, nor does reimaging to a later version. If the management center is already up to date, the hotfix has no effect.

Tip
These hotfixes also update the CIMC firmware; for resolved issues see Release Notes for Cisco UCS Rack Server Software. Note that in general, we do not support changing configurations on the management center using CIMC. However, to enable logging of invalid CIMC usernames, apply the latest hotfix, then follow the instructions in the Viewing Faults and Logs chapter in the Cisco UCS C-Series Servers Integrated Management Controller CLI Configuration Guide, Version 4.0 or later.
Use the regular upgrade process to apply hotfixes. For hotfix release notes, which include quicklinks to the Cisco Support & Download site, see the Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense/Firepower Hotfix Release Notes.

Note
The management center web interface may display these hotfixes with a version that is different from (usually later than) the current software version. This is expected behavior and the hotfixes are safe to apply.
Determining BIOS and Firmware Versions
To determine the current versions on the management center, run these commands from the Linux shell/expert mode:
BIOS: sudo dmidecode -t bios -q
RAID controller firmware (FMC 4500): sudo MegaCLI -AdpAllInfo -aALL | grep "FW Package"
RAID controller firmware (all other models): sudo storcli /c0 show | grep "FW Package"
Management Center Virtual
With the management center virtual, you can purchase licenses that enable you to manage 2, 10, 25, or 300 devices. For full details on supported instances, see the Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center Virtual Getting Started Guide.

Bundled Components
These tables list the versions of various components bundled with the management center. Use this information to identify open or resolved bugs in bundled components that may affect your deployment.
Note that sometimes we release updated builds for select releases. If bundled components change from build to build, we list the components in the latest build. (In most cases, only the latest build is available for download.) For details on new builds and the issues they resolve, see the release notes for your version.
Snort
Snort is the main inspection engine. Snort 3 requires threat defense.

System Databases
The vulnerability database (VDB) is a database of known vulnerabilities to which hosts may be susceptible, as well as fingerprints for operating systems, clients, and applications. The system uses the VDB to help determine whether a particular host increases your risk of compromise.
The geolocation database (GeoDB) is a database that you can leverage to view and filter traffic based on geographical location.

Integrated Products
The Cisco products listed below may have other compatibility requirements, for example, they may need to run on specific hardware, or on a specific operating system. For that information, see the documentation for the appropriate product.

Note
Whenever possible, we recommend you use the latest (newest) compatible version of each integrated product. This ensures that you have the latest features, bug fixes, and security patches.
Identity Services and User Control
Note that with:
Cisco ISE and ISE-PIC: We list the versions of ISE and ISE-PIC for which we provide enhanced compatibility testing, although other combinations may work.
Cisco Firepower User Agent: Version 6.6 is the last management center release to support the user agent software as an identity source; this blocks upgrade to Version 6.7+.

Note
In Version 6.2.3+, uninstalling a patch (fourth-digit release) results in an appliance running the version you upgraded from. This means that you can end up running a deprecated version simply by uninstalling a later patch. Unless otherwise stated, do not remain at a deprecated version. Instead, we recommend you upgrade. If upgrade is impossible, uninstall the deprecated patch.

Cisco Firepower User Agent
Version 6.6 is the last release to support the Cisco Firepower User Agent software as an identity source. You cannot upgrade an FMC with user agent configurations to Version 6.7+. You should switch to Cisco Identity Services Engine/Passive Identity Connector (ISE/ISE-PIC). This will also allow you to take advantage of features that are not available with the user agent. To convert your license, contact Sales.
For more information, see the End-of-Life and End-of-Support for the Cisco Firepower User Agent announcement and the Firepower User Identity: Migrating from User Agent to Identity Services Engine TechNote.
Cisco Terminal Services (TS) Agent
Cisco TS Agent Versions 1.0 and 1.1 have been removed from the Cisco Support & Download site. If you are using either of these versions, we recommend you upgrade.
