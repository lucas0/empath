Overview
Cisco IOx provides uniform and consistent hosting capabilities for various types of apps across various Cisco platforms. This platform brings together Cisco IOS, the industry-leading networking operating system, and Linux, the leading open source platform. Linux-based applications can run on Cisco devices in the Cisco IOx framework, so using this platform, you can bring custom applications and interfaces to the network.
With Cisco IOx, developers can create a wide variety of IoT apps, such as data aggregation system and control systems.
New Features in This Release
New features in Cisco IOx Release 1.3.0 include the items that the following sections describe:
Developer Experience
IOx Services
USB Interfaces
Cisco Fog Director
Layer 2 Traffic and VLAN
Developer Experience
IOx automatically configures IOS NAT rules to provide northbound network access to application containers.
Platform configuration of application containers is simplified by using IOx Docker based software development environment.
IOx Services
The IOx services C SDK allows developers to create and publish IOx micro services, which can be readily consumed by multiple IOx applications via language agnostic Rest API or websockets. SDK is supported on IR8x9 platforms.
USB Interfaces
This release includes support for USB-Serial devices that allow IOx apps to access data from variety of sensors connected to a USB interface. This USB support is only applicable to IR8x9 platforms.
Cisco Fog Director
Fog Director can manage application life-cycle on 150,000 devices.
When you add or upgrade an app and upload an app package from a Docker image, you no longer need to specify a package.yaml app descriptor file. If you do not specify this file, Cisco Fog Director generates metadata from the Docker image automatically.
When installing or reconfiguring an app, Configure Resource Profile now includes the Allocate all available resources option, which assigns all CPU and memory resources that are available on each device on which you are installing, and the Custom profile option, which assigns on each device the CPU and memory resources that you specify.
When retrying a failed action for an app, the VIEW DEPLOY ACTION HISTORY button displays the Actions History window, which provides information about devices on which the action is in Outstanding state or Expired state.
The new Additional Actions button on the Devices View page provides access to new pages that let you rediscover, manage tags for, or delete multiple devices at once.
The new Device Filters field on the Devices View page lets you display devices that meet specified reachable, last heard, and discovery status criteria.
Layer 2 Traffic and VLAN
This release includes support of Layer 2 traffic and VLAN to IOx application containers.
