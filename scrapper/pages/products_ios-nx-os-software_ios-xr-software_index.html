Features and benefits
Simple
IOS XR7 helps simplify your network with a flexible, modular design that uses less memory, boots up faster, and can be loaded into a core or access-level device. A single operating system (OS) across the network will streamline the operational work for engineers, which frees them up to work on your revenue generating tasks.
Modern
Use your modern network OS to give control and power back to your engineers. Integrated streaming telemetry data increases network visibility and allows engineers to use Open APIs to build proactive policy responses to network events keeping clients happy. Engineers can also use the data to build better capacity exhaustion models giving them more control over CAPEX and OPEX budgets.
Trustworthy
IOS XR7 is an advanced network OS that can help improve network security. A tamper-resistant, self-check process begins before the CPU is allowed to boot and offers significant protections against compromises to the hardware and firmware. IOS XR7 guards against malicious actors and exploitation bugs through an advanced signing technology and multiple runtime defenses, including Integrated Measurement Architecture (IMA).
Sustainability
IOS XR7’s modularity and application hosting infrastructure allows customers to deploy on power efficient platforms and reduces the need for additional compute resources. Its programmability minimizes the need for operator intervention during set-up and operation, reducing onsite operations.
IOS XR Network OS supported platforms
IOS XR brings proven history, best-in-class routing protocols, and greater network control to routing platforms from the edge to the core.
