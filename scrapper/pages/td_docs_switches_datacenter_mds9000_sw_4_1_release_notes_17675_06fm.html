Introduction
The Cisco Fabric Manager provides an alternative to the command-line interface (CLI) for most switch configuration commands. Fabric Manager provides powerful Fibre Channel troubleshooting tools such as advanced monitoring features and sophisticated debug analysis tools. These in-depth health and configuration analysis capabilities leverage unique MDS 9000 switch capabilities including the Fibre Channel Ping and Traceroute utilities.
The Cisco Fabric Manager includes these management applications:
•Fabric Manager (client and server)
•Device Manager
•Performance Manager
•Fabric Manager Web Services
For detailed information on using Cisco Fabric Manager to configure a Cisco MDS 9000 Family switch, refer to the Cisco MDS 9000 Family Fabric Manager Configuration Guide. For information on using the CLI to configure a Cisco MDS 9000 Family switch, refer to the Cisco MDS 9000 Family CLI Configuration Guide or the Cisco MDS 9020 Switch Configuration Guide and Command Reference.
Version Compatibility
As the features and capabilities of Cisco Fabric Manager continue to evolve, it is important to be aware of the following software version compatibility information:
•Cisco Family Fabric Manager Release 4.1(3b) can manage switches that are running any MDS 9000 NX-OS 4.x release and switches that are running any SAN-OS 3.x release.
•Any Fabric Manager 3.x release cannot fully manage switches that are running any MDS 9000 NX-OS 4.x release because Fabric Manager Release 3.x cannot manage features that are specific to the MDS 9000 NX-OS 4.x release series. Fabric Manager Release 3.3(x) can manage all legacy features in any SAN-OS 3.x, 2.x, and 1.x release.
•In terms of testing and support, future releases of Cisco Fabric Manager 4.x will be backwards compatible with the two previous releases of MDS NX-OS 4.x and with the two highest releases in the SAN-OS 3.x release series.
•Fabric Manager Release 4.1(3b) offers backwards compatibility support for the releases shown in Table 1.
Table 1 Software Version Compatibility

Upgrading Your Version of Cisco Fabric Manager
As of Cisco SAN-OS Release 3.2(1), Cisco Fabric Manager is no longer packaged with a Cisco MDS 9000
Family switch. It is included on the CD-ROM that ships with the switch. You can install Fabric Manager from the CD-ROM or from files that you download.
Installing Cisco Fabric Manager is a multi-step process that involves installing a database, as well as Fabric Manager. The complete installation instructions are provided in the "Installation of Cisco MDS SAN-OS and Fabric Manager" section in the Cisco MDS 9000 Family Fabric Manager Configuration Guide, and are available on-screen once you launch the Fabric Manager installer from the CD-ROM.
Note When upgrading Fabric Manager, refer to the supported upgrade path shown in Table 2. For example, when upgrading from SAN-OS Release 3.1(x) to Release 4.1(3b), you will need to upgrade from Release 3.1(x) to Release 3.2(x) and then upgrade to Release 4.1(3b).

The Fabric Manager Installation Process Overview
The following section presents the flow of the installation process at a high level. Review these guidelines before you begin the installation process.
1. Verify supported software. Cisco Fabric Manager has been tested with the following software:
•Windows 2003 SP2, XP SP2, Windows Vista
•Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS Release 4 (Nahant Update 6)
•Solaris (SPARC) 8, 9, and 10
•VMWare ESX 3.5:
•Virtual Operating System: Windows 2003 SP2
•Java Sun JRE and JDK 1.5(x) and JRE 1.6(x) are supported
Note Do no use Java 1.6 Update 13.
•Java Web Start 1.2, 1.0.1, 1.5, 1.6
•Firefox 1.5 and 2.0
•Internet Explorer 6.x, and 7.0
•Oracle 11g Enterprise Edition
•Oracle 10g Enterprise Edition
•Oracle Database 10g Express
•PostgreSQL 8.2 (Windows and Linux)
•PostgreSQL 8.1 (Solaris)
•Cisco ACS 3.1 and 4.0
•PIX Firewall
•IP Tables
•SSH v2
•Global Enforce SNMP Privacy Encryption
•HTTPS
2. Ensure data migration when upgrading Cisco Fabric Manager from Cisco SAN-OS Releases 3.1(2b) and later.

If you are upgrading Cisco Fabric Manager in Cisco SAN-OS Releases 3.1(2b) and later, be aware that data is migrated from the Hypersonic HSQL database to either the PostgreSQL database or Oracle Database 10g Express during the installation. Data is also migrated from Oracle Database 10g Express to Oracle Database 10g Express. If you migrate the database from Oracle to Oracle, the schema is updated. Refer to Table 2 for information on the supported upgrade path.
3. Ensure data migration when upgrading Cisco Fabric Manager from releases prior to Cisco SAN-OS Releases 3.1(2b).

If you are upgrading Fabric Manager in a Cisco SAN-OS Release prior to 3.1(2b), be aware that data is migrated from the Hypersonic HSQL database to either the PostgreSQL database or the Oracle Database 10g Express during the installation. The Fabric Manager Installer installs the PostgreSQL database on Windows. If you want to install the PostgreSQL database on Solaris or Linux, or if you want to install the Oracle Database 10g Express database, follow the instructions in the "Installation of Cisco MDS SAN-OS and Fabric Manager" section in the Cisco MDS 9000 Family Fabric Manager Configuration Guide. Refer to Table 5 for information on the supported upgrade path.
4. If you are upgrading a previous installation of Fabric Manager, make sure the previous installation is installed and running. Do not uninstall the previous version. If the previous version is uninstalled, the database will not be migrated and your server settings will not be preserved.
5. Select the database.
If you want to use the Oracle Database 10g Express, you must install the database and create a user name and password before continuing with the Fabric Manager installation. We recommend the Oracle Database 10g Express option for all users who are running Performance Manager on large fabrics (1000 or more end devices).
If you want to install the PostgreSQL database, you must disable any security software you are running as PostgreSQL may not install certain folders or users. You must also log in as a Superuser before you start the installation.
6. Install Fabric Manager from the CD-ROM or from files that you download from Cisco.com at the following website:
http://cisco.com/cgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/mds-fm
Note From NX-OS Release 4.1(3a) and later, Fabric Manager Web Client and Device Manager are automatically installed during the Fabric Manager installation process. They are installed only on the host where the Fabric Manager Server is installed.

If you want to use Fabric Manager Web Client and Device Manager on a remote machine, use this procedure described in the "Downloading Cisco Device Manager" section to download Device Manager using Fabric Manager Web Client. Cisco recommends using the Fabric Manager Web Client on a different host than the Fabric Manager Server for increased scalability.
Installing Fabric Manager on Solaris
This section includes guidelines on installing Fabric Manager Server on Solaris from the Fabric Manager Installation CD.
•Turn off security software before installing PostGreSQL.
•If you are installing the Fabric Manager Server on a Solaris 9 host, to avoid memory allocation issues during the PostGreSQL installation process, make these changes to the system parameters file /etc/system. You may need to increase these values depending on what applications are installed on your host.
set shmsys:shminfo_shmmax=252993536
set shmsys:shminfo_shmmin=1
set shmsys:shminfo_shmmni=256 
set shmsys:shminfo_shmseg=256

set semsys:seminfo_semmap=256
set semsys:seminfo_semmni=512
set semsys:seminfo_semmns=512
set semsys:seminfo_semmsl=32

•Make sure a supported Java version is installed and that JavaScript is enabled in your browser.
•On Solaris 9, the supported web browser is Mozilla 1.7. You can download Mozilla from the following website: http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/browser/getmozilla17.xml.
•On Solaris 10, the supported web browser is FireFox 2.0. You can download FireFox from the following website: http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/.
•On Solaris 9, you may need to manually set the Java Web Start MIME type for .jnlp files. Follow these steps to make the required changes:
1. Open the Mozilla web browser.
2. Select Edit > Preferences > Navigator > Helper Applications.
3. Click New Type and then enter the following information to set the MIME type in the respective fields:
MIME Type: application/x-java-jnlp-file
Description: Java Web Start
Extension: jnlp
4. Choose Open these files using the default application under When a file of this type is encountered:, and then click OK.
After reviewing the guidelines listed in this section, follow these steps to install Fabric Manager on Solaris:
Step 1 Set Java 1.5 or 1.6 to the path that is to be used for installing Fabric Manager.
Step 2 Install the database that is to be used with Fabric Manager.
Step 3 Copy the Fabric Manager jar file m9000-fm-4.3.1b.jar from the CD-ROM to a folder on the Solaris workstation.
Step 4 Launch the installer using the following command:
java -Xms512m -Xmx512m -jar m9000-fm-4.3.1b.jar
Step 5 Follow the onscreen instructions provided in the Fabric Manager management software setup wizard.
Installing Fabric Manager on Windows
To install Fabric Manager on Windows, follow these steps:
Step 1 Click the Install Management Software link.
Step 2 Choose Management Software > Cisco Fabric Manager.
Step 3 Click the Installing Fabric Manager link.
Step 4 Select the drive for your CD-ROM.
Step 5 Click the FM Installer link.
Step 6 Follow the onscreen instructions provided in the Fabric Manager Installer 4.1(3b).
To install Device Manager on your workstation, follow these steps:
Step 1 Enter the IP address of the switch in the Address field of your browser.
Step 2 Click the Cisco Device Manager link in the Device Manager installation window.
Step 3 Click Next to begin the installation.
Step 4 Follow the onscreen instructions to complete the installation of Device Manager.
Note If you use a Java JDK instead of a JRE on Solaris, you might encounter a problem trying to install the Device Manager from a web browser. This can happen because the installer heap limit of 256 MB is not sufficient. If you have this problem, save the jnlp link as file, increase the heap limit to 512 MB, and run javaws element-manager.jnlp at the shell prompt.
