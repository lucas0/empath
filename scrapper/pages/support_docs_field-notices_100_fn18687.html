Note: All of the revision levels above use Firmware revision 0.3(8).
Problem Description
In a well installed system the amount of Data Communication Proprietary Protocol (QPP) traffic is low. In an inproper system installation (installed by not following the installation manual), the QPP communication links over the fibers can cause an abnormally high amount of message transfers which increase the possibility to any of the following issues. A possible indication of this behavior is the toggling of QPP alarms on the management interface.
CLIPs in the system do not appear, or appear intermittently, in the management system inventory.
Some CLIPs have wrong Network Element Identifier (NEID) register values.
Some CLIPs cannot carry traffic after power-up.
Background
Investigation shows the reason for problem (A) is a massive amount of traffic on the internal communication network (DCN). The main reason for the traffic is a number of bouncing messages between CLIPs. A bouncing message is created when the destination or source address in a message gets corrupted and there is a CLIP inserted in the slot of the corrupted address (heavy traffic load on the CAN and QPP busses, caused by toggling QPP alarms, is the likely cause of the corrupted CAN packet destination address).
Analysis of problem A
A timing problem has been found in the interface between the FPGA and the CAN driver device on the CLIP. A corrupted destination or source field may cause bouncing messages.
Analysis of problem B
The timing problem can also cause a corrupted message payload. There is a possibility that this can lead to the modification of register values.
Analysis of problem C
This problem is related to an occasional glitch which has been found on a signal in the interface between the FPGA and the serial EEPROM device, where the calibration data is stored. The glitch may cause a write operation to fail. The next time this CLIP is power cycled, it will fail during initialization and the lasers will not be turned on. Because of the retransmissions and timeouts mentioned earlier, there will be an abnormal amount of write operations to the CLIPs in the system.
Problem Symptoms
CLIPs in the system do not appear, or appear intermittently, in the management system inventory.
Some CLIPs have wrong NEID register values. Further analysis of the memory dumps of these boards shows that also other register values are modified. If multiple CLIPs obtain identical (corrupted) NEIDs, the management system will logically OR all of the information and display it as one CLIP.
Some CLIPs cannot carry traffic after power-up.
Workaround/Solution
Solution
Problem (A) is not traffic affecting. Reseating the CIM board resolves the problem on the (electrical) CAN bus in the MCU. This will clear all CAN bus traffic (including bouncing messages) within the MCU. If the problem resides on the optical layer, an upgrade to the new Firmware 1.2(2) is required to clear bouncing QPP messages on the optical layer, such as QPP traffic between MCU-SCU and SCU-SCU.
Problem (B) is not traffic affecting and can be resolved by upgrading to the new Firmware 1.2(2).
Problem (C) can be resolved by a Firmware upgrade from the current Firmware version 0.3(8) to the new 1.2(2) version.
Recommendations
If the system is operating under normal conditions (installation in accordance with the installation manual, and a low rate of management traffic), no immediate action is required.
In case any of the problems mentionned are seen on the network, upgrade the CLIPs. An increased number of QPP and CAN Alarms raised is an indication of the system degradation.
Mixing old 0.3(8) and new 1.2(2) Firmware
Mixing of firmware is allowed and compatible under the following circumstances.
All hub to hub configurations
Mixing Clips in an MCU (Electrical CAN bus)
Mixing Clips in one optical Channel (Optical CAN bus)
Old 0.3(8) and new 1.2(2) Firmware are compatible with each other if not used in the configuration detailed below.
If a CLIP board with FW 0.3(8) is located in a site where there is a NCB-board (Site 1), CLIP boards on the remote CAN-bus (Site 2) must not be equipped with FW 1.2(2) in order to have management visibility of the CLIPs reached through the remote CAN-bus (Site 3) with QPP.
