Create Configuration Group Workflow for a Single-Router Site
This feature introduces the Create Configuration Group workflow. The simplified workflow consolidates the various settings pages into a single page so that you can easily review your configuration at once. It also enables you to set up the WAN and LAN routing, in addition to the basic settings, at the time of creating a configuration group. As a result, any configuration created from the workflow is now immediately deployable.
Network Hierarchy and Resource Management
This feature enables you to create a network hierarchy in Cisco vManage to represent the geographical locations of your network. The network hierarchy and the associated resource IDs, including region IDs and site IDs, help you apply configuration settings to a device. In addition, the introduction of the resource manager in Cisco vManage automatically manages these resource IDs, thereby simplifying the overall user experience of Cisco SD-WAN.
You can create a region only if you enable the Multi-Region Fabric option in Cisco vManage.
Wireless Management on Cisco 1000 Series Integrated Services Routers supporting WIFI6 WLAN module
This feature enables you to configure the wireless LAN settings on WiFi6-capable Cisco 1000 Series Integrated Services Routers using Cisco vManage.
The Embedded Wireless Controller on Cisco 1000 Series Integrated Services Routers helps you provide wireless connectivity without the need for another external controller to configure and manage the wireless settings on the routers using Cisco vManage.
Co-Management: Improved Granular Configuration Task Permissions
To provide a user with the ability to self-manage specific configuration tasks, you can assign the user permissions to configure specific features while excluding others. This feature introduces numerous new permission options, enabling fine granularity in determining which configuration task permissions to provide to a user.
RBAC for Security Operations and Network Operations Default User Groups
This feature provides the following default user groups:
network_operations user group for non-security policies
security_operations user group for security policies
RBAC for policies allows you to create users and user groups with the required read and write permissions for security and non-security policies. Users can perform configuration and monitoring actions only for the authorized policy type.
Flexible Tenant Placement on Multitenant Cisco vSmart Controllers
With this feature, while onboarding a tenant to a multitenant deployment, you can choose the pair of multitenant Cisco vSmart Controllers that serve the tenant. After onboarding a tenant, you can migrate the tenant to a different pair of multitenant Cisco vSmart Controllers to allow for more tenant WAN edge devices than was forecast during onboarding.
Cisco SD-WAN Routing
Route Leaking between Inter-Service VPN
This feature allows you to leak routes between service VPNs on the same edge device.
Route leaking feature allows redistribution of replicated routes between the inter-service VPN for Connected, Static, BGP, OSPF, and EIGRP protocols on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
Cisco SD-WAN Policies
Prioritized Color Preference
This feature adds support for ranking of Application Aware Routing (AAR) preferred and backup preferred colors. You can configure up to three levels of priority based on the color or path preference on a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device.
Application-Aware Routing for IPv6
This feature enables you to configure application-aware routing (AAR) policies to operate with IPv6 application traffic.
Flexible NetFlow Export Spreading
This feature enables export spreading to prevent export storms that occur when a burst of packets are sent to external collector. The export of the previous interval is spread during the current interval to prevent export storms. When Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) or netflow packets are sent over a low-bandwidth circuit, the export spreading functionality is enabled to avoid packet drops.
Support for Cisco SD-WAN Policy Configuration Tagging Using the Cisco vSmart Controller CLI Template
This feature allows you to group multiple policy objects under a tag. The tag mechanism when used in Cisco SD-WAN centralized or localized policies:
Controls the policy configuration download speed between the Cisco vSmart Controller and the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
Improves management of the defined lists in the Cisco vSmart Controller.
Better organizes the configurations of the intent-based network.
Lawful Intercept
This feature enhances the support for Lawful Intercept in Cisco SD-WAN.
Cisco SD-WAN's Lawful Intercept feature enables Cisco vManage and Cisco vSmart controller to provide the key information to LEA so they can decrypt the Cisco SD-WAN IPsec traffic captured by the MSP.
Cisco SD-WAN Security
Cisco SD-WAN Identity-Based Firewall Policy
This feature allows you to configure user-identity-based firewall policies for unified security policies.
Cisco Identity Services Engine and Microsoft Active Directory Services are identity providers to authenticate and authorize device users in the network. When Cisco vManage and a Cisco vSmart controller establish a connection to the Cisco Identity Services Engine, information about user and user groups—that is, identity-mapping information—is retrieved from the Cisco Identity Services Engine. Identity-based policies are then distributed to Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. This identity mapping information is used while creating firewall policies.
Automatic GRE Tunnels to Zscaler
With this feature, use the Secure Internet Gateway (SIG) feature template to provision automatic GRE tunnels to Zscaler SIGs. In earlier releases, the SIG template only supported the provisioning of automatic IPSec tunnels to Zscaler SIGs.
Global SIG Credentials Template
With this feature, create a single global Cisco SIG Credentials template for each SIG provider (Cisco Umbrella or Zscaler). When you attach a Cisco SIG template to a device template, Cisco vManage automatically attaches the applicable global Cisco SIG Credentials template to the device template.
Monitor Automatic SIG Tunnel Status and Events
Monitor security events related to automatic SIG tunnels using the Security Events pane on the Monitor > Security page, and the Events dashboard on the Monitor > Logs page.
Monitor automatic SIG tunnel status using the SIG Tunnel Status pane on the Monitor > Security page, and the SIG Tunnels dashboard on the Monitor > Tunnels page.

With this feature, Cisco vManage operates together with Megaport and enables you to monitor your licenses while Cisco and Megaport jointly enforce the license requirements when you create Interconnect Gateways or Interconnect Connections.
Decoupled Site-to-Site and Site-to-Cloud Connectivity Configuration for Cloud Gateways
With this feature, you can configure some cloud gateways to support site-to-site and site-to-cloud connectivity, and other cloud gateways to support only site-to-cloud connectivity. This configuration flexibility is particularly beneficial in some Google Cloud regions that do not yet support site-to-site connectivity.
In earlier releases, connectivity type is a global configuration. You configure all the cloud gateways to support site-to-site and site-to-cloud connectivity, or to support only site-to-cloud connectivity.
Horizontal Scaling of Cisco Catalyst 8000V Instances in a Cloud Gateway
With this feature, you can deploy between two and eight Cisco Catalyst 8000V instances as part of a cloud gateway in a particular region.
In earlier releases, you can deploy only two Cisco Catalyst 8000V instances as part of a cloud gateway, with each instance deployed in a different zone of a region.
Cisco SD-WAN AppQoE
HTTP Connect
Starting from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.9.1a, the HTTP Connect method handling is supported in AppQoE that enables services like SSL Proxy and DRE to optimize the HTTP Connect encrypted traffic.
Cisco SD-WAN Monitor and Maintain

The Config Diff option is available for audit logs to view the configuration changes when a template is not attached to a device.
Schedule the Software Upgrade Workflow
This feature introduces an option to schedule software upgrades for edge devices using Cisco vManage.
Software Upgrade Workflow Support for Additional Platforms
Added support for Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) and Cisco Catalyst Cellular Gateways.
Cisco SD-WAN NAT
Support for PPP Dialer Interfaces with NAT DIA
This feature adds support for the following Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) dialer interfaces: PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE), PPP over Asynchronous Transfer Mode (PPPoA), and PPP over Ethernet Asynchronous Transfer Mode (PPPoEoA).
You can use the PPP dialer interfaces to access IPv4 services and sites.
Support for Static NAT Mapping with HSRP
With this feature, if both the Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) routers are configured with the same static NAT mapping, only the active device responds to the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) request for a static NAT mapping entry. Traffic that fails over from the HSRP active device to the standby device does not have to wait for the ARP request to time out before failing over.
ALG Support for NAT DIA and Zone-Based Firewalls
This feature provides support for an application-level gateway (ALG) that translates the IP address inside the payload of an application packet. Specific protocols such as Domain Name System (DNS), FTP, and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) require a NAT ALG for translation of the IP addresses and port numbers in the packet payload.
Support for Port Forwarding with NAT DIA
With this feature, you can define one or more port-forwarding rules to send packets received on a particular port from an external network to reach devices on an internal network.
Prior to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.9.1a and Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1, port forwarding was available for service-side NAT only.
Support for NAT High-Speed Logging
This feature provides the ability to enable or disable high-speed logging (HSL) of all translations by NAT.
The new ip nat log translations flow-export command is introduced.
You can configure NAT HSL using a device CLI or a CLI add-on template.
Cisco SD-WAN Multi-Region Fabric (also Hierarchical SD-WAN)
Re-Origination Dampening
In networks experiencing instability, TLOCs and bidirectional forwarding detection (BFD) tunnels may cycle repeatedly between being available and unavailable. This causes the overlay management protocol (OMP) to repeatedly withdraw and re-originate routes. This churn adversely affects Cisco vSmart controller performance.
Adding a delay before re-originating routes that have gone down repeatedly prevents excessive churn, and prevents this type of network instability from diminishing Cisco vSmart controller performance.
Migrating to Multi-Region Fabric
Cisco SD-WAN Multi-Region Fabric provides a migration mode to facilitate migrating an enterprise network to Cisco SD-WAN. Migration mode enables a stepwise transition of devices from Cisco vSmart controllers that are not part of a Multi-Region Fabric network to Cisco vSmart controllers operating in a Multi-Region Fabric architecture.
The migration mode is useful for migrating complex networks that function similarly to a Multi-Region Fabric architecture—that is, they have multiple network segments, and have a control policy that directs inter-segmental traffic through network hubs.
Match Traffic by Destination Region
When creating an application route policy or data policy, you can match traffic according to its destination region. The destination may be a device in the same primary region, the same secondary region, or neither of these.
Specify Path Type Preference
When configuring a centralized policy, you can create a preferred color group list, which specifies three levels of route preference, called primary, secondary and tertiary. The route preferences are based on TLOC color and, optionally, on the path type—direct tunnel, multi-hop path, or all paths. Path type is relevant to networks using Multi-Region Fabric.
High Availability
Configure Disaster Recovery Alerts
This feature provides support for configuring Cisco vManage alerts to generate an alarm and a syslog message for any disaster recovery workflow failure or event that occurs.
