* vCPU, RAM, and Storage Size numbers are on per Cisco vManage basis. The Storage Size numbers are the maximum tested values by Cisco, you can allocate smaller storage sizes.
** For a larger dataset per day, have Stats running on all servers.
To achieve scale beyond the above mentioned numbers, deploy multiple overlays.
