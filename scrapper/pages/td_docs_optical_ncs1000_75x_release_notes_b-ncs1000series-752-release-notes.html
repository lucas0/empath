What's New in Cisco NCS 1000 Series, IOS XR Release 7.5.2
NCS 1004
Feature Description
Alarms
Health check to report any crash in LCAPP
The new LC-DISCONNECTED alarm is raised in IOS XR if the Line Card Application (LCAPP) crashes or restarts. At the same time, older core files are deleted while retaining only the most recent ones to free up memory space. This enhancement speeds up the fault notification process and reduces LCAPP downtime.
System Setup and Software Installation
FPD Upgrade Support for SSDs
The FPDs of two SSDs on the chassis and on the route processor can be upgraded. This feature allows you to maintain the FPD versions of SSDs with latest firmware included with enhancements and bug fixes. If an FPD upgrade is due, the One Or More FPDs Need Upgrade Or Not In Current State alarm is raised on the route processor.
Health Check for Proper Backup ISO Image
This feature primitively validates the backup ISO image to be used during Disaster Recovery. The validation happens before copying the image to the CPU disk and motherboard disks, and thereafter the copied image is audited every 12 hours. Image corruption triggers the Disaster recovery is disabled due to corrupted ISO alarm. This Health Check feature ensures error-free booting of NCS 1004 chassis during disaster recovery operations.
Data Models
OC Support for 10G Grey Mux
You can now configure a 10x10G muxponder on each slice of the OTN-XP line card. The 10x10G muxponder multiplexes ten 10G clients and map it to a grey OTU4 trunk signal. This feature improves efficiency, performance, and flexibility for customer networks allowing 10x10G client transport over 100G WDM wavelength.
OpenROADM
100G TXP Configurations
It is now possible to configure 100G data rates for a TXP interface on the OTN-XPL line card. This configuration allows the signal to travel longer distances before a need for regeneration.
16 QAM Modulation Format for 200G MXP Interfaces
200G MXP interfaces on the OTN-XPL line card now support the 16 QAM modulation format. This format uses a lower baud rate. As a result, it permits the use of a smaller channel spacing of 50GHz.
Bookended Configuration for 400G Trunk Rates
Bookended configurations are Cisco proprietary configurations where the same network element is present on the near and far end nodes. Bookended configurations are supported for 400G trunk rates on the OTN-XPL line card, resulting in better optical reach than the standard configuration.
REGEN Configurations for 200G and 400G Interfaces
3R regeneration improves optical signal quality by reamplifying, reshaping, and retiming the data pulses. The 200G and 400G interfaces on the OTN-XPL line card now support REGEN configurations. This functionality overcomes the effects of optical signal degradation during long-haul optical transmission.
Support for QSFP-100G-FR-S and QSFP-100G-LR-S pluggables for Open ROADM configurations
You can now control and manage the QSFP-100G-FR-S and QSFP-100G-LR-S pluggable modules installed on the OTN-XPL line card using an Open ROADM-compliant controller. This functionality extends the programmability benefits of the Open ROADM controller to configure these pluggable modules at scale.
Untimed Granularity Ethernet PMs
Untimed granularity PMs are PMs that are collected continuously till the interface is deprovisioned and are used for performance monitoring. The following untimed ethernet PMs are supported on the OTN-XPL line card:
100G: codeViolations, inFramesErrored, outFrames, inFrames, fecCorrectedCodewords, fecUncorrectedCodewords
400G: fecCorrectedCodewords, fecUncorrectedCodewords
Hardware
Pluggables Support
The following pluggables are supported:
QSFP-100G-LR-S
DP04CFP2-M25-K9
Configuration
DAC Configuration Support for 400GE, 4x100G, or 400G Regen modes
On the OTN-XP card, you can configure the Digital-to-Analog (DAC) rate for the 400GE, 4x100G, or 400G Regen modes with CFP2 DCO pluggable. Based on the DAC rate configured, pulse shaping and modem setting is set on the CFP2 DCO trunk pluggable.
FC-MXP Mode Support on the OTN-XP Card
The OTN-XP card now supports FC-MXP LC mode for Fiber Channel (FC) support. You can configure 16G FC with 400G trunk rate.
Idle Insertion for Ethernet Controllers
Idle insertion for Ethernet controllers feature performs end-to-end link verification between 100GE or 400GE Ethernet controllers before bringing up the actual traffic. This feature enables you to perform pre-provisioning checks to isolate link errors in advance without any Ethernet testers. This feature is supported on the 1.2T C band, 1.2T L band, and 800G QSFP-DD Transponder line cards.
Regeneration Mode support on the OTN-XP Card
The OTN-XP card now supports the OTUCn-REGEN LC mode for regeneration. This mode allows regeneration of the DWDM channels across trunk ports of the OTN-XP card and significantly extends the reach of the service. You can configure 200G and 400G trunk rates on the card.
Split Client Port Mapping
A new trunk port to client port mapping for sub 50G configurations is now available on the 1.2T C band, 1.2T L band, and 800G QSFP-DD Transponder line cards. In this mapping, the same shared client port is used for all Sub 50G trunk data rates, eliminating recabling while changing the data rates.
NCS 1001
There are no new features introduced in this release.
