    Globally, the total number of internet users is projected to grow from 3.9 billion in 2018 to 5.3 billion by 2023. By 2023, the consumer share of total devices, including both fixed and mobile devices, will be 74 percent. Video devices in particular can have a multiplier effect on traffic. Content providers will need to scale their networks at speed to keep up with the demand for more video. Networks needs to be designed with “web scale” in mind. A web-scale network needs to scale at deployment speed while being operationally simple. Cisco® Network Convergence System (NCS) 1004 uses state-of-the-art silicon along with complete automation and real-time visibility to deliver a universal transponder solution that provides best-in-class performance for metro, long-haul, and submarine applications while being simple to deploy and manage.
Product features and benefits
The NCS 1004 800G QSFP-DD transponder can provide up to 8xQSFP slots, out of which 6 can host QSFP-28 and 2 can host QSFP-DD/QSFP-28/ZR/ZR+ client ports. The client ports map to two trunk ports operating any rate between 100G and 400G in 50G increments. The baud rate, modulation format, and FEC of each trunk port is software configurable per slice, where each slice is a combination of a sequence of 4 client ports.
The trunk ports are capable of several line rates with fine control of modulation format, baud rate, and forward error correction, allowing the solution to be used for metro, terrestrial long-haul, or submarine applications:
●      The baud rate can be controlled between 24 Gbd/s and 72 Gbd/s.
●      The modulation format can be controlled between QPSK, 8-QAM, 16QAM, 32QAM, and 64QAM.
●      Hybrids between modulation formats can be configured to achieve 0.001 bits/symbol of granularity.
●      Forward Error Correction (FEC) of 27% and 15% overhead.
●      Trunk line rate from 50G to 400G in 50G increments.

Cisco NCS 1004 800G QSFP-DD line card
The Cisco NCS 1004 system provides the following hardware benefits:
●      Transport of any trunk rate between 100- and 400-Gbps wavelengths on the same platform through software provisioning.
●      Support of granular control of baud rate and modulation format to maximize spectral efficiency.
●      One universal transponder that is performance optimized for metro, long-haul, and submarine applications.
●      Support for up to 350,000 ps/nm of residual chromatic dispersion compensation.
●      Transport of 100GE, OTU4, and 400GE on the same platform through software provisioning.
●      400G DWDM provides unparalleled scale and density. With 64 channels of 400G at 75 GHz, the NCS 1004 provides 25.6 Tbps in 16RU, and with 96 channels of 400G at 50 GHz, the NCS 1004 provides 38.4 Tbps.
●      Nonlinear compensation for maximum performance on compensated legacy subsea cables and for nonlinear terrestrial fibers.
●      SOP tracking speed of up to 10 million rad/s for aerial fiber applications.
Modulation schemes
The Cisco NCS 1004 1.2T transponder features a software-configurable modulation scheme per slice, allowing the operator to customize the spectral efficiency and reach characteristics of individual wavelengths. Supported modulation formats are detailed in Table 1.

Wavelength tunability
The line interface supports software-provision able tunability across the full C band, covering 96 channels across 191.25 to 196.10 THz (1528.77 to 1566.72 nm). Grid-less tuning support allows for continuous tunability in increments of 0.1 GHz and the ability to create multicarrier super-channels over flex spectrum line systems.
Protocol transparency
The Cisco NCS 1004 800G transponder can transparently deliver 100 GbE and OTU4 clients over 2x100G-400G DWDM and deliver 400GE clients over 2x400G, 2x200G DWDM.
Fine control of coherent DWDM interface
The Cisco NCS 1004 800G transponder provides the ability to modify baud rate and modulation format with fine control to meet capacity and reach requirements for a range of use cases.
●      Use 69-Gbaud/s line rates to maximize capacity at lowest price per bit for metro and long-haul networks.
●      Use real-time network bandwidth and performance data to maximize line rate capacity on a coherent DWDM interface.
●      Support line rates that can maximize capacity for bandwidth-constrained 50-GHz and 100-GHz spaced legacy ROADM networks.
●      Maximize spectral efficiency on a submarine cable line system for the target Q-margin.
Management
The Cisco NCS 1004 800G line card supports all management features as mentioned in the NCS 1004 system data sheet.
Performance monitoring
The Cisco NCS 1004 800G line card supports performance monitoring of optical parameters on the client and DWDM line interface, including laser bias current, transmit, and receive optical power. Ethernet RMON statistics for the client ports and OTN error counters for the trunk are also available. Calculation and accumulation of the performance-monitoring data are supported in 15-minute and 24-hour intervals as per G.7710. Physical system parameters measured at the wavelength level, such as mean polarization mode dispersion, accumulated chromatic dispersion, pre-FEC bit error rate, and received Optical Signal-To-Noise Ratio (OSNR), are also included in the set of performance-monitoring parameters. These parameters can greatly simplify troubleshooting operations.
