Defect Information

Defect ID Headline
CSCvw36279 N9500 fan flow direction reversed

Problem Description

The direction of airflow for some fan trays listed in this notice is incorrect.

Background

The Nexus 9500 Series supports front-to-back airflow (port side intake). The fans in a small batch of fan trays were installed incorrectly, which causes the airflow to change direction.
The show environment fan command output will show front-to-back, however the actual flow might be back-to-front.

Problem Symptom

The direction of airflow for some fan trays listed in this notice is incorrect.

Workaround/Solution

Cisco recommends that the affected Nexus 9508/9516 fan trays be replaced. Use the link in the Upgrade Program section to request the replacement parts.
