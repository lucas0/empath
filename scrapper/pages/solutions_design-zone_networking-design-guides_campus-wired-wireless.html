SD-Access Design Cisco Software-Defined Access Design Guide In this guide, you will learn deployment models, approaches and considerations along with recommended design practices for SD-Access fabric sites ranging from very small to very large in size that can be single independent sites or part of a larger, multi-site deployment.
SD-Access Design Cisco Software-Defined Access Segmentation Design Guide In this design guide, you will find background information around the need for segmentation in today’s networks to reduce the network attack surface. This document briefly looks at the history of segmentation and provides guidance around the use of macro-segmentation (VRFs/VNs) and/or micro-segmentation (SGTs) and how to determine which strategy is most applicable in different scenarios. Through several simple use cases in verticals such as education, healthcare, retail, manufacturing, and utilities, the reader will see how a combination of micro and macro-segmentation can be implemented to group network devices while minimizing the attack surface.
SD-Access Deployment Cisco DNA Center & ISE Management Infrastructure Deployment Guide In this guide, you will learn how to install and bootstrap the management infrastructure for the Cisco Digital Network Architecture which includes Cisco DNA Center and ISE.
Non-Fab Deployment Catalyst 9800 Non-Fabric Deployment using Cisco DNA Center Deployment Guide In this guide, you will learn how to deploy a wireless local area network (WLAN) within a campus network, using Catalyst 9800 Series WLAN controllers (WLCs) with access points (APs) in centralized (local mode) operation, using Cisco DNA Center
Non-Fab Deployment Catalyst 9800 Non-Fabric FlexConnect Deployment using Cisco DNA Center This guide focuses on how to deploy a wireless local area network (WLAN) within a branch network, using Catalyst 9800 Series WLAN controllers (WLCs) with access points (APs) in FlexConnect mode operation, using Cisco DNA Center.
Non-Fab Deployment Network Device Onboarding Using Cisco DNA Center Deployment Guide In this guide, you will learn how to automate Day-0 on-boarding of a single switch at branch/campus with Cisco DNA Center to reduce the overall cost and time by leveraging built-in PnP functionality and an on-boarding template.
Non-Fab Deployment Campus Software Image Management Using Cisco DNA Center Deployment Guide In this guide, you will learn how to leverage Cisco DNA Center to manage software images according to image type and version. You can view, import, and delete software images in the repository as well as standardize images per device family type by marking them as golden. The software images can then be pushed to target devices in your network for day 0-N use cases.
Non-Fab Deployment Enabling Cisco DNA Assurance on Existing Network Deployment Guide In this guide, you will learn how to leverage Cisco DNA Center to deploy Assurance in an existing brownfield network. This document covers both network and clients assurance.
Non-Fab Deployment Cisco DNA Application Assurance Deployment Guide In this guide, you will learn how to deploy Cisco DNA Application Assurance within an enterprise network; and how to monitor and troubleshoot applications and their performance when the application traffic crosses the WAN, through Cisco DNA Application Assurance.
SD-Access Deployment Software-Defined Access Medium and Large Site Fabric Provisioning Deployment Guide In this guide you will learn how to deploy medium and large fabric sites consisting of a multi-tier Hierarchical network model with dedicated shared services block and physical WLCs.
SD-Access Deployment Software-Defined Access for Distributed Campus Deployment Guide This guide will show you how to deploy unified and consistent policy across a metro area SD-Access deployment consisting of multiple, independent fabric sites. Both IP-based transits with fusion routers and SDA transits are discussed and deployed along with methods to provide Internet access to the deployment. Finally, important considerations and recommended practices for the deployment of the key architecture component–transit control plane nodes–are discussed and deployed.  
SD-Access Deployment Software-Defined Access Macro Segmentation Deployment Guide This guide is intended to provide technical guidance to design, deploy and operate Macro Segmentation across Software-Defined Access Fabric. It focuses on the steps to enable device level Segmentation across the SD-Access Fabric and Fusion device configuration to handle communication between separate VN’s or VRF or from VN/VRF to Shared services residing at the Data Center.
ETA Design Encrypted Traffic Analytics Design Guide In this guide, you will read about Encrypted Threat Analytics (ETA) design considerations for deploying this technology in either Cisco SD-Access fabrics or in traditional campus LANs or WANs. This document looks in depth at where and how to deploy this technology in conjunction with Flexible NetFlow on your network infrastructure to obtain the best results.
ETA Deployment Encrypted Traffic Analytics Non-Fabric Deployment Guide This document provides guidance on deploying ETA and NaaS configuration to routers and switches without the assistance of Cisco DNA Center in a Non-Fabric environment.
ETA Deployment Encrypted Traffic Analytics in Cisco SD-Access Fabrics Deployment Guide In this guide, you will learn how to configure ETA using Cisco DNA Center’s SSA application which allows for simple and automated deployment in a SD-Access Fabric.
Non-Fab Design Campus LAN and Wireless LAN Design Guide In this guide, you will learn how to design Campus LAN and Wireless LAN for High-density, Medium-Density and Small Site campuses. Design fundamentals for each layer in a campus (Access, Distribution and Core) for wired are discussed along with best practices. Campus WLAN design fundamentals such as controllers, deployment models and key features are discussed along with a best practices check list. In addition, management, ISE and QoS guidance is given.
Non-Fab Deployment Campus LAN L2 Access with Simplified Distribution Deployment Guide In this guide, guidance is given around Layer 2 Access layer wiring closets of varying port sizes along with platform configurations for this layer. Simplified Layer 2 distribution layer deployment guidance along with platform configurations are discussed.
