Introduction
This document describes how to configure Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) 2.3 integration with Facebook credentials for authenticated guest access.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:
Identity Services Engine (ISE) configuration
Basic Facebook App configuration
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
Cisco ISE Version 2.3
Facebook Social Login
Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Version 8.3.102.0
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.

Configuration
The Facebook app configuration presented is an example and not a Cisco recommended configuration.
1. Configure Facebook App
Go to https://developers.facebook.com, and register the new App.
The dashboard of the application shows App ID and App Secret key, which will be used on ISE to create the External Social login.
Make the created app public.
2. Integrate ISE with the Facebook app
Use the information mentioned below in order to integrate the Facebook App with Cisco ISE.
Navigate to Administration > Identity Management > External Identity Sources > Social Login and add new store.
Configure the ISE Guest Portal to Allow social login.
After configuring the ISE Guest Portal to allow social login, the social login will be populated with URLs and needs to be added to the Facebook App settings, Valid OAuth redirect URLs.
Add Facebook Login from Products and add Valid OAuth redirect URLs.
URLs will be automatically generated on ISE after successfully binding the ISE Portal with Facebook External Social login.
3. Configure Authentication and Authorization policies
The ISE Configuration follows the same configuration steps as Guest CWA (Central Web Authentication).
(For configuration steps on ISE CWA please refer to document below:
  https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/identity-services-engine/115732-central-web-auth-00.html )
Make sure that the Facebook ip address range (31.13.0.0/16) is excluded from the WLC redirect ACL
Verify
Once the guest user is redirected they are presented with the Log in With Facebook option.
This button takes advantage of the newly created application and redirects to the facebook login page where the user will enter their facebook credentials.
After successful authentication, the guest user redirects back to the ISE Portal.

Debugs on ISE
In order to enable debugs on ISE, navigate to Administration > System > Logging > Debug Log Configuration, select the PSN node and change the log level of the following components to DEBUG:
Logs to be checked - ise-psc.log and guest.log. You can tail them directly from CLI of ISE:
ise23-1/admin# show logging application ise-psc.log tail
During the connection to the Facebook App, ISE shows connection timed out error:
2017-08-21 08:28:18,003 DEBUG  [admin-http-pool22][] com.cisco.cpm.oauth.OAuthClient -::::- Got error while checking OAuth settings  for AppId: [123456789] and secret key: ****
2017-08-21 08:28:18,003 ERROR  [admin-http-pool22][] admin.restui.features.social.SocialLoginUIApi -::::- ERROR
connect timed out
Make sure the ISE Node has a direct internet connection.
