“We were using Zoom as our collaboration solution and it was taking three to five minutes to start every meeting. The doctors were frustrated. We were wasting their time. If we're in a meeting for an extra five minutes that's one patient we've lost for the day. So we switched to Webex. Webex is just a much simpler experience.”
