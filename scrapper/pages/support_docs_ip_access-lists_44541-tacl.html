Introduction
This document presents guidelines and recommended deployment techniques for filtering transit and edge traffic at your network ingress points. Transit access control lists (ACLs) are used to increase network security by explicitly permitting only required traffic into your network or networks.
Transit Filters
Typical Setup
In most edge network environments, such as a typical enterprise network Internet point of presence, ingress filtering should be used to drop unauthorized traffic at the edge of the network. In certain service provider deployments, this form of edge or transit traffic filtering can also be used effectively to limit the flow of transit traffic to and from customers to specific permitted protocols only. This document focuses on an enterprise deployment model.
This example depicts a typical enterprise Internet connectivity design. Two edge routers, IR1 and IR2, provide direct connectivity to the Internet. Behind these two routers, a pair of firewalls (Cisco PIXes in this example) provides stateful inspection capabilities and access to both the internal network and the demilitarized zone (DMZ). The DMZ contains public-facing services such as DNS and web; this is the only network accessible directly from the public Internet. The internal network should never be accessed directly by the Internet, but traffic sourced from the internal network must be able to reach Internet sites.
The edge routers should be configured to provide a first level of security through the use of inbound ACLs. The ACLs allow only specifically permitted traffic to the DMZ and allow return traffic for internal users accessing the Internet. All nonauthorized traffic should be dropped on the ingress interfaces.
Transit ACL Sections
In general, a transit ACL is composed of four sections.
Special-use address and anti-spoofing entries that deny illegitimate sources and packets with source addresses that belong within your network from entering the network from an external source
Note: RFC 1918 defines reserved address space that is not a valid source address on the Internet. RFC 3330 defines special-use addresses that might require filtering. RFC 2827 provides anti-spoofing guidelines.
Explicitly permitted return traffic for internal connections to the Internet
Explicitly permitted externally sourced traffic destined to protected internal addresses
Explicit deny statement
Note: Although all ACLs contain an implicit deny statement, Cisco recommends use of an explicit deny statement, for example, deny ip any any. On most platforms, such statements maintain a count of the number of denied packets that can be displayed using the show access-list command.
How to Develop a Transit ACL
The first step in the development of a transit ACL is to determine the protocols required within your networks. Although every site has specific requirements, certain protocols and applications are widely used and are most often permitted. For instance, if the DMZ segment provides connectivity for a publicly accessible web server, TCP from the Internet to the DMZ server address(es) on port 80 is required. Similarly, internal connections to the Internet require that the ACL permit return established TCP traffic â€“ traffic that has the acknowledgment (ACK) bit set.
Identify Required Protocols
The development of this list of required protocols can be a daunting task, but there are several techniques that can be used, as needed, in order to help identify required traffic.
Review your local security policy / service policy.
Your local site policy should help provide a baseline of permitted and denied services.
Review/audit your firewall configuration.
The current firewall configuration should contain explicit permit statements for allowed services. In many cases, you can translate this configuration to ACL format and use it to create the bulk of the ACL entries.
Note: Stateful firewalls typically do not have explicit rules for return traffic to authorized connections. Since router ACLs are not stateful, the return traffic must be explicitly allowed.
Review/audit your applications.
The applications hosted on the DMZ and those used internally can help determine filtering requirements. Review the application requirements in order to provide essential details about the filtering design.
Use a classification ACL.
A classification ACL is composed of permit statements for the various protocols that could be destined to the internal network. (See Appendix A for a list of commonly used protocols and applications.) Use the show access-list command to display a count of access control entry (ACE) hits to identify required protocols. Investigate and understand any suspicious or surprising results before you create explicit permit statements for unexpected protocols.
Use the Netflow switching feature.
Netflow is a switching feature that, if enabled, provides detailed flow information. If Netflow is enabled on your edge routers, the show ip cache flow command gives a list of protocols logged by Netflow. Netflow cannot identify all protocols, so this technique must be used in conjunction with others.
Identify Invalid Traffic
In addition to direct protection, the transit ACL should also provide a first line of defense against certain types of invalid traffic on the Internet.
Deny RFC 1918 space.
Deny packets with a source address that falls under special-use address space, as defined in RFC 3330.
Apply anti-spoof filters, in accordance with RFC 2827; your address space should never be the source of packets from outside your autonomous system (AS).
Other types of traffic to consider include:
External protocols and IP Addresses that need to communicate with the edge router
ICMP from service provider IP Addresses
Routing protocols
IPSec VPN, if an edge router is used as the termination
Explicitly permitted return traffic for internal connections to the Internet
Specific Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) types
Outbound Domain Name System (DNS) query replies
TCP established
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) return traffic
FTP data connections
TFTP data connections
Multimedia connections
Explicitly permitted externally sourced traffic destined to protected internal addresses
VPN Traffic
Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP)
Network Address Translation (NAT) Traversal
Proprietary encapsulation
Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
Authentication Header (AH)
HTTP to web servers
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to web servers
FTP to FTP servers
Inbound FTP data connections
Inbound FTP passive (pasv) data connections
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
Other applications and servers
Inbound DNS queries
Inbound DNS zone transfers
Apply the ACL
The newly constructed ACL should be applied inbound on Internet-facing interfaces of the edge routers. In the example illustrated in the Typical Setup section, the ACL isapplied in on the Internet-facing interfaces on IR1 and IR2.
See the sections on deployment guidelines and deployment example for more details.

Note: Please keep these suggestions in mind when you apply the transit ACL.
The log keyword can be used in order to provide additional detail about source and destinations for a given protocol. Although this keyword provides valuable insight into the details of ACL hits, excessive hits to an ACL entry that uses the log keyword increase CPU utilization. The performance impact associated with logging varies by platform.
ICMP unreachable messages are generated for packets that are administratively denied by an ACL. This could impact router and link performance. Consider the use of the no ip unreachables command in order to disable IP unreachables on the interface where the transit (edge) ACL is deployed.
This ACL can be initially deployed with all permit statements in order to ensure that business legitimate traffic is not denied. Once business legitimate traffic has been identified and accounted for, the specific deny elements can be configured.
ACLs and Fragmented Packets
ACLs have a fragments keyword that enables specialized fragmented packet-handling behavior. In general, noninitial fragments that match the Layer 3 statements (protocol, source address, and destination address)â€”irrespective of the Layer 4 information in an ACLâ€”are affected by the permit or deny statement of the matched entry. Note that the use of the fragments keyword can force ACLs to either deny or permit noninitial fragments with more granularity.
Filtering fragments adds an additional layer of protection against a denial-of-service (DoS) attack that uses only noninitial fragments (such as FO > 0). The use of a deny statement for noninitial fragments at the beginning of the ACL denies all noninitial fragments from accessing the router. Under rare circumstances, a valid session might require fragmentation and therefore be filtered if a deny fragment statement exists in the ACL. Conditions that might lead to fragmentation include the use of digital certificates for ISAKMP authentication and the use of IPSec NAT Traversal.
For example, consider the partial ACL shown here.
access-list 110 deny tcp any Internet routable subnet fragments
access-list 110 deny udp any Internet routable subnet fragments
access-list 110 deny icmp any Internet routable subnet fragments
<rest of ACL>
Adding these entries to the beginning of an ACL denies any noninitial fragment access to the network, while nonfragmented packets or initial fragments pass to the next lines of the ACL unaffected by the deny fragment statements. The previous ACL snippet also facilitates classification of the attack since each protocolâ€”UDP, TCP, and ICMPâ€”increments separate counters in the ACL.
Since many attacks rely on flooding with fragmented packets, filtering incoming fragments to the internal network provides an added measure of protection and helps ensure that an attack cannot inject fragments by simply matching layer 3 rules in the transit ACL.
Refer to Access Control Lists and IP Fragments for a detailed discussion of the options.
Risk Assessment
When you deploy transit traffic protection ACLs, consider two key areas of risk.
Ensure that the appropriate permit/deny statements are in place. For the ACL to be effective, you must permit all required protocols.
ACL performance varies from platform to platform. Before you deploy ACLs, review the performance characteristics of your hardware.
Cisco recommends that you test this design in the lab prior to deployment.

Deployment Guidelines
Cisco recommends conservative deployment practices. You must have a clear understanding of required protocols in order to successfully deploy transit ACLs. These guidelines describe a very conservative method for the deployment of protection ACLs that use iterative approach.
Identify protocols used in the network with a classification ACL.
Deploy an ACL that permits all the known protocols that are used in the network. This discovery, or classification, ACL should have a source address of any and a destination of an IP address or the entire Internet-routable IP subnet. Configure a last entry that permits ip any any log in order to help identify additional protocols that you need to allow.
The objective is to determine all required protocols that are in use on the network. Use logging for analysis in order to determine what else might communicate with the router.
Note: Although the log keyword provides valuable insight into the details of ACL hits, excessive hits to an ACL entry that uses this keyword might result in an overwhelming number of log entries and possibly high router CPU usage. Use the log keyword for short periods of time and only when needed in order to help classify traffic.
Please note that the network is at risk of attack while an ACL that consists of all permit statements is in place. Perform the classification process as quickly as possible so that proper access controls can be put into place.
Review identified packets and begin to filter access to the internal network.
Once you have identified and reviewed the packets filtered by the ACL in step 1, update the classification ACL to account for newly identified protocols and IP addresses. Add ACL entries for anti-spoofing. As required, substitute specific deny entries for permit statements in the classification ACL. You can use the show access-list command to monitor specific deny entries can be monitored for hit count. This provides information about prohibited network access attempts without having to enable logging on ACL entries. The last line of the ACL should be a deny ip any any. Once again, the hit count against this last entry can provide information about prohibited access attempts.
Monitor and update the ACL.
Monitor the completed ACL in order to ensure that newly introduced required protocols are added in a controlled manner. If you monitor the ACL, it also provides information about prohibited network access attempts that could provide information about impending attacks.
Deployment Example
This example shows a transit ACL that protects a network based on this addressing.
The ISP router IP address is 10.1.1.1.
The edge router Internet-facing IP address is 10.1.1.2.
The Internet-routable subnet is 192.168.201.0 255.255.255.0.
The VPN headend is 192.168.201.100.
The web server is 192.168.201.101.
The FTP server is 192.168.201.102.
The SMTP server is 192.168.201.103.
The primary DNS server is 192.168.201.104.
The secondary DNS server is 172.16.201.50.
The transit protection ACL was developed based on this information. The ACL permits eBGP peering to the ISP router, provides anti-spoof filters, allows specific return traffic, allows specific inbound traffic, and explicitly denies all other traffic.
