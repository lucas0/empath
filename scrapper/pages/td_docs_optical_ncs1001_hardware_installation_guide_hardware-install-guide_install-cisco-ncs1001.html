The front and rear vertical rails of four post racks must be within this range (547 to 847 mm) to install NCS 1001. NCS 1001 cannot be installed on a four post rack if the distance between rails is outside this limit.
Install NCS 1001-K9 into EIA/ANSI Rack
In an EIA/ANSI rack, NCS 1001 can be installed in the front position.

Note
The rack is not provided by Cisco. Cisco provides only the chassis and the sliding rail.

Caution
Use only the fastening hardware provided with NCS 1001-K9 to prevent loosening, deterioration, and electromechanical corrosion of the hardware and joined material.
It is required to have 100 mm (3.94") space on the front and rear side of the rack to provide sufficient clearance for cable routing and cooling of the system.
In case of a closed cabinet, the cabinet must support the thermal management or front/rear doors need to have 70% perforation. Closed cabinets must have adequate airflow to dissipate maximum power from equipments in a fully-equipped cabinet.
NCS 1001-K9 shall be installed maintaining a minimum clearance of 5mm above and below the chassis.
Before you begin
Ensure the rack is compatible. See the Rack Comatibility section.
Procedure
Step 1
Identify and attach the sliding edge for the 2/4 post rack.
Step 2
Attach the sliding rail and L bracket to the left and right of the chassis using the screws (48-0471-01 and 48-2406-01) and tighten them to a torque value of 0.65 N-m (5.9 in-lbs) for 48-0471-01 screws and torque value of 1.5 N-m (13.25 in-lbs) for 48-2406-01 screws.

Step 3
Fix the Grounding extender to the chassis with the screws (48-1142-01) and tighten them to a torque value of 2.5 - 3.4 N-m (22.0 - 30.0 in-lbs).
Note 
The grounding extender must be assembled before installing NCS 1001 into the rack.

Install Two Post Slider into EIA/ANSI Rack
Step 5
Insert the chassis onto the sliding rail assembled on the two or four post 19" or 23" rack.
It is recommended to assemble the empty chassis to the rack for easy handling.

Step 6
As soon as the chassis is completely inserted, fasten the chassis with two screws (48-101524-01) on each side of the bracket and tighten them to a torque value of 3.4 N-m (30 in-lbs).
Caution 
The sliding rail must be used only during the first mounting process and it serves only to push the chassis into the rack and not for sliding purpose. The chassis must be fixed with screws on the front side.
Install Four Post Slider into EIA/ANSI Rack
Procedure
Step 1

Procedure
Step 1
Identify the two post slider.
Figure 16. Two Post Slider Identification
1
Check for the left/right marking on the sliders.
Check whether the two post width is 5" OR 3". If the width is 5", use the default slider assembly for 5".
If the post width is 3", modify the right/left sliders as shown below.
Step 2
Prepare the two post slider.

Ground NCS 1001

Caution
When terminating the frame ground, do not use soldering lug connectors, screwless (push-in) connectors, quick connect connectors, or other friction-fit connectors.
Procedure
Step 1
Verify that the office ground cable is connected to the top of the rack and the office ground, according to local site practice.
Step 2
Remove any paint and other nonconductive coatings from the surfaces between the shelf ground and bay frame ground point. Clean the mating surfaces and apply appropriate antioxidant compound to the bare conductors.
Step 3
Attach one end of the shelf ground cable (#8 AWG cable) to the ground point using the specified dual-hole lug connector. See Grounding Extender.

Step 4
Tighten the M4 pan-head screw to torque value of 1.3 N-m (11.5 in-lbs).
Step 5
Attach the other end of the shelf ground cable to the bay frame using a dual-hole lug connector according to the equipment rack frame specifications.
Cable Guide
The attachment of the cable guide is as shown below.
Figure 23. Cable Guide

Guide screws (part number - 48-0654-01)
The cable guide screw holding dome must face the inner side. Apply the torque value of 1.3 - 1.7 N-m (11.5 - 15.0 in-lbs) for 48-0654-01 screws. Based on the installation requirement, the cable guide can also be attached by rotating it by 180 degrees.
Power Supply
NCS 1001 has two slots for 600W AC redundant Power Supply Units (PSU). It is sufficient to have a single PSU inserted in the chassis to support all the features and provide power to all the pluggable modules. When only one PSU is inserted in the chassis, the Power Module Redundancy Lost major alarm is raised.

Caution
In case of single PSU, the other PSU slot must be inserted with the PSU filler module to guarantee safety and system cooling compliance.
Connect AC Power to NCS 1001

Caution
NCS 1001 relies on the protective devices in the building installation to protect against short circuit, overcurrent, and ground faults. Ensure that the protective devices comply with local and national electrical codes.
The voltage rating value for AC power ranges either between 200 V to 240 V or between 100 V to 127 V depending on the standards in various countries.

Note
A dual pole breaker is needed for the installation. The rating of the dual pole breaker is 16A for International and 20A for USA and Canada.
Figure 24. Hot Area on PSU Faceplate


Procedure
Step 1
Verify that the AC cable is installed in the correct AC source panel. Ensure that either the fuse is removed or the circuit breaker is in the off position and locked out.
Note 
For an AC power supply, fuse or breaker rating must not exceed 20A.
Step 2
Attach the AC power cable to the cable connector in the AC power module.
Step 3
Close the cable clamp to secure the power cable.

Step 4
Ensure that the lockout device is removed if installed and turn on the circuit breaker(s) to the shelf. Verify that the Green LED on the PSU is on.
Connect DC Power to NCS 1001

Caution
NCS 1001 relies on the protective devices in the building installation to protect against short circuit, overcurrent, and ground faults. Ensure that the protective devices comply with local and national electrical codes.
The system accepts a nominal input voltage of -48 VDC or -60 VDC at 15A, with an operational tolerance range of -40.5 to -72 VDC. A dual pole breaker per each power feed is needed for the installation. The rating of the breaker is 20A.
Figure 26. Hot Area on PSU Faceplate
Procedure
Step 1
Verify that the correct fuse panel is installed in the top mounting space.
Step 2
Measure and cut the cables as needed to reach NCS 1001 from the fuse panel.
Step 3
Dress the power according to local practice.
Step 4
Connect the office battery and return cables according to the fuse panel engineering specifications.
Step 5
Insert the DC connector into the DC receptacle on the power supply.

Step 6
Ensure that either the fuse is inserted or the circuit breaker is in the ON position. Verify that the Green LED on the PSU is on.
