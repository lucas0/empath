Introduction
This document describes how to configure identity services on a Cisco Catalyst 3850 Series switch with the Session Aware Networking framework. This is a new way to configure identity services (802.1x, MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB), WebAuth) that allows for greater flexibility and functionality. It uses the Cisco Common Classification Policy Language (C3PL) along with service templates that can be stored locally or on the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) server.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:
Catalyst 3850 Series Switch, Cisco IOSÂ® CLI
Cisco ISE
Identity Services (802.1x/MAB/WebAuth)
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
Catalyst 3850 Series Switch, Cisco IOS Version 03.03.00SE or later
Cisco ISE Version 1.2 or later
Note: Refer to the IBNS 2.0 Deployment Guide in order to view the support matrix.
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Background Information
Service templates contain a set of policy attributes that can be attached to a user session via a specific action in control policy. Two examples are presented in this document:
MAB and a locally-defined service template used for the failure scenario.
MAB and an ISE-defined service template used for the failure scenario.
MAB is used as the example in this document. However, it is possible to use 802.1x and/or WebAuth and build complex policies with C3PL.
Configure
Note: Use the Command Lookup Tool (registered customers only) in order to obtain more information on the commands used in this section.
Network Diagram
Both examples presented here involve a Windows PC that connects to the switch that performs MAB. The Windows MAC address is not configured on the ISE, which is why MAB fails. Then, the switch applies the policy defined in the service template.
Locally-Defined Service Template
After MAB failure, the switch applies the locally-defined service template.
Here is the flow:
Windows sends the Ethernet frame.

The switch performs MAB, and sends the RADIUS-Request towards ISE with the MAC address as a username.

The ISE does not have that endpoint configured, and returns RADIUS-Reject.

The switch activates the locally-defined template policy MAB_FAIL.
For more complete information, refer to Identity-Based Networking Services Configuration Guide, Cisco IOS XE Release 3SE (Catalyst 3850 Switches).
Here is a basic example:

Service Template Defined on ISE
Here is the flow:
Windows sends the Ethernet frame.

The switch performs MAB, and sends the RADIUS-Request towards the ISE with the MAC address as a username.

The ISE does not have that endpoint configured, and returns a RADIUS-Reject.

The switch activates the template policy MAB_FAIL with the ISE Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)-list. The RADIUS-Request is sent with the username as the template name (MAB_FAIL) and the hardcoded password: cisco123. Also, the Cisco Attribute Value (AV) Pair is attached download-request=service-template.

That AV Pair forces the ISE to treat that request as a service template request. All checks for authentication and authorization rules are omitted. The ISE only checks if the authorization profile with the same name (MAB_FAIL) exists. There is no need to configure the MAB_FAIL user in the local user store. Then, the ISE returns all the attributes associated with that profile, which is the Downloadable Access Control List (DACL) in this example.

If the DACL is not cached on the switch, it sends another RADIUS-Request for that DACL.

The DACL content is returned. The switch applies the policies.
ISE Configuration
After you add the Network Access Device, the Authorization Profile is required:
It is important to check the Service Template check box, and to use the same name as the one defined on the switch.
Catalyst 3850 Series Switch Configuration
This configuration has four differences from the first example:
The local MAB_FAIL_LOCAL policy template is removed.

Change of Authorization (CoA) support is added.

The ISE list for the MAB_FAIL policy template (policy configured on the ISE) is used.

An AAA authorization list for service template retrieval is named.
Here is the configuration:
aaa new-model
!
aaa group server radius ISE
 server name ISE
!
aaa authentication dot1x default group ISE
aaa authorization network default group ISE 
aaa authorization network ISE group ISE     <--- used to retrieve
service-template

You must configure RADIUS CoA support on the switch after you change the template (authorization profile) on the ISE, because it sends the CoA in order to update the template on the switch.

The Access Control List (ACL) is not visible under the interface:

It is possible to verify if ASIC (hardware) is programmed correctly:

    Input MAC ACL: label 0 h/w 0 (Group LE and label are not linked)
    Output MAC ACL: label 0 h/w 0 (Group LE and label are not linked)
Each user session that has a different DACL will have a separate entry programmed in ASIC. On the ISE, there are three separate authentications:
Failed MAB
Successful service template retrieval (MAB_FAIL)
Successful DACL retrieval
Here is a closer look at the steps when you receive the request for the service template:
  11001 Received RADIUS Access-Request
  11017 RADIUS created a new session
  11022 Added the dACL specified in the Authorization Profile
  11002 Returned RADIUS Access-Accept
This clearly shows that the Authentication/Authorization rules are not processed.

When there is no correct authorization profile on the ISE, it reports:
  11001 Received RADIUS Access-Request
  11017 RADIUS created a new session
  11003 Returned RADIUS Access-Reject
Also, the Event 5400 Authentication failed message is presented, but no more details are revealed. After you create the username with the cisco123 password, the error remains the same, even when there are correct Authentication/Authorization rules. The only requirement to have that feature work correctly is to have a correct authorization profile.
