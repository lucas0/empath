Beginner Information
Step 1
Open a web browser and navigate to the Cisco Software Downloads webpage.
Step 2
In the search bar, start typing 'Anyconnect' and the options will appear. Select AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client v4.x.
Step 3
Download the Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client. Most users will select the AnyConnect Pre-Deployment Package (Linux 64-bit) option.
The images in this article are for AnyConnect v4.9.x, which was latest version at the time of writing this document.
If you purchased a license and you are unable to download AnyConnect, call Cisco Global Service Relations at +1 919-993-2724. Select option 2. You will need to know your Cisco ID (the one you use to log into Cisco.com) and the sales order number when you call. They will get that situation all straightened out.
Step 4
Open the Terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard. To navigate to the folder where you have downloaded the AnyConnect Client Package, use the command, ‘cd directory name’. For more information on the ‘cd’ command, click here.
cd [Directory Name]
In this example, the file is placed on the Desktop.
The directory may be different based on the location of the AnyConnect file download. For long filenames or paths, start typing some characters and press the tab key on your keyboard. The filename will auto-populate. If it doesn't even after you press tab twice, it indicates that you need to type more number of unique characters. Alternately, you can use the 'ls' command to list the files in your current directory.
Step 5
The initial download is a tarball archive (several files packed into one), which must be extracted. The command ‘tar xvf filename’ will extract the contents to the same directory in which the initial file is located.
tar xvf [Filename]
For more information on the ‘tar’ command, click here.
Step 6
Once the folder is extracted, use the ‘cd directory name’ command again to navigate into the folder.
cd [Directory Name]
Step 7
After navigating into the main folder, ‘cd’ into the vpn sub-folder.
cd vpn
Step 8
To run the AnyConnect install script, type ‘sudo ./vpn_install.sh’. This will begin the installation process using superuser permissions.
sudo ./vpn_install.sh
For more details on the 'sudo' command, click here.
Step 9
Accept the terms in the license agreement to complete the installation by typing ‘y’.
y
The AnyConnect installation should complete, and the Terminal window can be closed.
Using AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client v4.9.x
Step 1
To access the Anyconnect app, open the Terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard. Use the command, ‘/opt/cisco/anyconnect/bin/vpnui’.
/opt/cisco/anyconnect/bin/vpnui
If you encounter any errors through the Terminal, you can access the app from the applications menu as shown below.
To access the applications menu using the User Interface (UI), click on the start icon (appears as nine dots on the lower left corner). Choose the Anyconnect app.
Alternatively, press Super+A (Super key is the windows icon key) on your keyboard to bring up the search bar. Start typing 'Anyconnect' and the app will appear.
Step 2
Click on the Anyconnect app.
Step 3
Enter the IP Address or Hostname of your desired server followed by the port number.
For RV340 family, the default port number is 8443.
Step 4
Some connections may not be secure using a trusted SSL certificate. By default, AnyConnect Client will block connection attempts to these servers.
Uncheck Block connections to untrusted servers to connect to these servers.
Uninstalling AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client v4.9.x
Step 1
Using Terminal, navigate to the folder that contains the uninstall shell script using the ‘cd’ command.
In a default installation, these files will be located in /opt/cisco/anyconnect/bin/.
Step 2
To run the Anyconnect uninstall script, enter ‘sudo ./vpn_uninstall.sh’
This will begin the uninstall process using superuser permissions. For more information on the 'sudo' command, click here.
Step 3
At the prompt, enter the sudo password and the client software will complete uninstallation.
