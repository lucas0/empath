Introduction to firewall solutions
Firewall solutions for small business are available as either software or hardware (with software components). Software firewalls protect each individual PC they're installed on. But to protect all your company's computers, each must have a software firewall installed. That can get expensive and be difficult to maintain.
On the other hand, hardware-based firewall solutions for small business protect all computers on your network. A hardware-based firewall is easier to administer, too.
