  General Questions Regarding Warranty
Q.  What is the role of a Cisco warranty?
A.   Warranty is to remedy manufacturing defects, not issues relating to the proper operation of devices or systems. Cisco’s standard 90-day warranty is typically a sufficient amount of time to uncover manufacturing defects not found during the robust quality assurance processes; however, some products have longer warranty periods.
Q.  What is included in a Cisco warranty?
A.   Warranties provide limited liability for Cisco or its designated representative to repair and/or replace manufacturing defects in Cisco products. They are generally limited in both the duration and the support they offer. Warranties generally do not include Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) support, software updates, or any of the additional benefits obtained under a support service contract. It is the responsibility of Cisco or Cisco’s designated representative to repair and/or replace the Cisco product within the time frame identified in the warranty card or license agreement that accompanied the originally purchased Cisco product. Cisco reserves the right to refund the purchase price as its exclusive warranty remedy.
Elements covered under a Cisco warranty are:
●   Hardware: This guarantees that the hardware will be free of defects in material and workmanship under normal use, or it will be replaced by Cisco or Cisco’s designated representative.
●   Software: This guarantees that the physical media are free from defects, or they will be replaced by Cisco. Also, the warranty guarantees that the software generally conforms to the published specifications for the product. Software is provided "as is," and in no event does Cisco warrant that the software is error free or that customer will be able to operate the software without problems or interruptions. Warranty does not include software updates.
Note: Some Cisco Catalyst fixed switches are covered by the Cisco Catalyst OS software update policy. The software policy is not a part of warranty and is subject to change without notice.
Q.  How do I receive warranty support?
A.   Warranty support varies by Product and by Theater. Please answer the following questions and use the grids below to find how your warranty is supported.
●   What is the warranty type for your product? (Enhanced Limited Lifetime Warranty [ELLW], Unified Computing System [UCS], and Small Business are exceptions)

Q.  How do I know which warranty applies to my product?
A.   You can use our Warranty Finder to determine which Cisco warranty applies to a specific product or product family.
Q.  What events, activities, or actions invalidate my warranty?
A.   Non-entitlement to the Cisco warranty can occur when equipment is destroyed or scrapped, is determined to be non-genuine, is purchased on the secondary or “gray” market, or is stolen. For information about non-entitlement, review the current policy document on the Cisco Legal Website.
Q.  Is the Cisco product warranty transferable?
A.   No. The Cisco product warranty is nontransferable. A warranty is provided solely to the original end user of the equipment.
For more information regarding the Cisco Hardware Inspection and Software Relicensing Program for used and secondary market Cisco equipment, visit the Cisco Hardware Inspection and Software Relicensing Program page.
Questions Regarding Product Returns
Q.  What happens when a hardware failure is identified?
A.   After Cisco determines you have experienced a hardware failure and are entitled to replacement part(s), Cisco or Cisco’s representative will issue you an RMA and provide you with information about your advance part replacement shipment. Before an RMA is issued, you must specify the part number and serial number of each part to be replaced. Replacement hardware may be new or like-new.
Q.  Why do I still have to go through the Cisco warranty troubleshooting process when I know what the problem is with a particular part?
A.   When a warranty request is logged, the warranty support engineer will troubleshoot the issue to identify the faulty part, which might be a symptom of a larger problem. Even though it might seem quicker and easier to just send a part, if the part arrives and still does not resolve your problem, this only delays the resolution.
Q.  How can I track the status of my RMA?
A.   If you have an open warranty request, you can contact Cisco using the contact numbers. Or a return may be tracked at the Cisco Returns Portal.
Q.  What happens if my warranty period expires during the RMA process?
A.   An RMA request is treated as in-warranty as long as it was initiated during the warranty period. The request is considered initiated after Cisco is contacted regarding the possible hardware issue even if the Cisco TAC does not complete the troubleshooting process and issue the RMA until after the warranty period expires.
Q.  What are my responsibilities as a customer for returning parts under advance replacement?
A.   Returning parts to Cisco is your legal obligation. Cisco advances replacement parts to you because we know that these parts are needed for your mission-critical activities. After replacement, these parts belong to Cisco and are tracked accordingly. Within 10 days after you receive any advance replacement part, you must return the corresponding replaced part to Cisco, so it can be repaired and returned to Cisco’s working inventory. If you are unable to return any replaced part within 10 days, you are required to contact the Cisco asset recovery team in your region. Failure to return parts might result in Cisco invoicing your company for the part at list price or taking other appropriate action.

Q.  How do I know if Cisco has received parts I returned?
A.   An in-process Return Material Authorizations may be tracked with the Cisco Returns Portal. You can enter your RMA number and check if the part has been received. Or you may contact Cisco to check status of a return.
Q.  Are my advance replacement parts new?
A.   Replacement parts provided to you will be new or functionally equivalent to new, at Cisco’s discretion; and Cisco certifies the parts as functional at the same level as new. This is an industry standard practice. In general, for newer products, Cisco is more likely to provide new parts. However, as products mature, Cisco establishes repair facilities to provide replacement parts.
Q.  What quality process does Cisco use for repairs?
A.   Cisco repairs only those parts that can be restored to a state functionally equivalent to new. Any part that does not meet this standard is automatically removed from inventory.
Q.  Why can a Cisco Warranty RMA take longer to arrive than a Service RMA?
A.   Different types of Cisco warranties are available with entitlement terms of either Return To Factory (RTF) or Advanced Replacement (A/R) *. These may have different time periods for the warranty return to be shipped, for example a 10 DAY A/R entitlement ships to the warranty holder within 10 business days of Cisco creating the RMA claim and before product return to Cisco. Actual delivery dates are based on local services.
Cisco Service offerings provide a number of paid support options based on planned local stocking to minimize RMA delay. Your Warranty RMA is shipped from a centralized depot and could be from outside your local region depending on stock availability, adding shipping time and possible import delays.
*Note: Cisco no longer offers Return For Repair (RFR) Service Provider Warranties as of March 2018.
Q.  Why is warranty not sufficient for supporting the evolving network?
A.   In business-critical environments, reliance on warranty is not a standard or advisable business practice. As Cisco customers move from point-product buying decisions to architectural buying decisions, the role of support has changed. Software is providing more services over the network, and the level of support needed to make sure the software investment is protected is greater as well. Service deployment tactics need to be planned and designed to scale and to provide the flexibility to adapt to new needs. This sort of system-wide approach means customers need to be engaged more closely with Cisco experts, and warranty does not provide that.
