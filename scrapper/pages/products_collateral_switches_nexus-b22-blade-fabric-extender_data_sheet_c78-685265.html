    Product overview
The Cisco Nexus® B22 Blade Fabric Extender is designed to simplify data center server access architecture and operations in environments in which third-party blade servers are used. The Cisco Nexus B22, together with the Cisco Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders, Cisco® Adapter Fabric Extender (Adapter FEX), and Cisco Data Center Virtual Machine Fabric Extender (VM-FEX), is part of the Cisco Fabric Extender (FEX) portfolio, which provides a highly scalable unified server access platform supporting 100 Megabit to 10 Gigabit Ethernet over fiber and copper, rack and blade form factors, and IEEE Data Center Bridging (DCB) protocol. The platform offers excellent support for the integration of third-party blade chassis into a Cisco Unified Fabric.
The Cisco Nexus B22 Blade Fabric Extender behaves like a remote line card for a parent Cisco Nexus switch, together forming a distributed modular system. This architecture simplifies data center access operations and architecture by combining the management simplicity of a single high-density access switch with the cabling simplicity of integrated blade switches and Top-of-Rack (ToR) access switches (Figure 1).
Figure 1.            
Cisco Nexus Fabric extenders provide highly scalable unified server access connectivity
The Cisco Nexus B22 provides the following main benefits:
●      Highly scalable, consistent server access: The distributed modular system creates a scalable server access environment with no reliance on Spanning Tree Protocol, providing consistency between blade and rack servers.
●      Simplified operations: One single point of management and policy enforcement using upstream Cisco Nexus switches eases the commissioning and decommissioning of blades through zero-touch installation and automatic configuration of fabric extenders.
●      Increased business benefits: Consolidation, cabling reduction, investment protection through feature inheritance from the parent switch, and the capability to add functions without the need for a major equipment upgrade of server-attached infrastructure all contribute to reduced Operating Expenses (OpEx) and Capital Expenditures (CapEx).
Each member of the Cisco Nexus B22 platform transparently integrates into the I/O module slot of a third-party blade chassis, drawing both power and cooling from the blade chassis itself.
The Cisco Nexus B22 provides two types of ports:
●      Ports for blade server attachment (host interfaces)
●      Uplink ports (fabric interfaces)
Fabric interfaces, located on the front of the Cisco Nexus B22 module, are for connectivity to the upstream parent Cisco Nexus switch.
The Cisco Nexus B22 comes in four models. Figure 2 shows the Cisco Nexus B22 Blade Fabric Extender for HP. Figure 3 shows the Cisco Nexus B22 Blade Fabric Extender for Fujitsu. Figure 4 show the Cisco Nexus B22 Blade Fabric Extender for Dell. Figure 5 shows the Cisco Nexus B22 Blade Fabric Extender for IBM.

Features and benefits
●      Highly scalable, consistent access layer: Today's data centers must have massive scalability to manage the combination of an increasing number of blade servers and a higher demand for bandwidth from each server. The Cisco Nexus B22 increases the scalability of the blade access layer to accommodate both sets of demands without increasing management points within the network.
◦    Massive scalability: A deployment of Cisco Nexus B22 Blade Fabric Extenders and Cisco Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders connected to a Cisco Nexus parent switch supports highly scalable 1 and 10 Gigabit Ethernet environments under a single managed entity. Scalability limits are shown in Table 2, in the Scalability row.
◦    Layer 2 dependability: Reliance on Spanning Tree Protocol is eliminated between the fabric extender and the parent switch, thus enabling a large, multipath, loop-free topology. Use of a single management entity to support a large server domain allows policy to be enforced more efficiently and enhances Layer 2 data center access scalability. Use of the virtual PortChannel (vPC) feature allows fast convergence and effective utilization of bandwidth in Layer 2 environments.
◦    Consistent server access architecture: When mixed with the Cisco Nexus 2000 Series, the Cisco Nexus B22 provides a highly consistent server access architecture supporting 1 to 10 Gigabit Ethernet blade server connections and 100 Megabit to 10 Gigabit Ethernet rack server connections over both fiber and copper, supporting unified fabric and the IEEE DCB protocol.
●      Simplified operations: The Cisco Nexus B22 simplifies operations and management.
◦    Single point of management: Cisco Nexus B22 Blade Fabric Extenders are remote line cards for a Cisco Nexus parent switch. All device configurations are managed on the Cisco Nexus parent switch, and configuration information is downloaded to the Cisco Nexus B22 using in-band communication.
◦    Software maintenance simplification: The Cisco Nexus B22 software is embedded in the Cisco Nexus parent switch software. The fabric extender is a “plug-and-play” device that automatically downloads the software image from the Cisco Nexus parent switch in the same way that a line card downloads software from the supervisor engine in a modular chassis. In-Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) on the fabric extenders provides the capability to perform transparent software upgrades, reducing downtime and allowing customers to integrate the newest features and functions with little or no impact on network operation for Ethernet, storage, and converged network environments.
◦    Switch feature consistency across a large number of servers: The Cisco Nexus B22 forwards all traffic to the parent Cisco Nexus switch over 10 Gigabit Ethernet fabric uplinks. Passing all traffic to the parent switch allows traffic to be switched according to policies established on the parent Cisco Nexus switch with a single point of management. Standardizing on the Cisco Nexus switches for both blade and rack servers allows data centers to support the same switch features across the entire access layer with a single point of management.
◦    Tenfold reduction in management points: The number of management points is significantly less than when discrete switches are used in the blade chassis. A traditional 12-blade chassis design using a discrete, redundant pair of Gigabit Ethernet blade switches has 24 management points. The equivalent architecture using the Cisco Nexus B22 has only 2 management points: a tenfold reduction in management complexity.
●      Business benefits: The Cisco Nexus B22 offers a number of benefits to enhance the overall business.
◦    Cost-effective 10 Gigabit Ethernet solution: The Cisco Nexus B22 is an excellent platform for migration from 1 Gigabit Ethernet to 10 Gigabit Ethernet. Scalable 10 Gigabit Ethernet provides 10 times the bandwidth for approximately twice the price of 1 Gigabit Ethernet.
◦    Consolidation: The Cisco Nexus B22 protects investment into the future, supporting evolving data center needs by providing an easy migration path to low-latency 10 Gigabit Ethernet, High-Performance Computing (HPC), virtual machine-aware networks. In addition, the combination of the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series and the Cisco Nexus B22 provides a unified network fabric that supports LAN and SAN consolidation. Another benefit of the Cisco fabric extender architecture is the capability to collapse data center access and aggregation layers into one single layer.
◦    Investment protection: The Cisco Nexus B22 Blade Fabric Extenders can be mixed and matched with Cisco Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders under a common parent Cisco Nexus switch. New functions can be derived from upstream Cisco Nexus switches, resulting in the capability to add new functions without the need for a major equipment upgrade.
◦    Cabling reduction with unified fabric: The Cisco Nexus B22 can pass Ethernet and Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) traffic over the same set of uplinks onto the Cisco Nexus fabric, reducing the total number of uplinks required.
◦    The Cisco Nexus B22 supports an optimal cabling strategy that simplifies network operations and prepares for future technologies. Low-cost connections of up to 10 meters to the Cisco Nexus parent switch can be made with copper Twinax cable, and longer connections of up to 100 meters can use the Cisco Fabric Extender Transceiver (FET). Standard 10-Gbps optics such as Short Reach (SR) and Long Reach (LR) are also supported for distances greater than 100 meters.
◦    Effective bandwidth utilization: Today’ blade servers are typically dual-homed to the network. Through vPC feature support, each server can bond its network adapters together into a 20-Gbps or higher PortChannel, achieving both high bandwidth and link redundancy.
◦    Reduced power and cooling: Cost-effective 10 Gigabit Ethernet solutions, optimal cabling, device consolidation, and efficient bandwidth utilization all contribute to a significant reduction in power and cooling needs in the data center.
Cisco Nexus B22 deployment scenarios
The Cisco Nexus B22 can be used in conjunction with a Cisco Nexus parent switch in four main design scenarios (shown in Figure 6):
●      Server vPC: In this deployment scenario, access-layer redundancy is achieved through redundant server connections to two fabric extenders, using vPC and active-active server Network Interface Card (NIC) teaming.
●      Fabric extender vPC (FEX vPC): In this deployment scenario, access-layer redundancy is achieved through redundant connections between the Cisco Nexus B22 Blade Fabric Extenders and the Cisco Nexus parent switches using vPC.
●      Enhanced vPC (EvPC): In this deployment scenario, access-layer redundancy is achieved in two ways: through redundant connections between the Cisco Nexus B22 Blade Fabric Extenders and the Cisco Nexus parent switches using vPC, and through redundant server connections to two fabric extenders using vPC and active-active server NIC teaming.
●      vPC+: In this deployment scenario, access-layer redundancy is achieved through server vPC, FEX vPC, and EvPC. In addition, a vPC+ domain allows the Cisco Nexus parent switch and the fabric extenders to be viewed as a single virtual switch in a Cisco FabricPath network.
