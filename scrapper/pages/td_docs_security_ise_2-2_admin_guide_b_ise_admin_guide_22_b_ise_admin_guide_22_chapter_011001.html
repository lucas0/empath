Monitoring and Troubleshooting Service in Cisco ISE
The Monitoring and Troubleshooting (MnT) service is a comprehensive identity solution for all Cisco ISE run-time services. The Operations menu contains the following components, and can be viewed only from the primary Policy Administration Node (PAN). Note that the Operations menu does not appear in the primary Monitoring node.
Monitoring: Provides real-time presentation of meaningful data representing the state of access activities on a network. This insight allows you to easily interpret and monitor operational conditions.
Troubleshooting: Provides contextual guidance for resolving access issues on networks. You can then address user concerns and provide resolution in a timely manner.
Reporting: Provides a catalog of standard reports that you can use to analyze trends and monitor system performance and network activities. You can customize reports in various ways and save them for future use. You can search records using wild cards and multiple values in all the reports for the Identity, Endpoint ID, and ISE Node (except the Health Summary report) fields.

Cisco ISE Dashboard
Network Privilege Framework Event Flow Process
User Roles and Permissions for Monitoring and Troubleshooting Capabilities
Data Stored in the Monitoring Database
Cisco ISE Dashboard
The Cisco ISE dashboard or home page (Home > Summary) is the landing page that you view after you log in to the Cisco ISE administration portal. The dashboard is a centralized management console consisting of metric meters along the top of the window, with dashlets below. The default dashboards are Summary, Endpoints, Guests, Vulnerability, and Threat.

Note
You can view this dashboard data only in the Cisco ISE primary PAN portal.
The dashboard’s real-time data provides an at-a-glance status of the devices and users accessing your network, and an overview of the system's health.

Note
You must install Adobe Flash Player to be able to view the dashlets and all the corresponding drill-down windows.
Click the gear icon in the second level menu bar for a drop-down list of dashboard settings. The following table contains descriptions for the dashboard settings options available in the drop-down list:
Drop-Down List Option

You can delete a dashboard that you have created by clicking the close (x) icon next to the corresponding custom dashboard.

Note
You cannot rename or delete a default dashboard.
Each dashlet has a toolbar at the top-right corner where you can perform the following operations:
Detach: To view a dashlet in a separate window.
Refresh: To refresh a dashlet.
Remove: To remove a dashlet from the dashboard.
You can drag and drop the dashlet using the gripper icon that is present at the top-left corner of the dashlet.
The Alarms dashlet contains a quick filter for the Severity column. You can filter alarms by their severity by choosing Critical, Warning, or Info from the Severity drop-down list.
Network Privilege Framework Event Flow Process
The Network Privilege Framework (NPF) authentication and authorization event flow uses the process described in the following table:
Process Stage
Description
1
Network Access Device (NAD) performs either a normal authorization or a flex authorization.
2
An unknown agentless identity is profiled with web authorization.
3
A RADIUS server authenticates and authorizes the identity.
4
Authorization is provisioned for the identity at the port.
5
Unauthorized endpoint traffic is dropped.
User Roles and Permissions for Monitoring and Troubleshooting Capabilities
Monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities are associated with default user roles. The tasks you are allowed to perform are directly related to your assigned user role.
See Cisco ISE Administrator Groups for information on the permissions and restrictions set for each user role.

Note
Accessing Cisco ISE using the root shell without Cisco TAC supervision is not supported, and Cisco is not responsible for any service disruption that might be caused as a result.
Data Stored in the Monitoring Database
The Cisco ISE monitoring service collects and stores data in a specialized monitoring database. The rate and amount of data utilized to monitor network functions may require a node dedicated solely to monitoring. If your Cisco ISE network collects logging data at a high rate from policy service nodes or network devices, we recommend a Cisco ISE node dedicated to monitoring.
To manage the information stored in the monitoring database, perform full and incremental backups of the database. This includes purging unwanted data and then restoring the database.
Related Concepts
Monitoring Database
Device Configuration for Monitoring
The MnT node receives and uses data from the devices on a network to populate the dashboard display. To enable communication between the MnT node and the network devices, the switches and NADs must be configured properly.
Troubleshooting the Cisco AnyConnect Agent Download Issues
If a Policy Service Node (PSN) goes down during network setup assistance while downloading Cisco AnyConnect, redownload the AnyConnect agent from the client provisioning portal and run the complete flow again.

Note
Cisco ISE does not support ARM64 version of AnyConnect for AnyConnect posture flow. Ensure that you do not use the ARM64 version of AnyConnect in the client provisioning policy, otherwise it might cause failure on the client side. Restart the client if Anyconnect is not working properly because of this issue.
Troubleshooting the Profiler Feed
The Test Feed Service Connection button on Administration > Feed Service > Profiler verifies that there is a connection to the Cisco feed server, and that the certificate is valid.
If the test is able to connect to the Cisco feed server, a pop-up window is displayed with a message stating that the test connection is successful.
If the connection fails, the area adjacent to the Test Feed Service Connection button displays a response from the server, which is similar to the following example in which the important part of the message is in bold:
Test result: Failure: FeedService test connection failed : Feed Service unavailable : SocketTimeoutException invoking https://ise.cisco.com:8443/feedserver/feed/serverinfo: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException:PKIX path building failed: Sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException Unable to find valid certification path to requested target
Here are some possible error messages, and the corresponding actions to be taken:
Unable to find valid certification path to requested target: This message indicates that the certificate that the feed server used is not valid. Verify that you have enabled the Verisign certificates.
No route to host: Verify that you have a working connection to an outside network from the Cisco ISE server.
UnknownHostException (at the beginning of an error message): Verify that you have a working connection to an outside network from the Cisco ISE server.
Posture Compliance
The Posture Compliance dashlet provides information about the users who are accessing the network, and whether they are posture compliant. The data that is displayed is for devices that are currently connected to the network. The stack bars show noncompliance statistics, and are arranged according to the operating system and other criteria. Spark lines represent the percentage of compliant versus noncompliant posture attempts.
Check Posture Compliance
Check Posture Compliance
Procedure
Step 1
Log in to Cisco ISE and access the dashboard.
Step 2
In the Posture Compliance dashlet, hover your cursor over a stack bar or sparkline.
A tooltip provides detailed information.
Step 3
Expand the data categories for more information.
Step 4
Expand the Posture Compliance dashlet.
A detailed real-time report is displayed.
Note 
You can view the posture compliance report in the Context Visibility window. Navigate Context Visibility > Endpoints > Compliance. This window displays different charts based on Compliance Status, Location, Endpoints, and Applications by Categories.
You might see the posture status for endpoints that do not have any active sessions. For example, if the last known posture status for an endpoint is Compliant, the status remains Compliant in the Context Visibility window until the next update is received for the endpoint, even if the endpoint session is terminated. The posture status is retained in the Context Visibility window until that endpoint is deleted or purged.
SNMP Traps to Monitor Cisco ISE
SNMP traps help you to monitor the status of Cisco ISE. If you want to monitor Cisco ISE without accessing the Cisco ISE server, you can configure a MIB browser as an SNMP host in Cisco ISE. You can then monitor the status of Cisco ISE from the MIB browser.
See the Cisco Identity Services Engine CLI Reference Guide for information on the snmp-server host and snmp-server trap commands.
Cisco ISE supports SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, and SNMPv3.
Cisco ISE sends the following generic system traps if you configure the SNMP host from the CLI:
Cold start: When the device reboots.
Linkup: When Ethernet interface is up.
Linkdown: When Ethernet interface is down.
Authentication failure: When the community strings do not match.
The following table lists the generic SNMP traps that are generated by default in Cisco ISE.
OID
Description
Trap Example
.1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.4.0.3 \n
NET-SNMP-AGENT-MIB::nsNotifyRestart
Indicates that the agent has been restarted.
DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::sysUpTimeInstance = Timeticks: (478) 0:00:04.78       SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapOID.0 = OID: NET-SNMP-AGENT-MIB::nsNotifyRestart    SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapEnterprise.0 = OID: NET-SNMP-MIB::netSnmpNotificationPrefix
.1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.4.0.2 \n
NET-SNMP-AGENT-MIB::nsNotifyShutdown
Indicates that the agent is in the process of being shut down.
DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::sysUpTimeInstance = Timeticks: (479) 0:00:04.79 SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapOID.0 = OID: NET-SNMP-AGENT-MIB::nsNotifyShutdown SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapEnterprise.0 = OID: NET-SNMP-MIB::netSnmpNotificationPrefix
.1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.4 \n
IF-MIB::linkUp
Signifies that the SNMP entity, acting in an agent role, has detected that the ifOperStatus object for one of its communication links left the Down state and transitioned into some other state (but not into the notPresent state). This other state is indicated by the included value of ifOperStatus.
DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::sysUpTimeInstance = Timeticks: (478) 0:00:04.78 SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapOID.0 = OID: IF-MIB::linkUp IF-MIB::ifIndex.12 = INTEGER: 12 IF-MIB::ifAdminStatus.12 = INTEGER: up(1) IF-MIB::ifOperStatus.12 = INTEGER: up(1) SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapEnterprise.0 = OID: NET-SNMP-MIB::netSnmpAgentOIDs.10
.1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.3 \n
IF-MIB::linkDown
Signifies that the SNMP entity, acting in an agent role, has detected that the ifOperStatus object for one of its communication links is about to enter the Down state from some other state (but not from the notPresent state). This other state is indicated by the included value of ifOperStatus.
DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::sysUpTimeInstance = Timeticks: (479) 0:00:04.79 SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapOID.0 = OID: IF-MIB::linkDown IF-MIB::ifIndex.5 = INTEGER: 5 IF-MIB::ifAdminStatus.5 = INTEGER: up(1) IF-MIB::ifOperStatus.5 = INTEGER: down(2) SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapEnterprise.0 = OID: NET-SNMP-MIB::netSnmpAgentOIDs.10
.1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.1 \n
SNMPv2-MIB::coldStart
Signifies that the SNMP entity, supporting a notification originator application, is reinitializing itself and that its configuration may have been altered.
DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::sysUpTimeInstance = Timeticks: (8) 0:00:00.08 SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapOID.0 = OID: SNMPv2-MIB::coldStart SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapEnterprise.0 = OID: NET-SNMP-MIB::netSnmpAgentOIDs.10
Process-Monitoring SNMP Traps in Cisco ISE
Cisco ISE allows you to send hrSWRunName traps for Cisco ISE process statuses to the SNMP manager if you configure an SNMP host from the Cisco ISE CLI. Cisco ISE uses a cron job to trigger these traps. The cron job retrieves the Cisco ISE process status from Monit. After you configure the SNMP-Server Host command from the CLI, a cron job runs every five minutes and monitors Cisco ISE.

Note
When an ISE process is manually stopped by an admin, Monit for the process also stops and no traps are sent to the SNMP manager. A process-stop SNMP trap is sent to the SNMP manager only when a process accidentally shuts down and is not automatically revived.
The following is a list of process-monitoring SNMP traps in Cisco ISE.
OID
Description
Trap Example
.1.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.2 \n
HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSWRunName
A textual description of this running piece of software, including the manufacturer, revision, and the name by which it is commonly known. If this software was installed locally, this must be the same string as that used in the corresponding hrSWInstalledName. The services considered are app-server, rsyslog, redis-server, ad-connector, mnt-collector, mnt-processor, ca-server est-server, and elasticsearch.
DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::sysUpTimeInstance = Timeticks: (63692139) 7 days, 8:55:21.39 SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapOID.0 = OID: HOSTRESOURCES- MIB::hrSWRunName HOSTRESOURCES- MIB::hrSWRunName = STRING: "redis-server:Running"
Cisco ISE sends traps for the following statuses to the configured SNMP server:
Process Start (monitored state)
Process Stop (not monitored state)
Execution Failed: When the process state changes from Monitored to Execution Failed, a trap is sent.
Does Not Exist: When the process state changes from Monitored to Does Not Exist, a trap is sent.
A unique object ID (OID) is generated for every object in the SNMP server and a value is assigned to the OID. You can find the object with its OID value in the SNMP server. The OID value for a running trap is running, and the OID value for the Not monitored, Does not exist, and Execution failed traps is stopped.
Cisco ISE sends traps using the OID of hrSWRunName that belongs to the HOST-RESOURCES MIB, and sets the OID value as < PROCESS NAME > - < PROCESS STATUS >, for example, runtime - running.
To stop Cisco ISE from sending SNMP traps to the SNMP server, remove the SNMP configuration from the Cisco ISE CLI. This operation stops sending SNMP traps and polling from the SNMP manager.
Disk Utilization SNMP Traps in Cisco ISE
When a Cisco ISE partition reaches its threshold disk utilization limit and the configured amount of free space is reached, the disk utilization trap is sent.

Note
Cisco ISE does not have any MIB for process status or disk utilization. Cisco ISE uses OID HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSWRunName for sending SNMP trap. You cannot use SNMP walk or SNMP get command to query the process status or disk utilization.
The following is a list of disk utilization SNMP traps that can be configured in Cisco ISE:
OID
Description
Trap Example
.1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.9.1.9 \n
UCD-SNMP-MIB::dskPercent
Percentage of space used in the disk.
DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::sysUpTimeInstance = Timeticks: (118198297) 13 days, 16:19:42.97 SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapOID.0 = OID: UCD-SNMP-MIB::dskPercent UCD-SNMP-MIB::dskPercent = INTEGER: 13
.1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.9.1.2 \n
UCD-SNMP-MIB::dskPath
Path where the disk is mounted.
dskPath can send traps for all the mount points in the output of the ISE admin command show disks .
DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::sysUpTimeInstance = Timeticks: (118198304) 13 days, 16:19:43.04       SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapOID.0 = OID: UCD-SNMP-MIB::dskPath  UCD-SNMP-MIB::dskPath = STRING: /opt
Cisco ISE Alarms
Alarms notify you of critical conditions on a network and are displayed in the Alarms dashlet. They also provide information on system activities, such as data purge events. You can either configure how you want to be notified about system activities, or disable them entirely. You can also configure the threshold for certain alarms.
Most alarms do not have an associated schedule and are sent immediately after an event occurs. At any given point in time, only the latest 15,000 alarms are retained.
If the event recurs, the same alarms are suppressed for about an hour. During the time that the event recurs, depending on the trigger, it may take about an hour for the alarms to reappear.
The following table lists all the Cisco ISE alarms, descriptions, and their resolution.

System Health
High Disk I/O Utilization
Cisco ISE system is experiencing high disk I/O utilization.
Check if the system has sufficient resources. Check the actual amount of work on the system, for example, number of authentications, profiler activity, and so on. Add an additional server to distribute the load.
High Disk Space Utilization
Cisco ISE system is experiencing high disk space utilization.
Check if the system has sufficient resources. Check the actual amount of work on the system, for example, number of authentications, profiler activity, and so on. Add an additional server to distribute the load.
High Load Average
Cisco ISE system is experiencing high load average.
Check if the system has sufficient resources. Check the actual amount of work on the system, for example, number of authentications, profiler activity, and so on. Add an additional server to distribute the load.
Do not use third-party tools to check the load average on a single CPU core because this metric would not reflect the overall system load. We recommend that you use the tech top command in the Cisco ISE CLI for a cumulative view of the system load.
If the High Load Average alarm is seen against 2:00 a.m. time stamps for Primary and Secondary MnT nodes, note that CPU usage might be high due to DBMS statistics being run at that hour. CPU usage will be back to normal after the DBMS stats is complete.
A High Load Average alarm is triggered at 1:00 a.m. every Sunday by a weekly maintenance task. This maintenance task rebuilds all the indexes that occupy more than 1 GB space. This alarm can be ignored.
High Memory Utilization
Cisco ISE system is experiencing high memory utilization.
Check if the system has sufficient resources. Check the actual amount of work on the system, for example, number of authentications, profiler activity, and so on. Add an additional server to distribute the load.
Do not use third-party tools to check memory utilization. We recommend that you use the show memory command in the Cisco ISE CLI to check memory utilization.
In a Cisco ISE node, its operating system manages memory utilization. You must check for the available memory (instead of free memory) metric for a more reliable measure of memory utilization.
Note that an operating system segments most of the memory in buffer or cache. If less than 90% of the total memory is displayed as used, and there is no substantial increase in swap memory, Cisco ISE memory utilization can be considered stable.
High Operations DB Usage
Cisco ISE monitoring nodes are experiencing higher volume of syslog data than expected.
Check and reduce the purge configuration window for the operations data.

Alarm Syslog Collection Location
Alarm Syslog Collection Location
If you configure monitoring functions to send alarm notifications as syslog messages, you need a syslog target to receive the notification. Alarm syslog targets are the destinations where alarm syslog messages are sent.

Note
Cisco ISE monitoring requires that the logging-source interface configuration use the network access server (NAS) IP address. You must configure a switch for Cisco ISE monitoring.
You must also have a system that is configured as a syslog server to be able to receive syslog messages. You can create, edit, and delete alarm syslog targets.
To configure a remote logging target as an alarm target, perform this procedure.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Administration > System > Logging > Remote Logging Targets.
Step 2
Click Add.
Step 3

Live Authentications
You can monitor recent RADIUS authentications as they occur, from the Live Authentications window. The window displays the top ten RADIUS authentications in the last 24 hours. This section explains the functions of the Live Authentications window.
The Live Authentications window shows the live authentication entries corresponding to the authentication events as they happen. In addition to authentication entries, this window also shows the live session entries corresponding to the events. You can also drill-down a session to view a detailed report corresponding to that session.
The Live Authentications window provides a tabular account of recent RADIUS authentications, in the order in which they occur. The last update shown at the bottom of the Live Authentications window shows the date of the server, time, and timezone.

Note
If the password attribute in an Access-Request packet is empty, an error message is triggered and the access request fails.
When a single endpoint is authenticated successfully, two entries appear in the Live Authentications window—one corresponding to the authentication record and another corresponding to the session record (pulled from the session live view). Subsequently, when the device performs another successful authentication, the repeat counter corresponding to the session record is incremented. The Repeat Counter that appears in the Live Authentications window shows the number of duplicate RADIUS authentication success messages that are suppressed.
See the Live Authentication data categories that are shown by default. These are described in the Recent RADIUS Authentications section.
You can choose to view all the columns, or only selected data columns. After selecting the columns that you want to be displayed, you can save your selections.

Filter Data in the Live Authentications Page
Filter Data in the Live Authentications Page
Using the filters in the Live Authentications window, you can filter the information that you need, and troubleshoot network authentication issues quickly. You can filter records in the Authentication Live Logs window and view only those records that you are interested in. The authentication logs contain many details, and filtering the authentications by a particular user or location helps you scan the data quickly. You can use several operators that are available in the Live Authentications window to filter out records based on your search criteria.:
'abc' : Contains 'abc'
'!abc' : Does not contain 'abc'
'{}' : Is empty
'!{}' : Is not empty
'abc*' : Starts with 'abc'
'*abc' : Ends with 'abc'
'\!', '\*', '\{', '\\' : Escape
The Escape option allows you to filter text with special characters (including the special characters used as filters). You must prefix the special character with a backward slash (\). For example, if you want to view the authentication records of users with identity "Employee!," enter "Employee\!" in the Identity Filter field. In this example, Cisco ISE considers the exclamation mark (!) as a literal character and not as a special character.
In addition, the Status field allows you to filter only passed authentication records, failed authentications, live sessions, and so on. The green check mark filters all the passed authentications that occurred in the past. The red cross mark filters all failed authentications. The blue i icon filters all the live sessions. You can also choose to view a combination of these options.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Operations > RADIUS > Live Logs.
Step 2
Filter data based on any of the fields in the Show Live Authentications window.
You can filter the results based on passed or failed authentications, or live sessions.
Global Search for Endpoints
You can use the global search box available at the top of the Cisco ISE home page to search for endpoints. You can use any of the following criteria to search for an endpoint:
User name
MAC Address
IP Address
Authorization Profile
Endpoint Profile
Failure Reason
Identity Group
Identity Store
Network Device name
Network Device Type
Operating System
Posture Status
Location
Security Group
User Type
You should enter at least three characters for any of the search criteria in the Search field to display data.

Note
If an endpoint has been authenticated by Cisco ISE, or its accounting update has been received, it can be found through the global search. Endpoints that have been manually added and are not authenticated by or accounted for in Cisco ISE will not show up in the search results.
The search result provides a detailed and at-a-glance information about the current status of the endpoint, which you can use for troubleshooting. Search results display only the top 25 entries. You can use filters to narrow down the results.
The following figure shows an example of the search result.
Figure 1. Search Result For Endpoints
You can use any of the properties in the left panel to filter the results. You can also click on any endpoint to see more detailed information about the endpoint, such as:

You can configure the list of attributes and their values to be used in a test case. These details are used to perform interactions with the Policy system to simulate the run-time invocation of the policy.
The attributes can be configured by using dictionaries. All the dictionaries that are applicable to Simple RADIUS authentication are listed in the Attributes field.

Note
You can configure test cases only for Simple RADIUS authentication.

You can select an entry on the Live Logs window and click the Actions icon (in the Details column) to launch the Session Trace Test Case tool. Cisco ISE extracts the relevant attributes and their values from the corresponding log entry. You can modify these attributes and values, if required, and execute the test case.
Technical Support Tunnel for Advanced Troubleshooting
Cisco ISE uses the Cisco IronPort Tunnel infrastructure to create a secure tunnel for Cisco technical support engineers to connect to an ISE server and troubleshoot issues with the system. Cisco ISE uses SSH to create the secure connection through the tunnel.
As an administrator, you can control the tunnel access—you can choose when and how long to grant access to a support engineer. Cisco Customer Support cannot establish the tunnel without your intervention. You will receive notifications about the service logins. You can disable the tunnel connection at any point of time. By default, the technical support tunnel remains open for 72 hours. However, we recommend that you or the support engineer close the tunnel after all the troubleshooting work is complete. Note that you can choose to extend the tunnel beyond 72 hours, if needed.
Use the tech support-tunnel enable command to initiate a tunnel connection.
The tech support-tunnel status command displays the status of the connection. This command provides information on whether the connection is established or not, if there is an authentication failure, or if the servers are unreachable. If the tunnel server is reachable, but ISE is unable to authenticate, ISE tries to authenticate again every five minutes for a period of 30 minutes, after which the tunnel is disabled.
You can disable the tunnel connection using the tech support-tunnel disable command. This command disconnects an existing tunnel even if a support engineer is currently logged in.
If you have already established a tunnel connection from an ISE server, the SSH keys that are generated are available on the ISE server. When you try to enable the support tunnel at a later point of time, the system prompts you about reusing the SSH keys generated earlier. You can choose to use the same keys or generate new keys. You can also manually reset the keys using the tech support-tunnel resetkey command. If you execute this command when a tunnel connection is enabled, the system prompts you to disable the connection first. If you choose to continue with the existing connection and not disable the connection the keys are reset after the existing connection is disabled. If you choose to disable the connection, the tunnel connection is dropped and the keys are reset immediately.
After you establish a tunnel connection, you can extend it using the tech support-tunnel extend command.
See the Cisco Identity Services Engine CLI Reference Guide for usage guidelines about the tech support-tunnel command.
Establish a Technical Support Tunnel
Establish a Technical Support Tunnel
You can establish a secure tunnel through the Cisco ISE CLI.
Procedure
Step 1
Enter the following command from the Cisco ISE CLI:
tech support-tunnel enable
The system prompts you for a password and a nickname for the tunnel.
Step 2
Enter the password.
Step 3
(Optional) Enter a nickname for the tunnel.
The system generates an SSH key and displays the password, device serial number, and the SSH key.
Step 4
Copy the password, device serial number, and SSH key and send it to Cisco Customer Support.
The support engineer can now securely connect to your ISE server. You will receive periodic notifications about service logins.
TCP Dump Utility to Validate Incoming Traffic
The TCP Dump Utility sniffs packets that you can use to verify if the expected packet has reached a node. For example, when there is no incoming authentication or log indicated in the report, you may suspect that there is no incoming traffic, or that the incoming traffic cannot reach Cisco ISE. In such cases, you can run this tool to validate.
You can configure the TCP dump options and then collect data from the network traffic to help you troubleshoot a network issue.

Caution
Starting a TCP Dump automatically deletes a previous dump file. To save a previous dump file, perform the task, as described in the Saving a TCP Dump File section before you begin a new TCP Dump session.

Cisco ISE Support Bundle
You can configure the logs that you want to be a part of your support bundle. For example, you can configure logs from a particular service to be a part of your debug logs. You can also filter the logs based on dates.
The logs that you can download are categorized as follows:
Full configuration database: Contains the Cisco ISE configuration database in a human-readable XML format. When you troubleshoot issues, you can import this database configuration into another Cisco ISE node to re-create the scenario.
Debug logs: Captures bootstrap, application configuration, run-time, deployment, public key infrastructure (PKI) information, and monitoring and reporting.
Debug logs provide troubleshooting information for specific Cisco ISE components. To enable debug logs, see chapter 11 on Logging. If you do not enable the debug logs, all the informational messages (INFO) will be included in the support bundle. For more information, see Cisco ISE Debug Logs.
Local logs: Contains syslog messages from the various processes that run on Cisco ISE.
Core files: Contains critical information that helps identify the cause of a crash. These logs are created when the application crashes, and includes heap dumps.
Monitoring and reporting logs: Contains information about alerts and reports.
System logs: Contains Cisco Application Deployment Engine-related (ADE-related) information.
Policy configuration: Contains policies configured in Cisco ISE in human-readable format.
You can download these logs from the Cisco ISE CLI by using the backup-logs command. For more information, see the Cisco Identity Services Engine CLI Reference Guide.

Note
For Inline Posture node, you cannot download the support bundle from the Admin portal. You must use the backup-logs command from the Cisco ISE CLI.
If you choose to download these logs from the Admin portal, you can do the following:
Download only a subset of logs based on the log type, such as debug logs or system logs.

Monitoring Database
The rate and amount of data that is utilized by the monitoring functions requires a separate database on a dedicated node that is used for these purposes.
Like PSN, the MnT node has a dedicated database that requires you to perform maintenance tasks, as described in the topics covered in this section.

Back Up and Restore the Monitoring Database
The Monitoring database handles large volumes of data. Over time, the performance and efficiency of the MnT node depends on how well you manage that data. To increase efficiency, we recommend that you back up the data and transfer it to a remote repository on a regular basis. You can automate this task by scheduling automatic backups.

Note
You should not perform a backup when a purge operation is in progress. If you start a backup during a purge operation, the purge operation stops or fails.
If you register a secondary MnT node, we recommend that you first back up the primary MnT node and then restore the data to the new secondary MnT node. This ensures that the history of the primary MnT node is in sync with the new secondary node when the new changes are replicated.
Monitoring Database Purge
The purging process allows you to manage the size of the Monitoring database by specifying the number of months to retain the data during a purge. The default is three months. This value is utilized when the disk space usage threshold for purging (80 percentage of the total disk space) is met. For this option, each month consists of 30 days. A default of three months equals 90 days.
Related References
Guidelines for Purging the Monitoring Database
Guidelines for Purging the Monitoring Database
Follow these guidelines for optimal relating to Monitoring database disk usage:
If the Monitoring database disk usage is greater than 80 percentage of the threshold setting, that is 60% of total disk space, a critical alarm is generated, indicating that the database size is about to exceed the maximum amount of allocated disk size. If the disk usage is greater than 90 percentage of the threshold setting, that is 70% of total disk space, another alarm is generated, indicating that the database size has exceeded the maximum amount of allocated disk size.
A purge process runs, creating a status history report that you can view in the Data Purging Audit window. The navigation path to this window is Operations > Reports > Reports > Audit > Data Purging Audit. An information (INFO) alarm is generated after the purge is completed.
Purging is also based on the percentage of consumed disk space for the database. When the consumed disk space for the Monitoring database is equal to or exceeds the threshold (the default is 80 percentage of the total disk space), the purge process starts. This process deletes only the oldest seven days' monitoring data, irrespective of what is configured in the Admin portal. It will continue this process in a loop until the disk space is below 80 percent. Purging always checks the Monitoring database disk space limit before proceeding.
Operational Data Purging
Cisco ISE Monitoring Operational database contains information that is generated as Cisco ISE reports. Recent Cisco ISE releases have options to purge the monitoring operational data and reset the monitoring database after running the Cisco ISE admin application configure ise. CLI command.
The purge option is used to clean up the data and prompts you to enter the number of days for which to retain the data. The reset option is used to reset the database to the factory default, so that all the data that is backed up will be permanently deleted. Specify the database if the files are consuming too much file system space.

Note
The reset option will cause Cisco ISE services to be temporarily unavailable until it restarts.
The Operational Data Purging window contains the Database Utilization and Purge Data Now areas. The navigation path for this window is Administration > System > Maintenance > Operational Data Purging. You can view the total available database space and the RADIUS and TACACS data stored in the Database Utilization area. Hover the mouse over the status bar to display the available disk space and the number of days the existing data is stored in the database. Specify the period for which the RADIUS and TACACS data is supposed to be retained in the Data Retention Period area. Data is purged at 4 a.m. very day, and you can configure to export data to a repository before it is purged, by specifying the number of retention days. Check the Enable Export Repository check box to select and create a repository, and specify an Encryption Key.
In the Purge Data Now area, you can purge all the RADIUS and TACACS data or specify the number of days beyond which data is supposed to be purged.

Note
You must export RADIUS authentication and accounting, TACACS authorization and accounting, RADIUS errors, and misconfigured supplicants tables to a repository before purging.
Related Tasks
Purge Older Operational Data
Purge Older Operational Data
The operational data is collected in the server over a period of time. It can be purged either instantly or periodically. You can verify the success of the data purge by viewing the Data Purging Audit report.
Before you begin
To perform the following task, you must be a Super Admin or System Admin.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Administration > System > Maintenance > Operational Data Purging.
Step 2
Do one of the following:
In the Data Retention Period area:
Specify the time period, in days, for which RADIUS and TACACS data should be retained. All the data prior to the specified time period is exported to a repository.
In the Repository area, check the Enable Export Repository check box to choose the repository to save data.
In the Encryption Key field, enter the required password.
Click Save.
Note 
If the configured retention period is less than the existing retention thresholds corresponding to the diagnostics data, then the configured value overrides the existing threshold values. For example, if you configure the retention period as three day,s and this value is less than the existing thresholds in the diagnostics tables (for example, a default of five days), then the data is purged according to the value that you configure (three days) in this window.
In the Purge Data Now area:
Choose to purge all the data or to purge the data that is older than the specified number of days. Data is not saved in any repository.
Click Purge.
Database Crash or File Corruption Issues
Cisco ISE may crash if the oracle database files are corrupted due to power outage or other reasons resulting in data loss. Based on the incident, follow the instructions below to recover from data loss.
In case of PAN corruption in deployment, you should promote the Secondary PAN to Primary PAN.
If the secondary PAN's promotion is not possible due to a small deployment or any other reason, restore the most recent available backup as described in Cisco Identity Services Engine CLI Reference Guide.
In case of PSN corruption, follow the steps to de-register, reset config, and register as described in the Cisco Identity Services Engine CLI Reference Guide.
In case of a standalone device, restore the most recent available backup as described in Cisco Identity Services Engine CLI Reference Guide.

Note
Obtain the backup from the standalone device regularly to avoid loss in the latest configuration changes.
