Objective
The Cisco FindIT Network Management application provides tools that help you monitor and manage your Cisco 100 to 500 Series devices on the network conveniently through your web browser. When deployed properly, it automatically discovers your network, and allows you to configure and monitor devices such as Cisco switches, routers, and wireless access points connected to your network. It also prompts you of firmware updates, as well as device warranty, and support contract coverage.
This article aims to show you the system requirements for the FindIT Network Manager and the FindIT Network Probe.
