From the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal menu, choose Manage Roles.

For each of your virtual accounts, assign a role from the following list:
Monitor: Allows you to view and monitor all the overlay options in the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal.
Overlay Management: Allows you to create, modify, and monitor overlay networks.
Administration: Allows you to perform all the tasks defined by the monitor and overlay network roles, and to onboard a secondary IdP.
Click Add Role.
After adding all the roles, click Done.
Log in to the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal again using your IdP credentials.
Create Additional Roles
To create an additional role, the Smart Account administrator should follow the same procedure as described in the Configure Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal Roles for IdP Users section.
