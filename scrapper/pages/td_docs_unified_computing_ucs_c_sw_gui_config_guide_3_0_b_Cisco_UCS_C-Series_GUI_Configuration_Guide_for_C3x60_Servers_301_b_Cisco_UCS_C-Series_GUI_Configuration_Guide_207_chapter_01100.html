Chapter Contents
This chapter includes the following sections:
Managing the Server Certificate
Generating a Certificate Signing Request
Creating a Self-Signed Certificate
Creating a Self-Signed Certificate Using Windows
Uploading a Server Certificate
Key Management Interoperability Protocol
Managing the Server Certificate
You can generate a certificate signing request (CSR) to obtain a new certificate, and you can upload the new certificate to the Cisco IMC to replace the current server certificate. The server certificate may be signed either by a public Certificate Authority (CA), such as Verisign, or by your own certificate authority. The generated certificate key length is 2048 bits.

Note
Before performing any of the following tasks in this chapter, ensure that the Cisco IMC time is set to the current time.
Procedure
Step 1
Generate the CSR from the Cisco IMC.
Step 2
Submit the CSR file to a certificate authority that will issue and sign your certificate. If your organization generates its own self-signed certificates, you can use the CSR file to generate a self-signed certificate.
Step 3
Upload the new certificate to the Cisco IMC.
Note 
The uploaded certificate must be created from a CSR generated by the Cisco IMC. Do not upload a certificate that was not created by this method.
Generating a Certificate Signing Request

Note
Do not use special characters (For example ampersand (&)) in the Common Name and Organization Unit fields.
Before you begin
You must log in as a user with admin privileges to configure certificates.
Ensure that the Cisco IMC time is set to the current time.
Procedure
Step 1
In the Navigation pane, click the Admin menu.
Step 2
In the Admin menu, click Security Management.
Step 3
In the Actions area, click the Generate New Certificate Signing Request link.
The Generate New Certificate Signing Request dialog box appears.
Step 4
In the Generate New Certificate Signing Request dialog box, update the following properties:
Name Description
Common Name field
The fully qualified name of the Cisco IMC.
By default the CN of the servers appears in CXXX-YYYYYY format, where XXX is the model number and YYYYYY is the serial number of the server.
When you upgrade to latest version, CN is retained as is.
Subject Alternate Name (SAN)
You can now provide additional input parameter for Subject Alternate Name. This allows various values to be associated using the subject field of the certificate.
The various options of SAN includes:
Email
DNS name
IP address
Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
Note 
This field is optional. You can configure any number of SAN instances of each type, but all together the instances count must not exceed 10.
Organization Name field
The organization requesting the certificate.
Organization Unit field
The organizational unit.
Locality field
The city or town in which the company requesting the certificate is headquartered.
State Name field
The state or province in which the company requesting the certificate is headquartered.
Country Code drop-down list
The country in which the company resides.
Email field
The email contact at the company.
Signature Algorithm
Allows you to select the signature algorithm for generating certificate signing request. This can be one of the following:
SHA384
SHA1
SHA256
SHA512
The default signature algorithm selected for generating certificate signing request is SHA384.
Self Signed Certificate check box
Generates a Self Signed Certificate.
Warning 
After successful certificate generation, the Cisco IMC Web GUI restarts. Communication with the management controller may be lost momentarily and you will need to re-login.
Note 
If enabled, CSR is generated, signed and uploaded automatically.
Note 
If Self-signed certificate is enabled, ignore steps 5 and 6.
Step 5
Click Generate CSR.
The Opening csr.txt dialog box appears.
Step 6
Perform any one of the following steps to manage the CSR file, csr.txt:
Click Open With to view csr.txt.
Click Save File and then click OK to save csr.txt to your local machine.
What to do next
Submit the CSR file to a certificate authority that will issue and sign your certificate. If your organization generates its own self-signed certificates, you can use the CSR file to generate a self-signed certificate.
Ensure that the certificate is of type Server.
Creating a Self-Signed Certificate
As an alternative to using a public Certificate Authority (CA) to generate and sign a server certificate, you can operate your own CA and sign your own certificates. This section shows commands for creating a CA and generating a server certificate using the OpenSSL certificate server running on Linux. For detailed information about OpenSSL, see http://www.openssl.org.

Note
These commands are to be entered on a Linux server with the OpenSSL package, not in the Cisco IMC.
Before you begin
Obtain and install a certificate server software package on a server within your organization.
Ensure that the Cisco IMC time is set to the current time.
Procedure
  Command or Action Purpose
Step 1
openssl genrsa -out CA_keyfilename keysize
Example:
# openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048
This command generates an RSA private key that will be used by the CA.
Note 
To allow the CA to access the key without user input, do not use the -des3 option for this command.
The specified file name contains an RSA key of the specified key size.
Step 2
openssl req -new -x509 -days numdays -key CA_keyfilename -out CA_certfilename
Example:
# openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca.key -out ca.crt
This command generates a new self-signed certificate for the CA using the specified key. The certificate is valid for the specified period. The command prompts the user for additional certificate information.
The certificate server is an active CA.
Step 3
echo "nsCertType = server" > openssl.conf
Example:
# echo "nsCertType = server" > openssl.conf
This command adds a line to the OpenSSL configuration file to designate the certificate as a server-only certificate. This designation is a defense against a man-in-the-middle attack, in which an authorized client attempts to impersonate the server.
The OpenSSL configuration file openssl.conf contains the statement "nsCertType = server".
Step 4
openssl x509 -req -days numdays -in CSR_filename -CA CA_certfilename -set_serial 04 -CAkey CA_keyfilename -out server_certfilename -extfile openssl.conf
Example:
# openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in csr.txt -CA ca.crt -set_serial 04
-CAkey ca.key -out myserver05.crt -extfile openssl.conf
This command directs the CA to use your CSR file to generate a server certificate.
Your server certificate is contained in the output file.
Step 5
openssl x509 -noout -text -purpose -in <cert file>
Example:
openssl x509 -noout -text -purpose -in <cert file>
Verifies if the generated certificate is of type Server.
Note 
If the values of the fields Server SSL and Netscape SSL server are not yes, ensure that openssl.conf is configured to generate certificates of type server.
Step 6
(Optional) If the generated certificate does not have the correct validity dates, ensure the Cisco IMC time is set to the current time, and regenerate the certificate by repeating steps 1 through 5.
(Optional)
Certificate with the correct validity dates is created.
Example
This example shows how to create a CA and to generate a server certificate signed by the new CA. These commands are entered on a Linux server running OpenSSL.
# /usr/bin/openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
.............++++++
.....++++++
e is 65537 (0x10001)
# /usr/bin/openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca.key -out ca.crt
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [GB]:US
State or Province Name (full name) [Berkshire]:California

Key Management Interoperability Protocol
Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) is a communication protocol that defines message formats to handle keys or classified data on a key management server. KMIP is an open standard and is supported by several vendors. Key management involves multiple interoperable implementations, so a KMIP client works effectively with any KMIP server.

Note
The KMIP feature is supported only on the C220 M4, C240 M4 and S3260 M4 servers.
Self-Encrypting Drives(SEDs) contain hardware that encrypts incoming data and decrypts outgoing data in realtime. A drive or media encryption key controls this function. However, the drives need to be locked in order to maintain security. A security key identifier and a security key (key encryption key) help achieve this goal. The key identifier provides a unique ID to the drive.
Different keys have different usage requirements. Currently, the responsibility of managing and tracking local keys lies primarily with the user, which could result in human error. The user needs to remember the different keys and their functions, which could prove to be a challenge. KMIP addresses this area of concern to manage the keys effectively without human involvement.
