Advisory Regarding Cisco bug ID CSCwd46600
Advisory for 20.6.x Release Train (Revised 15 May, 0800 UTC)
Introduction
This document describes how to identify a vEdge with an expired certificate that can affect control connections, and data plane connections, and result in loss of service.
Background Information
This issue impacts vEdge 100M, vEdge 100WM,  vEdge 100B, vEdge 1000, and vEdge 2000 platforms.  This is caused by a public root certificate that expired on May 9th, 2023 at 6:57 AM UTC.
Note: This incident does not impact these platforms:
1. vEdge Cloud, vEdge 5000, and ISR 1100 running Viptela OS
2. Cisco routing platforms (physical as well as virtual) running XE SD-WAN software

In case the device got reloaded after the 'hour X' (that is 6:57 AM UTC May 9th, 2023) additionally this is seen:
serial-num BOARD-ID-NOT-INITIALISED
Caution: This issue is applicable when the Hardware WAN Edge Certificate Authorization is set to either Enterprise Certificates or Onbox Certificates in vManage.
These conditions can result in an impact on the vEdge:
Loss of connections to vSmart
Loss of connections to vManage
Port-Hop 
Control policy changes such as topology changes in the network
Clear control connection
Interface Flaps
Device Reload
Note: During the Control Connection establishment, the Onbox certificate is validated by the controllers in all cases. When Enterprise Certificates are used, both the Onbox and Enterprise Certificates are validated.
Note: For more information about this behavior, reference Cisco bug ID CSCwf28118.
Precautions to Avoid Service Disruption
In order to prevent a complete loss of service, AVOID these actions in this section.
Reload the device
Update policy
Template pushes
Caution:  Device reload causes the Graceful Restart Timers to reset and the router is not able to reconnect to the fabric. Without a reload, the Data Plane (BFD) Sessions remain up and traffic is able to pass until the Graceful Restart timer is expired, even while control connections are down.
Remediation Process
Cisco has published upgrade versions of software to permanently resolve this problem. Carefully read the entire process before you take any action. 
The high-level process to remedy this problem is:
Execute pre-checks to prepare for the upgrade of your Controller(s)
Upgrade the SD-WAN controller(s) to a fixed version
Restore control and BFD connections between vEdge and controllers 
Execute pre-checks to prepare to upgrade your vEdge software
Upgrade vEdge software to a fixed version
Post-Upgrade Considerations
Three scenarios are referenced here. The steps for remediation vary based on which scenario applies to each vEdge in your network.
Scenario 1: vEdge Control Connection is UP and the vEdge HAS NOT been rebooted.
Scenario 2: vEdge Control Connection is DOWN and the vEdge HAS NOT been rebooted.
Scenario 3: vEdge Control Connection is DOWN and the vEdge HAS been rebooted. 
Fixed Software Versions
Cisco continues to work to build and validate fixed software versions as quickly as possible. This page is updated as new versions are validated and posted to Cisco.com. 
Tip: Use the 'My Notifications' feature found on the Software Downloads page on Cisco.com to be notified when new software is available for any Cisco product you are interested in.
Use the table shown to determine which version you can upgrade to based on your current version. It is possible more than one upgrade path is supported.
More versions are added as they are available. If your version is not listed in the Current Version column there is no upgrade path available at this time.
Tip: It is advisable to stage software images prior to the scheduled Maintenance Window. Use Install to stage the images prior to the window. Do not check the box Activate and Reboot during this process otherwise, the device completes the upgrade immediately after the completion of the install. This ensures a shorter Maintenance Window.
Note: In order to ensure the integrity of an image at Cisco, customers can pursue a common best practice to verify it with the SHA checksum provided for the image. Cisco offers a Bulk Hash file as a helpful tool for customers to re-verify downloaded images from the Cisco Software Downloads page. For more detailed information, visit https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/downloads.html.
Upgrade Recommendation Matrix
The software versions in the table shown are recommended based on the fix for the expired certificate issue. Upgrades outside of the scope of this issue must only be done with the instructions in the product documentation and the Release Notes for Cisco SD-WAN based on the version you upgrade to.
Note: Cisco strongly recommends that you stay within your current release train to mitigate the impact on production due to the certification expiry issue. For example, If you are currently on 20.3.2, upgrade to 20.3.7.1.
Upgrading vEdge 5000, vEdge Cloud, and ISR 1100 is not currently necessary as they are not impacted, by Cisco bug ID CSCwf28118.

Pre-checks to Be Performed Prior to a Controller Upgrade
Backup your Controller
If cloud-hosted, confirm the latest backup is done or initiate a backup of config db as mentioned in the next step.
You can view the current backups as well as trigger an on-demand snapshot from the SSP portal.  Find more guidance here.
If on-prem, take a config-db backup and VM snapshot of the controllers.
vManage# request nms configuration-db backup path /home/admin/db_backup
successfully saved the database to /home/admin/db_backup.tar.gz
If on-prem, collect the show running-config and save this locally.
If on-prem, ensure you know your neo4j password and notate to your exact current version. 
Run an AURA Check
Download and adhere to the steps in order to run AURA from CiscoDevNet/sure: SD-WAN Upgrade Readiness Experience
Open to a TAC SR in order to address any questions related to the failed checks in the AURA report.
Ensure Send to Controllers/Send to vBond is Done
Check vManage Statistics Collection Interval
Cisco recommends the Statistics Collection Interval in Administration > Settings is set to the default timer of 30 minutes.
Note: Cisco recommends that your vSmarts and vBonds be attached to the vManage template before an upgrade.
Verify Disk Space on vSmart and vBond
Use the command df -kh | grep boot from vShell to determine the size of the disk.
controller:~$ df -kh | grep boot
/dev/sda1       2.5G  232M  2.3G  10% /boot
controller:~$
If the size is greater than 200 MB, proceed with the upgrade of the controllers. 
If the size is less than 200 MB, pursue these steps:
1. Verify the current version is the only one listed under show software command.

4. Check the disk space in order to ensure it is greater than 200 MB.  If it is not, open a TAC SR. 
Upgrade your Controllers
This is a summary of the next steps which are done for each of these customers.
Caution: Confirm all prechecks are done and backups taken as described in the previous section.
Upload the new software version to the upgrade repository.
Ensure the controller image with the fix for this problem is selected.
Upgrade the controllers with the image fix in this sequence.
1. vManage
2. vBond
3. vSmart
Note: If you proceed with the controllers upgrade by CLI, remember to perform 'request software upgrade-confirm'.
vManage Standalone Upgrade
In the case of standalone vManage, these steps must be pursued:
Copy the image to vManage Maintenance> Software repository
Upgrade with vManage Maintenance>Software upgrade
Click Upgrade, and wait for the upgrade to complete
Navigate back to the same page, click the vManage, and then click Activate
Note: The vManage upgrade has no impact on the data network.
vManage Cluster Upgrade
In the case of cluster upgrade, the steps mentioned in the Cisco SD-WAN Getting Started Guide - Cluster Management [Cisco SD-WAN] - Cisco guide must be pursued. 
Note: The vManage cluster upgrade has no impact on the data network.
Caution: If you have any questions or issues when you upgrade your cluster, contact TAC before you proceed.
vBond Upgrade
A vBond upgrade uses the same process as a vManage upgrade.
Warning: vBonds must be upgraded sequentially. Verify the upgrade has been completed on each vBond before you move to the next.
Copy the image to vManage Maintenance > Software repository
Upgrade with vManage Maintenance > Software upgrade
Click Upgrade, and wait for the upgrade to complete
Navigate back to the same page, click vManage, and then click Activate
Verify with the command show orchestrator connections on the vBond
Verify with the command show control connections on the vManage
vSmart Upgrade
A vSmart upgrade uses the same process as a vManage upgrade.
Warning: vSmarts must be upgraded sequentially. Verify the upgrade has been completed on each vSmart before you move to the next.
Copy the image to vManage Maintenance > Software repository
Upgrade the vSmart from the vManage UI Maintenance > Software upgrade
Click Upgrade and wait for the upgrade to complete
Navigate back to the same page. Choose the vSmart then click Activate
Verify sessions have been restored after the upgrade with the command show control connections on the vSmart
Note: When the vSmart reboots during a software upgrade, devices run into graceful restart with no network impact.
Verify Control Connections are Established After all Controller Upgrades
For all vEdge in Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 after the Controller(s) have been upgraded both Control and BFD connections must be restored.
Upgrade vEdge
Note: vEdge upgrade is the last step of the procedure to completely protect against the power cycle of the vEdge routers, described in Scenario 3.
Note: It is advisable to stage vEdge software images prior to the scheduled Maintenance Window. Use Install to stage the images prior to the window. Do not check the box Activate and Reboot during this process otherwise, the device completes the upgrade immediately after the completion of the install. This ensures a shorter Maintenance Window.
You can load the images to multiple vEdges at one go from vManage via:
1. Navigate to the vManage UI. Navigate to Maintenance > Software Repository. Load the vEdge image. You can then navigate to Maintenance > Software Upgrade and click Upgrade after you choose the devices that need the upgrade.
2. Navigate to the vManage UI. Navigate to Maintenance > Software Repository. Click Add new software. Click Remote server. Enter the controller version, the vEdge version, and the complete path to the FTP/HTTP URL where the image is stored. For example, ftp://<username>:<password>@<FTP server>/<path>/<image name>. You can then navigate to Maintenance > Software Upgrade and click Upgrade after you choose the devices that need the upgrade with the use of the Remote server option.
Note: Choose vEdges in batches based on the bandwidth in order to push the image.
Prechecks Before vEdge Upgrade 
Caution: If these prechecks are skipped, the vEdge upgrade can fail due to insufficient disk space.
1. Verify the current version is the only one listed under show software command.

vEdge Upgrade Scenario 1: Control Connection is UP and vEdge HAS NOT Been Rebooted
After controllers are upgraded to a version with the fix, vEdge devices that have not been rebooted re-establish connectivity automatically.
Important: An upgrade is required on vEdge devices in this state. It MUST be prioritized and planned as soon as possible. If needed, perform during off-business hours as quickly as possible. Plan an upgrade of the device in order to avoid control and data plane impact due to any reboot or power cycle of the device. The device must not be rebooted prior to the upgrade.
In order to upgrade the vEdge, pursue the steps indicated:
Copy the new vEdge software to the vManage via Maintenance > Software repository
Upgrade the vEdge from the vManage Maintenance > Software upgrade
ClickUpgradeand wait for the upgrade to complete
Navigate back to the same page. Choose the vEdge and then clickActivate

vEdge Upgrade Scenario 2: Control Connection is Down and vEdge HAS NOT Rebooted
After controllers are upgraded to a version with the fix, vEdge devices that have not been rebooted re-establish connectivity automatically.
Important: An upgrade is required on vEdge devices in this state. It MUST be prioritized and planned as soon as possible. If needed, perform during off-business hours as quickly as possible.  Plan an upgrade of the device in order to avoid control and data plane impact due to any reboot or power cycle of the device. The device must not be rebooted prior to the upgrade.
In order to upgrade the vEdge, pursue the steps indicated:
Copy the new vEdge software to the vManage via Maintenance > Software repository
Upgrade the vEdge from the vManage Maintenance > Software upgrade
ClickUpgradeand wait for the upgrade to complete
Navigate back to the same page. Choose the vEdge and then clickActivate

Scenario 3: vEdge, Control Connection is Down, the Device Rebooted/Power Cycled
Caution: To recover these devices, out-of-band access is required. 
This output shows a vEdge device that has been rebooted after the certificate expired. Use the command show control local-properties | inc serial and confirm the output shows BOARD-ID-NOT-INITIALISED.
vedge# show control local-properties | inc serial
serial-num                        BOARD-ID-NOT-INITIALISED
subject-serial-num                N/A
enterprise-serial-num             No certificate installed
vedge#
Change the Date/Time on vEdge to restore Control Connections
These steps require out-of-band access to the vEdge device such as console or direct SSH.
Roll back the clock to May 5th, 2023 (for example #clock set date 2023-05-05 time 15:49:00.000) on vEdge which has a control connection DOWN.
vedge# clock set date 2023-05-05 time 10:23:00
vedge# show clock
Mon May 5 10:23:37 UTC 2023
vedge#
Wait 2-3 minutes for the board-id to initialize. Check show control local-properties in order to ensure the device now has a number shown in the output. 
vedge# show control local-properties | inc serial
serial-num                        10024640
subject-serial-num                N/A
enterprise-serial-num             No certificate installed
vedge#
(Optional) If the board-id initialization does not happen within 2-3 minutes, reload vEdge and check the show control local-properties output in order to ensure the device now has its serial number listed in the output
Once the board-id has initialized validate the certificate with the command show certificate validity
vedge# show certificate validity 
The certificate issued by c33d2cf4-e586-4df4-ac72-298422644ba3 is valid from Sep 7 02:50:16 2021 GMT (Current date is Mon May 1 10:25:03 GMT 2023) & valid until Sep 5 02:50:16 2031 GMT
vedge#
Once control connections have been successfully recovered, correct the clock to the current time with a YYYY-MM-DD and HH:MM::SS format for the date and time.
This example is for illustration purposes only. Always set the date and time to the current time.
vedge# clock set date YYYY-MM-DD time HH:MM::SS
vedge# show clock
Wed May 10 10:23:37 UTC 2023
vedge#
Verify control connections are up with the command show control connections.
vedge# show control connections

Upgrade Procedure from 18.4, 19.x, and 20.1 (Revised 13 May, 0300 UTC) 
All upgrades from versions 18.4, 19.x, and 20.1.x must upgrade to version 20.3.7.1.
This section has been revised with instructions to upgrade vManage with boot disks smaller than 2.5G to 20.1.3.1 instead of 20.1.3.
The new 20.1.3.1 vManage software includes the updated certificates and allows devices to connect while the second upgrade to 20.3.7.1 is performed.
Caution: Read this section carefully before you proceed. Multiple upgrades can be required.
Pre-Upgrade Checks
Before you proceed with any upgrade, you must complete all of the pre-checks to help ensure the upgrade is successful. 
These pre-upgrade checks validate the size of the database, compute resources, and boot disk size.
Check Database Size via the CLI
Use the command request nms configuration-db diagnostic | i TotalStoreSize to obtain the size of the database in bytes.
From vshell execute the command expr <number of bytes> / 1024 / 1024 / 1024   to convert this output to an integer value in GB.
vmanage# request nms configuration-db diagnostics | i TotalStoreSize
| "StoreSizes"     | "TotalStoreSize"                     | 3488298345                |
vmanage1# vshell
vmanage1:~$ expr 348829834 / 1024 / 1024 / 1024
3
This example shows the database size is 3 GB.
STOP: If your database size is 5GB or greater  Open a TAC SR  for assistance with this upgrade.
If the database size is less than 5GB proceed with the upgrade.
Verify Compute Resources 
Ensure Compute resources are in line with the 20.3 Compute Resources Guide.
Check vCPU with the command lscpu | grep CPU\ MHz
vmanage1:~$ lscpu | grep CPU\ MHz
CPU MHz:                         2999.658
vmanage1:~$
Check Memory with the commands free -g | grep Mem and free --giga | grep Mem
vmanage1:~$ free -g | grep Mem
Mem:             31          21           7           0           2           9
vmanage1:~$ free --giga | grep Mem
Mem:             33          23           7           0           2           9
vmanage1:~$
Check Third Partition (/opt/data) size with the command df -kh
vmanage1:~$ df -kh | grep "/opt/data"
/dev/sdb        108G   24G   79G  23% /opt/data
vmanage1:~$
If compute resources are not in line with 20.3, increase the computing resources prior to the upgrade. 
Check Boot Disk Space with CLI
Use the command df -kh | grep boot from vShell in order to determine the size of the disk.
vmanage# vshell
vmanage:~$ df -kh | grep boot
/dev/sda1       5.0G  4.7G  343M  94% /boot
vmanage:~$
This example shows the /boot disk is 5.0G. 
Warning: If the vManage boot disk is less than 2.5G you must perform a step upgrade through version 20.1
Upgrade vManage on Versions 18.4 and 19.x
Perform the Upgrade - vManage Standalone
If the size of the boot disk is less than 2.5G you must upgrade vManage to version 20.1 before you proceed.
Download the 20.1.3.1 image from https://software.cisco.com/download/home/286320995/type/286321394/release/20.1.3.1
Pursue the steps in Upgrade your Controllers to complete the upgrade
If the disk size is 2.5G or greater you can upgrade to 20.3.7.1 directly.

Post-Upgrade Considerations
If configuration changes were made to increase graceful restart timers and IPSec rekey timers prior to the upgrade, it is recommended to roll the configurations back to the settings which were in place prior to the upgrade in order to avoid potential unnecessary impact.  
Special Advisory
Customers who have upgraded their controllers to versions earlier than 20.3.7.1 and are in the process to upgrade their vEdges can reach out to TAC for access to respective vEdge images.
Advisory Regarding Cisco bug ID CSCwd46600
Previous versions of this document recommended customers upgrade to several versions of 20.3.x (20.3.3.2, 20.3.5.1, 20.3.4.3, 20.3.7.1).
Cisco recommends that customers who run image 20.3.x, upgrade their controllers and vEdges to image 20.3.7.1.
Devices that run releases 19.x and 20.3.x earlier than 20.3.7.1, 20.4, and 20.6x release earlier than 20.6.5.1 can encounter Cisco bug ID CSCwd46600 post-upgrade. In order to temporarily resolve this issue, run either of these commands:
request security ipsec-rekey
or 
request port-hop color <color>
However, it is strongly recommended that the customers upgrade their controllers and vEdge devices to 20.3.7.1 or 20.6.5.1.
Customers that have completely upgraded all vEdge devices to a 20.3.x release prior to 20.3.7.1, 20.3.4.3, or a 20.6.x release prior to 20.6.5.1 based on previous guidance can choose to remain on this release if they have not been impacted by the bug. It is recommended to upgrade to 20.3.7.1 or 20.6.5.1 during a scheduled maintenance window at a later date.
Advisory for 20.6.x Release Train (Revised 15 May, 0800 UTC)
Previous versions of this document recommended customers upgrade to several versions of 20.6.x (20.6.3.2, 20.6.4.1, 20.6.5.2). 
Cisco recommends that customers who run image 20.6.x and have trackers configured on an interface upgrade their controllers and vEdges to image 20.6.5.2.
Devices with a tracker configured can encounter Cisco bug ID CSCvz44093 during the upgrade.  In order to avoid the impact of this bug you can remove the tracker configuration prior to the upgrade. 
It is strongly recommended that customers upgrade their controllers and vEdge devices to 20.6.5.2.
Customers that have completely upgraded all vEdge devices to 20.6.3.2 and 20.6.4.1 based on previous guidance can choose to remain on this release if they have not been impacted by the bug.
