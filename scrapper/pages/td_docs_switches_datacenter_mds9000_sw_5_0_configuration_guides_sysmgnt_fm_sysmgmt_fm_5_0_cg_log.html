About System Message Logging
With the system message logging software, you can save messages in a log file or direct the messages to other devices. By default, the switch logs normal but significant system messages to a log file and sends these messages to the system console. This feature provides you with the following capabilities:
•Provides logging information for monitoring and troubleshooting
•Allows you to select the types of captured logging information
•Allows you to select the destination server to forward the captured logging information properly configured system message logging server.
You can monitor system messages by clicking the Events tab on Fabric Manager or by choosing Logs > Events >  Current on Device Manager. You can also monitor system messages remotely by accessing the switch through Telnet, SSH, or the console port, or by viewing the logs on a system message logging server.
Note When the switch first initializes, the network is not connected until initialization completes. Therefore, messages are not redirected to a system message logging server for a few seconds.
Log messages are not saved across system reboots. However, a maximum of 100 log messages with a severity level of critical and below (levels 0, 1, and 2) are saved in NVRAM.
Table 3-1 describes some samples of the facilities supported by the system message logs.

SFP Diagnostics
The error message related to SFP failures is written to the syslog. You can listen to the syslog for events related to SFP failures. The values, low or high alarm, andthe warning are checked for the following parameters:
•TX Power
•RX Power
•Temperature
•Voltage
•Current
The SFP notification trap indicates the current status of the alarm and warning monitoring parameters for all the sensors based on the digital diagnostic monitoring information. This notification is generated whenever there is a change in the status of atleast one of the monitoring parameters of the sensors on the transceiver in an interface.
The CISCO-INTERFACE-XCVR-MONITOR-MIB contains the SFP notification trap information. Refer to the Cisco MDS 9000 Family MIB Quick Reference for more information on this MIB.
System Message Logging Configuration
System logging messages are sent to the console based on the default (or configured) logging facility and severity values.
This sections includes the following topics:
•Message Logging Initiation
•Console Severity Level
•Module Logging
•Log Files
•System Message Logging Servers
•Verifying Syslog Servers from Fabric Manager Web Server
•Viewing Logs from Fabric Manager Web Server
Message Logging Initiation
You can disable logging to the console or enable logging to a specific Telnet or SSH session.
•When you disable or enable logging to a console session, that state is applied to all future console sessions. If you exit and log in again to a new session, the state is preserved.
•When you enable or disable logging to a Telnet or SSH session, that state is applied only to that session. If you exit and log in again to a new session, the state is not preserved.
To enable or disable the logging state for a Telnet or SSH session using Fabric Manager, follow these steps:
Step 1 Select a switch in the Fabric pane.
Step 2 Expand Switches, expand Events and select SysLog in the Physical Attributes pane.
You see the syslog information in the Information pane.
Step 3 Click the Switch Logging tab.
You see the switch information (see Figure 3-1).
Figure 3-1 Switch Logging Tab in Fabric Manager
Step 4 Select a switch in the Information pane.
Step 5 Check (enable) or uncheck (disable) the Console Enable check box.
Step 6 Click the Apply Changes icon.
Console Severity Level
When logging is enabled for a console session (default), you can configure the severity levels of messages that appear on the console. The default severity for console logging is 2 (critical).
Tip The current critical (default) logging level is maintained if the console baud speed is 9600 baud (default). All attempts to change the console logging level generates an error message. To increase the logging level (above critical), you must change the console baud speed to 38400 baud.
Monitor Severity Level
When logging is enabled for a monitor session (default), you can configure the severity levels of messages that appear on the monitor. The default severity for monitor logging is 5 (notifications).
To configure the severity level for a logging facility using Fabric Manager, follow these steps
Step 1 Select a switch in the Fabric pane.
Step 2 Expand Switches, expand Events and select SysLog in the Physical Attributes pane.
You see the syslog information in the Information pane.
Step 3 Click the Switch Logging tab.
You see the switch information (see Figure 3-2).
Figure 3-2 Switch Logging Tab in Fabric Manager
Step 4 Select a switch in the Information pane.
Step 5 Select a severity level from the Console Severity drop-down list in the row for that switch.
Step 6 Click the Apply Changes icon.
Module Logging
By default, logging is enabled at level 7 for all modules. You can enable or disable logging for each module at a specified level.
To the severity level for a logging facility, follow these steps:
Step 1 In Fabric Manager, expand Switches, expand Events and select SysLog in the Physical Attributes pane.
In Device Manager, choose Logs > Syslog > Setup and click the Switch Logging tab in the syslog dialog box.
You see the switch information (see Figure 3-3 or Figure 3-4).
Figure 3-3 Switch Logging Tab in Fabric Manager
Figure 3-4 Switch Logging Tab in Device Manager
Step 2 Check the check boxes where you want message logging to occur (ConsoleEnable, TerminalEnable, LineCardEnable).
Step 3 Choose the message severity threshold from the Console Severity drop-down box for each switch in Fabric Manager (see Figure 3-3) or click the appropriate message severity level radio button in Device Manager (see Figure 3-4).
Step 4 Click the Apply Changes icon in Fabric Manager, or click Apply in Device Manager to save and apply your changes.
Log Files
By default, the switch logs normal but significant system messages to a log file and sends these messages to the system console. Log messages are not saved across system reboots.The logging messages that are generated may be saved to a log file. You can configure the name of this file and restrict its size as required. The default log file name is messages. The file name can have up to 80 characters and the file size ranges from 4096 bytes to 4194304 bytes.
To send log messages to a file using Fabric Manager, follow these steps
Step 1 Select a switch in the Fabric pane.
Step 2 Expand Switches, expand Events and select SysLog in the Physical Attributes pane.
You see the syslog information in the Information pane.
Step 3 Select a switch in the Information pane.
Step 4 Click the Switch Logging tab.
You see the information in Figure 3-5.
Figure 3-5 Switch Logging Tab in Fabric Manager
Step 5 Enter the name of the log file in the LogFile Name column in the row for that switch.
Step 6 Click the Apply Changes icon.
Note The configured log file is saved in the /var/log/external directory. The location of the log file cannot be changed.
System Message Logging Servers
You can configure a maximum of three system message logging servers. One of these syslog servers should be Fabric Manager if you want to view system messages from the Event tab in Fabric Manager.
To send log messages to a UNIX system message logging server, you must configure the system message logging daemon on a UNIX server. Log in as root, and follow these steps:
Step 1 Add the following line to the /etc/syslog.conf file.
local1.debug                    /var/log/myfile.log

Note Be sure to add five tab characters between local1.debug and /var/log/myfile.log. Refer to entries in the /etc/syslog.conf file for further examples.
The switch sends messages according to the specified facility types and severity levels. The local1 keyword specifies the UNIX logging facility used. The messages from the switch are generated by user processes. The debug keyword specifies the severity level of the condition being logged. You can set UNIX systems to receive all messages from the switch.
Step 2 Create the log file by entering these commands at the UNIX shell prompt:
$ touch /var/log/myfile.log
$ chmod 666 /var/log/myfile.log

Step 3 Make sure the system message logging daemon reads the new changes by entering this command:
$ kill -HUP ~cat /etc/syslog.pid~

Note Most tabs in the Information pane for features using CFS are dimmed until you click the CFS tab. The CFS tab shows which switches have CFS enabled and shows the master switch for this feature. Once the CFS tab is click, the other tabs in the Information pane that use CFS are activated.
To configure system message logging servers, follow these steps:
Step 1 In Fabric Manager, expand Switches, expand Events and select SysLog in the Physical Attributes pane, then click the Servers tab in the Information pane.
Figure 3-6 Servers Tab in Fabric Manager Syslog
In Device Manager, choose Logs > Syslog > Setup and click the Servers tab in the syslog dialog box.
Figure 3-7 Servers Tab in Device Manager Syslog
Step 2 Click the Create Row icon in Fabric Manager, or click Create in Device Manager (see Figure 3-7) to add a new syslog server.
Step 3 Enter the name or IP address in dotted decimal notation (for example, 192.168.2.12) of the syslog server in the Name or IP Address field.
Step 4 Set the message severity threshold by clicking the MsgSeverity radio button and set the facility by clicking the Facility radio button.
Step 5 Click the Apply Changes icon in Fabric Manager, or click Create in Device Manager to save and apply your changes.
Device Manager allows you to view event logs on your local PC as well as those on the switch. For a permanent record of all events that occur on the switch, you should store these messages off the switch. To do this the MDS switch must be configured to send syslog messages to your local PC and a syslog server must be running on that PC to receive those messages. These messages can be categorized into four classes:
•Hardware—Line card or power supply problems
•Link Incidents—FICON port condition changes
•Accounting—User change events
•Events—All other events
Note You should avoid using PCs that have IP addresses randomly assigned to them by DHCP. The switch continues to use the old IP address unless you manually change it; however, the Device Manager prompts you if it does detect this situation. UNIX workstations have a built-in syslog server. You must have root access (or run the Cisco syslog server as setuid to root) to stop the built-in syslog daemon and start the Cisco syslog server.
Verifying Syslog Servers from Fabric Manager Web Server
To verify the syslog servers remotely using Fabric Manager Web Server, follow these steps:
Step 1 Point your browser at the Fabric Manager Web Server.
Step 2 Choose Events > Syslog to view the syslog server information for each switch. The columns in the table are sortable.
Monitoring Syslog Server from Fabric Manager
Cisco Fabric Manager Server registers itself as a logging server and receives syslog messages and stores them in separate files for each switch.
With Cisco NX-OS Release 5.0(1a) and later, the Fabric Manager Server stores the syslog messages from all the switches in a fabric to a database, and displays only the aggregated syslog information from the web client. This feature can be enabled or disabled. The syslog stored in the database is filtered by a configurable severity level.
Once the Fabric Manager Server receives the syslog messages through the syslog receiver, the raw messages are parsed and the flag for persisting the message in the database is checked. The severity carried by this message is checked from the parsed fields, and the syslog messages are sent to the database.
The raw syslog messages are parsed into the following fields: switch time, facility, severity, event, and Vsan Id. The description is stored in the database and filtered by the severity level.
The following fields are added to server.properties:
•syslog.dblog.enable = false
This field is used to turn on the feature for storing the syslog messages into the database. By turning on this flag, the syslog messages are also written into the database.
•syslog.dblog.severity = warnings
This field is used to filter the syslog messages based on the severity. By configuring this property, syslog messages are filtered on the severity level.
Figure 3-8 displays the syslog messages in Fabric Manager.

System Message Logging
The system message logging software saves the messages in a log file or directs the messages to other devices. This feature has the following capabilities:
•Provides logging information for monitoring and troubleshooting.
•Allows the user to select the types of captured logging information.
•Allows the user to select the destination server to forward the captured logging information.
By default, the switch logs normal but significant system messages to a log file and sends these messages to the system console. You can specify which system messages should be saved based on the type of facility and the severity level. Messages are time-stamped to enhance real-time debugging and management.
You can access the logged system messages using the CLI or by saving them to a correctly configured system message logging server. The switch software saves system messages in a file that can save up to 1200 entries. You can monitor system messages remotely by accessing the switch through Telnet, SSH, the console port, or by viewing the logs on a system message logging server.
Outgoing System Message Logging Server Facilities
All system messages have a logging facility and a level. The logging facility can be thought of as where and the level can be thought of as what.
The single system message logging daemon (syslogd) sends the information based on the configured facility option. If no facility is specified, local7 is the default outgoing facility.
The internal facilities are listed in Table 3-1 and the outgoing logging facilities are listed in Table 3-3.

Viewing Logs from Fabric Manager Web Server
To view system messages remotely using Fabric Manager Web Server, follow these steps:
Step 1 Point your browser at the Fabric Manager Web Server.
Step 2 Click the Events tab followed by the Details to view the system messages. The columns in the events table are sortable. In addition, you can use the Filter button to limit the scope of messages within the table.
Viewing Logs from Device Manager
You can view system messages from Device Manager if Device Manager is running from the same workstation as the Fabric Manager Server. Choose Logs > Events > current to view the system messages on Device Manager. The columns in the events table are sortable. In addition, you can use the Find button to locate text within the table.
You can view switch-resident logs even if you have not set up your local syslog server or your local PC is not in the switch's syslog server list. Due to memory constraints, these logs will wrap when they reach a certain size. The switch syslog has two logs: an NVRAM log that holds a limited number of critical and greater messages and a nonpersistent log that contains notice or greater severity messages. Hardware messages are part of these logs.
System Message Logging Configuration Distribution
You can enable fabric distribution for all Cisco MDS switches in the fabric. When you perform system message logging configurations, and distribution is enabled, that configuration is distributed to all the switches in the fabric.
You automatically acquire a fabric-wide lock when you issue the first configuration command after you enabled distribution in a switch. The system message logging server uses the effective and pending database model to store or commit the commands based on your configuration. When you commit the configuration changes, the effective database is overwritten by the configuration changes in the pending database and all the switches in the fabric receive the same configuration. After making the configuration changes, you can choose to discard the changes by aborting the changes instead of committing them. In either case, the lock is released. See Chapter 2, "Using the CFS Infrastructure" for more information on the CFS application.
Fabric Lock Override
If you have performed a system message logging task and have forgotten to release the lock by either committing or discarding the changes, an administrator can release the lock from any switch in the fabric. If the administrator performs this task, your changes to the pending database are discarded and the fabric lock is released.
Tip The changes are only available in the volatile directory and are subject to being discarded if the switch is restarted.
Database Merge Guidelines
See the "CFS Merge Support" section on page 2-10 for detailed concepts.
When merging two system message logging databases, follow these guidelines:
•Be aware that the merged database is a union of the existing and received database for each switch in the fabric.
•Verify that the merged database will only have a maximum of three system message logging servers.
Caution If the merged database contains more that three servers, the merge will fail.
