    Cisco Crosswork™ Change Automation and Health Insights provide a programmable automation system that supports closed-loop operations based on configurable KPIs and feedback-driven workflows.
Product overview
Network operators are challenged with exponential growth in network traffic and increases in the number of network endpoints. At the same time, there is tremendous pressure to efficiently and cost-effectively run network operations. This highlights the importance of modernized operations enabled with automation to substantially improve operational efficiency.
Cisco Crosswork Network Automation: Cisco Crosswork Network Automation is an outcome-driven automation software suite used to deliver efficient mass-scale network operations. It includes the ability to implement programmable closed-loop operations using Crosswork Change Automation and Crosswork Health Insights applications. These applications help to streamline and implement network-focused Method Of Procedure (MOP) for automating remediation and maintenance tasks.
Cisco Crosswork Change Automation: Cisco Crosswork Change Automation helps to codify workflows using parameterized Plays and stitches them into Playbooks for execution in a step-by-step or single-step fashion. It offers programmability and user control much needed when automating MOP in today’s operations environment. Any network or service configuration changes codified as part of the MOP get pushed to Cisco® Network Services Orchestrator (NSO) to be deployed to the network.
Cisco Crosswork Health Insights: Cisco Crosswork Health Insights offers real-time, telemetry-based Key Performance Indicator (KPI) monitoring and intelligent alerting. The alerts are based on predefined templates or user-defined logic. These alerts can be tied to the Playbooks to implement closed-loop automation workflows.

Crosswork Change Automation
Flexible workflow execution
●  Dramatically reduces the time to execute planned and unplanned changes to the network
Continuous, single-step, or dry-run execution
●  Flexible execution modes with user control
●  Validate Playbook execution flow and verify configuration changes without making them using the dry-run mode
Scheduled execution
●  Ability to schedule Playbook execution can be used in many ways—for example:
Schedule maintenance tasks in the designated maintenance window
Schedule service provisioning, activation, and deactivation at specific times based on customer request
Out-of-the-box Plays
●  Leverage deployment best practices with prebuilt Plays to simplify network automation tasks
Custom Playbook development
●  Flexible framework that allows you to create network-focused workflow or MOPs
Rollback
●  User control with ability to rollback all changes during Playbook execution or changes related to any previous plays
Pre- and post-check
●  Ability to organize the tasks to help validate if the network state has been restored after Playbook execution is complete
Detailed audit trail
●  Enhance traceability with ability to track who executed the Playbook and when was it executed
Closed-loop remediation
The ability to identify and remediate problems in the network before customers notice is critical for network operators. With the Crosswork Change Automation and Health Insights closed-loop function, service providers can automate the process of discovering and remediating problems in the network by allowing an operator to match an alert to predefined remediation tasks. These tasks will automatically be performed once a defined Key Performance Indicator (KPI) threshold has been breached.
Remediation can be implemented with or without the network operator approval, depending on the setting and preferences of the operator.
Using closed-loop remediation reduces the time it takes to discover and repair a problem while minimizing the risk of making a mistake and creating an additional error through high-stakes manual network operator intervention.
Platform support information
Cisco Crosswork supports collection of telemetry using gNMI and Cisco MDT, depending on the platform and associated software version.* For Cisco XR devices, gNMI telemetry is supported for Cisco native IOS® XR and openconfig YANG models. Supported encoding types are gnmi.proto and JSON_IETF. Cisco MDT requires CLI NED version 7.33.1 and NetConf NED version 7.3.1.**
Cisco Crosswork also supports the collection of standard MIBs using SNMP.
