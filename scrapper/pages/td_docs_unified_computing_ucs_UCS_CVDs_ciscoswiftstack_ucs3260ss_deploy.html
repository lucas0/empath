Solution Overview
Introduction
Object storage is a highly scalable system for organizing and storing data objects. Object storage does not use a file system structure, instead it ingests data as objects with unique keys into a flat directory structure and the metadata is stored with the objects instead of hierarchical journal or tree. Search and retrieval is performed via these unique keys for searching. Most of the newly generated data is unstructured today. With about 80 percent of data being unstructured, new approaches using x86 servers are proving to be more cost effective, providing storage that can be expanded as easily as your data grows. Object storage is the newest approach for handling massive amounts of data.
SwiftStack based on open source Swift, enables applications to store data that is usable by object applications and cloud-native applications alike.
Together with Cisco UCS, SwiftStack Storage can deliver a fully enterprise-ready solution that can manage different workloads and still remain flexible. The Cisco UCS S3260 Storage Server is an excellent platform to use with the main types of Swift workloads, such as capacity-optimized and performance-optimized workloads. It is also excellent for workloads with a large number of I/O operations per second and scales well for varying work load and block sizes.

Technology Overview
Cisco Unified Computing System
The Cisco Unified Computing System (Cisco UCS) is a state-of-the-art data center platform that unites computing, network, storage access, and virtualization into a single cohesive system.
The main components of Cisco Unified Computing System are:
Computing - The system is based on an entirely new class of computing system that incorporates rack-mount and blade servers based on Intel Xeon Processor E5 and E7. The Cisco UCS servers offer the patented Cisco Extended Memory Technology to support applications with large datasets and allow more virtual machines (VM) per server.
Network - The system is integrated onto a low-latency, lossless, 40-Gbps unified network fabric.  This network foundation consolidates LANs, SANs, and high-performance computing networks which are separate networks today.  The unified fabric lowers costs by reducing the number of network adapters, switches, and cables, and by decreasing the power and cooling requirements.
Virtualization - The system unleashes the full potential of virtualization by enhancing the scalability, performance, and operational control of virtual environments.  Cisco security, policy enforcement, and diagnostic features are now extended into virtualized environments to better support changing business and IT requirements.
Storage access - The system provides consolidated access to both SAN storage and Network Attached Storage (NAS) over the unified fabric. By unifying the storage access, the Cisco Unified Computing System can access storage over Ethernet (NFS or iSCSI), Fibre Channel, and Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE). This provides customers with choice for storage access and investment protection. In addition, the server administrators can pre-assign storage-access policies for system connectivity to storage resources, simplifying storage connectivity, and management for increased productivity.
The Cisco Unified Computing System is designed to deliver:
A reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and increased business agility.
Increased IT staff productivity through just-in-time provisioning and mobility support.
A cohesive, integrated system which unifies the technology in the data center.
Industry standards supported by a partner ecosystem of industry leaders.

Configure Nexus 9332PQ Switch A and B
Both Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect A and B are connected to two Cisco Nexus 9332PQ switches for connectivity to Upstream Network. The following sections describe the setup of both Cisco Nexus 9332PQ switches.
1.    Connect the console port to the Nexus 9332 PQ switch designated for Fabric A:
---- Basic System Configuration Dialog VDC: 1 ----
This setup utility will guide you through the basic configuration of the system. Setup configures only enough connectivity for management of the system.
*Note: setup is mainly used for configuring the system initially, when no configuration is present. So setup always assumes system defaults and not the current system configuration values.
Press Enter at anytime to skip a dialog. Use ctrl-c at anytime to skip the remaining dialogs.

Ethernet Adapter Policy Setup
By default, Cisco UCS provides a set of Ethernet adapter policies. These policies include the recommended settings for each supported server operating system. Operating systems are sensitive to the settings in these policies.
          Cisco UCS best practice is to enable Jumbo Frames MTU 9000 for any Storage facing Networks (Outward facing Network, Cluster Network and Replication Network). For Jumbo Frames MTU9000, you can use default Ethernet Adapter Policy predefined as Linux. Once the jumbo frame setting are made in the vNIC template as above the ether interface created on the Operating System will get its MTU as 9000.
You can also create a specific adapter policy and it is beneficial in particular if you are using MTU 1500 say for outward facing network.
To create a specific adapter policy for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, complete the following steps:
1.    Select the Server tab in the left pane of the UCSM GUI.

y.     Click OK and then OK and again OK.
4.    Storage Profile for the second Server:
Follow the exact steps as above for creating a storage profile for the second server in the chassis. Add slot numbers as 203 and 204 while creating the Disk Group Policy say Server2. The Storage Profile Server1 is for the top Server and Server 2 for the bottom Server of S3260.
Storage Profile for Cisco UCS C220M4S Rack Server
1.    Create another Storage profile for Swift Controller Boot Disks. Identify the disk numbers from Server Inventory and Create another Storage profile say Control following the similar steps as above.
Create Service Profile Templates
Creating Service Profile Templates for Cisco UCS S3260 Storage Servers
Depending on whether you will be deploying a single or a dual node configuration you may need one or two Service profile templates for S3260 server.
A single service profile template with all the 56 disks should suffice in case of single node configuration. On the other hand you may need to two templates, one for the top and other for the bottom server in case of dual node configuration.
To create a Service Profile Template, complete the following steps:
Identify Service Profile Template
1.    Select Servers in the left pane of the UCSM GUI.
2.    Go to Servers > Service Profile Templates > root and right-click Create Service Profile Template.
3.    Enter the Name of the template say S3260-Server1.
4.    Check as Updating Template.
5.    The UUID pool created earlier for Swift and click Next.
Storage Provisioning
1.    Go to Storage Profile Policy Tab and select the Storage profile created. For this particular Storage Template for the Top Servers select server1 created earlier and then click Next.
  Networking
In the Networking tab, complete the following steps:
1.    Select the expert Mode and Click Add for Creating vNICâs.
2.    Enter, External in the name field and check the vnic template flag.
3.    Select name of the vNIC Template as âExternalâ created earlier.
4.    Select the adapter policy âRHELâ created earlier for adapter policies.
5.    Click OK.
6.    Add other Ethernet Interfaces, the Outward facing, Cluster and Replication to the list as below before clicking Next.
          Ignore SAN Connectivity and Zoning by clicking Next.
SAN Connectivity
1.    Select No vHBAâs in SAN Connectivity tab.
Zoning
1.    Click Next and ignore Zoning.
vNIC/vHBA Placement
1.    In the Select Placement Drop Down, Specify Manually.
2.    Highlight vCon1 and then assign the interfaces in the following order â External, Swift-Client, Swift-Cluster, Swift-Repl and then click Next.
Server Boot Order
Select the Boot Policy Swift-Boot Created earlier and click Next.
  Maintenance Policy
Select maintenance Policy Server_ACK in the drop down, that was created earlier. Click Next.
Server Assignment
Leave everything as default and click Next.
Operational Policies
Select Power Control Policy NO-POWER-CAP create earlier and finish the configuration.
          In case of Dual Node Configuration you may have to create one more template S3260-Server2 that attaches Server2 Storage Policy ( with lun idâs 203 and 204 ).
Create Service Profile Template for Cisco UCS C220 M4S
The Service Profile for the Rack-Mount Servers for Swift Controllers (Active and Standby) is very similar to the above created for the S3260. The only differences are with the Storage Profiles, Networking and vNIC/vHBA Placement. The changes are listed here:
1.    In the Storage Provisioning tab choose the appropriate Storage Profile for the Cisco UCS C220 M4S you created earlier.
          The Networking tab will have only two Interfaces one for the nodes External communication and the other for outward facing network. In the setup used for the CVD, the outward facing network made available to the controller though this is not necessary.
          The vNIC/vHBA Placement tab will list the first interface as external and the second interface as the outward facing network.
2.    Walk through the remaining tabs similar to S3260 by adding Maintenance Policies and complete the creation of Service Profile Template C220.
Summary
There will be three service profile templates, one for each server of S3260 and another for SwiftStack Controllers. In case of a single node configuration, you should have only two Service Profile templates; one for S3260 and the other for Controller. If there are other blade or Rack mounted servers that you would like to connect to these SwiftStack servers acting as clients, create the necessary Service Profile templates and profiles.

Post Cisco UCS Configuration Health Checks
The following is a list of health checks to be carried out before Installing Operating System and SwiftStack software.
1.    Go to Equipment Tab, Fabric Interconnects, Ethernet ports and check the status of Server and Network Ports. Alternatively open a putty session to Fabric Interconnect, connect nxos a (or b) and check the status of ports with show interface brief.
2.    Repeat this step by logging into Nexus Switches and check the status of ports and port-channels if any.
3.    For each server node, the S3260 Storage Server Node(s) or the Swift Controller check the Inventory tab for CPU and Memory details and Critical Faults.
4.    Under the same Inventory tab for the server under storage tab and then in Luns check the status of the boot lun. After successful application of the service profile, this should show as RAID1 Mirrored and in applied status as below.
5.    Under the same Inventory tab and in Disks, make sure that other SSD and HDD disks are available. If installing OS manually through Red Hat UI, you will select the Virtual Drive as shown in step 4 above and the rest if any jbods can be left as is. If automated through pxe install the other HDD and SSDâs should be made as unconfigured too.
6.    Under the same inventory tab check the number of NICâs are same as desired for that server. There should be a minimum of 4 NICâs for Storage Nodes.

Health Checks
After completing the steps detailed in the previous section on all the servers, make sure that the connectivity works amongst the servers and if using jumbo frames do a ping test with a jumbo packet size.
Also make sure by logging to each server and checking through /proc/partitions that both HDD ad SSD disks are visible to the operating system.  If any of these are left out in âunconfiguredâ state, turn to JBOD mode either through Cisco UCS Manager or through storcli.
Install SwiftStack Software
Pre-installation Checks
          Make sure that SSH Trust is enabled amongst all the controller and storage nodes.
Below is an example of setting up the ssh-trust:
ssh-keygen -t rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
â¦..
  Use ssh-copy-id to copy the files.
ssh-copy-id root@swiftstack-server2
            Establish trust between all the nodes before proceeding with the installation.
Install On-Premise Controller Software

SwiftStack Health Checks
SwiftStack Controller Monitoring and Metrics
SwiftStack Controller metrics are collected in 30 second intervals, with time series data base graphs available for up to 3 yearsâ worth of review. Many basic graphs like CPU, IO and network are available showing overall system health results both at Cluster and Node levels. Swift specific graphs also available showing trends in request handling, error counts that are useful for viewing large changes and troubleshooting.
SwiftStack Controller Alerts
Swift Nodeâs alerts can be managed via the controller and alerts can be acknowledged and then archived as desired.
When an alert is received, you can review the alert guide in the SwiftStack Controller documentation https://www.swiftstack.com/docs/. Click on Alerts/Events section to get more details on the alerts.
Load Testing and Performance Evaluation
Load Testing was done on the cluster to evaluate the performance under different configurations. SSBENCH tool was used to test the cluster. The following points were considered while doing the performance testing.
1.    All the tests were conducted on default configurations both from Cisco UCS and SwiftStack side to make it as much generic as possible. It is possible that we get better results when Tuning is attempted on both.
2.    The purpose of the tests is to get an idea of the performance of the cluster and should nowhere be considered as benchmark values. Most of the effort was spent to get the values of how the cluster will scale up when more chassis/disks are added and also while adding more cpu/mem/network through a separate server node, nor any attempt was made to tune the configuration to its optimal values.
3.    All of the tests listed below were conducted in Replicated mode.
4.    A sufficient number of Clients were added to saturate the cluster. Each server had 40 Gb of Network configured for client traffic. Hence in a 12 Node configuration, with a max capacity of 480 Gb of Client network configured on servers, equal number of clients were added to the infrastructure that can push the traffic to servers close to 480 Gb. This is in particular useful when your workload is bandwidth intensive like on block size like 1MB and more.
5.    Performance data was gathered on the following configurations:
  Disks
(10 TB HDD for objects and 400GB SSDâs for A/C and containers)
Network
3 Chassis  3 Nodes
162 HDD + 6  SSD
120Gb client + 120Gb cluster/Repl
 3 Chassis 6 Nodes
162 HDD + 6 SSD
240Gb client + 240Gb cluster/repl
6 Chassis 6 Nodes
324 HDD + 12 SSD
240Gb client + 240Gb cluster/repl
6 chassis 12 Node
324 HDD + 12 SSD
480Gb client + 480Gb cluster/repl
3 Chassis - 3Nodes
The values obtained for PUTS and GETS are plotted below.
The following points can be concluded:
1.    Around 2000 req/sec of PUT requests at 1k and 4k block sizes.
2.    More than 7000 req/sec of GET requests observed as peak. This is slightly more than 3 times the PUTS requests. It has to be noted that PUTS aka writes will have an overhead of 3x because of replication.
3.    Peak bandwidth of 3000 MBPS for PUTS and 6000 MBPS for GETS.
3 Chassis - 6Nodes
The following points can be concluded:
1.    Around 4000 req/sec of PUT requests at 1k and 4k block sizes.
2.    Around 15000 req/sec of GET requests observed as peak.
3.    Bandwidth from client side observed as 5200 MBPS for PUTS while GETS got around 13800 MBPS.
6 Chassis - 6Nodes
  The following points can be concluded:
1.    Around 4200 PUTS and 14,500 of GETS.
2.    Bandwidth from client side observed to be around 5300 MBPS for PUTS and 19000 MBPS for GETS.
3.    The graphs collected from the controller show a higher peak values than the average values obtained from ssbench. This shows that for a given period of test from start to end it has averaged.

2.    Bandwidth from client side observed to be around 9400 MBPS for PUTS and 35000 MBPS for GETS.
3.    The graphs collected from the controller show a higher peak values than the average values obtained from ssbench. This shows that for a given period of test from start to end it has averaged.
Sizing Guidelines and Scalability of the Cluster
Sizing Guidelines
Choosing the right hardware and number of nodes needed for your application is key. While both Cisco S3260 and SwiftStack give you the option of scaling out the storage as needed, it is best if the requirements are understood correctly and then sized.
The sizing of the cluster depends on several factors, a few are listed below:
The total usable space needed in the cluster.
The type of replication you would like to have for your application â Replicated mode vs Erasure Coded mode.
How many regions you are planning for your cluster.
Network Availability between the cluster nodes and your client nodes to the Cluster.
Number of HTTP requests to or from the cluster to the clients.
For a complete reference of the design and hardware guidelines, it is recommended to go through the SwiftStack documentation: https://www.swiftstack.com/docs/. A few points derived from the test bed based on the performance criteria when using S3260 storage server with 40Gb network is mentioned in this documentation.
Usable Space
The setup used replication. This means every write to the cluster is followed by 2 other writes to two other nodes in the cluster. The effective usable space in the cluster, hence is 1/3rd of the raw space.
Considering 54 x 10TB of disks in a full chassis, the usable space will be around 1PB,  in replicated mode for a 6 Chassis cluster. Size your cluster per your usable space requirements.
It is also recommended to leave some free space in the cluster should there be a failure in any one of the nodes. In case of complete failure of a node, SwiftStack will distribute the used blocks to the remaining nodes. In other words in a 6 node cluster, the blocks will be distributed to 5 nodes now. There should be sufficient space left in the cluster for such healthy operations and for business continuity.
HTTP Requests
As mentioned earlier the number of GET and PUT requests and the block size at which this IO happens also matters. In a replicated configuration, PUTS are close to 1/3rd of GETS provided they are no other disk and/or network bottlenecks in the system.
Performance data gathered on four different configurations was gathered to understand how S3260 and SwiftStack would behave when more number of chassisâ and nodes  were added to the cluster.
Case Study
The performance tests were conducted on 3 chassis and 6 chassis with both single and dual node configurations. Below is a case study of 4 block sizes and the GET and PUT requests obtained from the test bed.

*** Approximate Calculations on usable space based on base 2 for storage from disk manufacturers and assuming that only 1/3 of space from raw available because of replication.
Plotting a graph for PUTS and GETS to better analyze the data.
Summary
The following conclusions can be made:
1.    Decide the number of chassisâ required based on the raw and usable storage needed.
a.     Usable space is 1/3rd in a fully replicated mode.
b.    Leave one storage node as spare to take care of failures (N +1 architecture).
c.     Leave 20% operating margin.
d.    Add space for future expansion as well as organic growth.
2.    The performance of the cluster increases with number of nodes. More the nodes (the CPU, memory and network) better the performance is.
3.    From 3 chassis to 6 chassis, the output is almost doubled (single node to single node and dual node to dual node comparison)
4.    Higher blocks sizes seem to get a better benefit by adding additional nodes as the network bandwidth is doubled.
The sizing of the cluster depends on the usable space, number of nodes and performance expectations based on the applications requirements.
 
  Scalability
Considering the data of scalability for a given block size, this is how system could scale by adding more chassis and nodes.
Both PUTS and GETS expected to scale linearly by adding more nodes to the system.
High Availability and Business Continuity
The High Availability of the solution was validated by failing out one of the components of the infrastructure. Following points were considered for Business Continuity.
The Cluster will have reasonable amount of load when the fault is injected. The outputs like Total Cluster Disk I/O or Gets/Puts requested to be gathered before and after Fault injection.
Only one fault injected at any point of time. No double failures considered.
Performance degradation is acceptable but there shouldnât be any business interruption. The underlying infrastructure components should continue to operate with the remaining components.
A few of the HA tests conducted are:
Swift Stack Chassis and Node Failures
Swift Stack Controller Failures
Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect Failure
Cisco Nexus Switch Failure
Figure 14 shows the High Availability Tests conducted on the infrastructure

  Figure 14     High Availability Tests

  SwiftStack Node Failures
Client workload started on the Cluster with SwiftStack Load Balancer.
Sequence of Events
While cluster was running on load, data was gathered on IO, and one chassis was powered off (Nodes pulled out from the chassis), simulating a hardwarefailure. After few minutes of running the cluster in this state, a hard power down of nodes was also issued from Cisco UCS on another chassis. The nodes were powered on and both the chassisâ were brought up again after few minutes.
Dstat output gathered on one of the server nodes:
This server was doing disk reads of 2000M, a total Network output of 3800M when the fault was injected.
The total IO of the cluster was around 25 GB/s before fault injection.
Cisco UCS show Critical Alert that the Chassis cannot be accessed anymore.
Drop in Proxy Throughput observed as below:
The overall activity as recorded by SwiftStack controller is as shown below:
  Summary
When the first chassis was brought down a drop in IO observed around 18:30. System continues to operate with 20GB/sec.
At around 18:40 second chassis was brought down and IO dropped almost to 15GB/sec.
System fully recovers when chassisâ were plugged back in.
SwiftStack Controller Failures
SwiftStack controller is not in the data path. No interruption to the client traffic was observed when the Controller node was brought down.
Summary
The clients communicated directly with the PACO nodes and there was no interruption. However, any monitoring, SNMP alerts configured etc. will not work. There is a need to activate the Standby Controller and make it Primary in case it is decided that itâs a total hardware failure and cannot be recovered soon. This is covered in the following section.
Activate Standby Controller to Primary
1.    Update the DNS entry (or /etc/hosts) for the name of the controller to be accessed appropriately.
2.    Login to the controller UI, Click on Admin tab and then Recovery or directly login to https://swiftcontroller.cisco.com/recovery/standbys/.
The following information will be displayed:
First restore the controller before enable. As the backup is taken on swift, it will sync up from the database and once completed could be enabled.
The standby controller becomes primary. You may continue to operate in this mode or revert back to the original primary when the problem was fixed.
Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect Failures
Client workload started on the Cluster.
Sequence of events:
While cluster was running on load data gathered on IO. One of the Fabrics was rebooted and any changes to IO pattern was observed. The reboot was done on Secondary first and then the tests were repeated on Primary.
The tests were conducted for both Gets and Puts operations.
Dstat output gathered on one of the server nodes while running PUTS.
This server was doing a disk writes of 2148M and handling 750M of Client Traffic while generating around 2000M of Cluster traffic.
Logged into surviving Fabric Interconnects to check the status of the cluster and it was down.

  Swift Controller does not point out any errors or devices/nodes when FI is getting rebooted.
Summary:
No interruption of traffic was observed. A small drop in output when the entire traffic is handled by single FI.
The drop in performance also depends on distribution of links and head room available on one Single FI to handle all of the load.
It was around 20GB/sec for puts and 35 GB/s for gets. In both the cases FI handled the traffic, vNICâs failed over to surviving FI, vNICâs failed back and MAC learning completed fine after FI came back and the business was as usual.
Cisco Nexus 9332 Failures

Sequence of events:
While cluster was running, load data gathered on IO. One of the Nexus Switches was rebooted and any changes to IO pattern was observed.

Scaling up the Cluster
This section provides a short description about how to scale up the cluster.
Adding Nodes to Cisco UCS
1.    Make sure that the chassis and/or nodes VICâs are connected to the Fabric Interconnects. Power on the chassis. System should do auto-discovery.
2.    When the Chassis is discovered, make sure that the inventory (CPU, memory, disks) are fine as expected.
3.    Make sure that you have enough room available in UUID, KVM and IP pools. Else create a new pool to add more IPâs or UUIDâs.
4.    Create Service Profiles from the Service Profile Templates. Make sure that the disks are in unconfigured state and apply the newly created Service Profiles.
5.    After observing that virtual lun is created in the inventory > storage tab after applying the Service Profile, install the operating system.
6.    As mentioned in the OS post Install section, update linux kernel with yum and complete any other configurations mentioned in the post-install section.
System is ready to be added as a node to the Cluster.
Adding Nodes to SwiftStack Cluster
1.    Copy the ssman.crt file from Controller Node to the new Storage node.
scp ssman.crt root@swiftstack-new-node:/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
Run update-ca-trust extract on the new storage node.
  2.    Run the Curl Command on the storage node. This will download the necessary packages and installs the software.
curl https://swiftcontroller.cisco.com:443/install | sudo bash
3.    Run the ssclaimurl on a browser and claim the node
4.    In case you are using SwiftStack Load Balancer, reconfigure.
5.    Ingest the nodes
6.    Click on Setup of the nodes â format the disks, add SSD and HDDâs to respective policies. SSDâs go to Account and Container Policy, while HDDâs to Standard-Replica policy.
7.    Do not deploy the configuration yet in case you have more nodes to be added now. Complete all the nodes setup upto step 6 above, enable them and then deploy the configuration.
This completes the addition of new node(s) in the cluster. Please note that this could automatically kick in the rebalance activity. The time it takes to distribute used space to the new nodes depends on the used space in the cluster, prior to the addition. While this is a background job, it does consume some network and disk resources. There will be traffic flow through the replication nic configured on the system. This activity can be speeded up or slowed down by tuning the resources in the tuning section. Please contact swiftstack support team that is optimal for your configuration.
Migrating to Dual Node Configuration
If you have a single node configuration and would like to upgrade to a dual node configuration please follow the steps below.
Delete the chassis with single node
1.    Login to controller, Manager SwiftStack Controller and then click Nodes.
2.    Click Manage and then disable the node and then deploy the configuration. This will let the Cluster know that one of the nodes has been disabled.
3.    Go back to the disabled node in the same manage page (it will be in disabled mode now). Click on setup now, select all drives and then unmount them. You may also monitor the devices by logging into the node and by running df âk.
4.    In the same page with devices unmounted, select all the drives and click âDeleteâ now, which will make the disks as unmanaged drives now.
5.    Now you can delete this node. This will remove the devices and the node from ring.
6.    If not already done, deploy the config to the cluster. This will make the cluster nodes as âN-1â now. This can be verified from clicking on the nodes again.
7.    This will also trigger rebalance activity in the cluster for both Account and containers (2 SSDâs deleted) and objects or standard replica.
8.    Network activity can be verified by logging into any of the nodes.
This completes the deletion of the node.
Add the Second Node to Chassis
Add the hardware, the second Server, SIOC and connect the 40G Twin-Ax cables to both the Fabric Interconnects. For details of connectivity, refer to Initial setup and then discover the hardware in Cisco UCS. If needed add necessary KVM IPâs, MAC and UUIDâs.
Reconfigure Chassis in Cisco UCS
Associate Chassis Profile
Refer to the section above for creating chassis profile template. Create a new Chassis profile template with âdual nodeâ disk zoning policy as mentioned in this section. Create a chassis profile from this template and then associate to this chassis. The Dual Node disk zoning policy will add the first 28 disks to first node and the rest 28 to the second node. Make sure that each server gets 1 SSD in its distribution else move the SSD disks appropriately within the storage slots.
Associate Service Profile
Create a new Service Profile template if needed and then associate them to the 2 new nodes.
Install Operating System and SwiftStack Software
Follow the Operating system installation steps, post-install checks, and then install the SwiftStack Software on the two nodes as mentioned earlier in this document.
Install SwiftStack software, claim the node, format the disks, add policies and then enable the nodes in the controller.
Final Steps
When the node is added back to the cluster, it may trigger to re-balance the disks again. The rebalance activity on SSDâs and HDDâs depend on the used space within the cluster.
Repeat all of the steps in case you need to make the rest of the chassis also as dual node.
Frequently Asked Questions
Cisco UCS
1.    What Cisco UCS Manager version is supported with SwiftStack on Cisco UCS?
SwiftStack has been validated with UCSM version 3.x and with 40Gb Fabric Interconnects and Switches. It is strongly recommended to run the infrastructure on versions higher than the validation done in this CVD.
2.    Can I use 10GB Nexus Switches in the infrastructure?
This hasnât been validated but might still work. It is strongly recommended again to use 40Gb network between the Storage Nodes. By using 10GB with splitter cables, you might be underutilizing the hardware.
3.    How many minimum nodes are recommended?
This is as per the SDS requirements. The validation was done with minimum of 3 nodes and then scaled up further.
SwiftStack
1.    The CVD talks about performance data collected in Replicated mode. Where can I get information on EC (Erasure Coding)?
Erasure coding and savings in space with a little performance hit are known in SDS world. We will be validating this soon in the infra and will update this CVD.
2.    How many nodes can system scale up?
SwiftStack can scale up to petabytes of usable data. The nodes can be added and/or deleted as mentioned in the scale up section. You may have to check for the availability of the ports on the upstream switches.
Troubleshooting
1.    I am unable to claim the node. System continuously spins but never presents me with a âClaim Nodeâ button. What should I do?
There can be network glitches and it is fine to retry the operation. In case you are not successful, follow these steps:
From the controller page, delete the node. Login to the server node and run /usr/bin/uninstall-swiftstack-node. This will completely remove the software from the system. Restart by running the curl command to add this node to the controller.
2.    What diagnostics can I run in server node to check the status of a storage node?
Running /usr/bin/ssdiag will spill out any errors. A healthy node may report as below
[root@swiftstack-server2 ~]# /usr/bin/ssdiag
SwiftStack Agent Version:        5.2.0.2-1

  3.    How do I check the health of a disk in SwiftStack?
Login to SwiftStack Server node and run utility âsdtâ utility provided by SwiftStack.
The status of individual disks can be queried as below:
4.    Swiftstack shows me an alert about a bad disk that needs to be replaced. How do I replace the correct disk in Cisco UCS?
a.     Go to the Managed Swift Drives page, and on the node tab in UI and then unmount the disk and then delete the disk. Note the device name as pointed out by Swift â say /dev/sdc.
b.    Check the existence and status in cat /proc/partitions and /dev/disk/by-*
c.     You may also have an alert in Cisco UCS. Check for any missing drives in the inventory tab of the server under disks.
d.    You can also run storcli to confirm the disk number which will report as bad disk.
e.    Check the disk number in storcli or UCS inventory and replace the disk. The disk numbers physically are numbered in 4 rows in S3260 as below. Identify the appropriate disk and replace it.
f.      Format the new drive and add policies as appropriate.
For further details please visit the page https://www.swiftstack.com/docs/cookbooks/ops/detect_and_replace_failed_drives.html.
          Please note that a disk LED locator can also be turned on, in Cisco UCS. However for this the power should be on and cables should be long enough when you pull the disk cabinet.
5.    Where to start looking for Swift logs?
On storage node check /var/log/swift/all.log
On Controller node check /opt/ss/var/log/*
6.    How can I use Python Swift Client?
python-swiftclient is handy to run few CLI commands and also for troubleshooting. Once python swiftclient is installed the parameters like authorization and users can be passed to swift and also can be put in bash or .profile. For instructions on how to install python-swiftclient please visit https://www.swiftstack.com/docs/integration/python-swiftclient.html.
    Alternatively make changes to your .bashrc file as below:
export ST_AUTH=http://192.168.120.202/auth/v1.0
export ST_USER=ssbench
export ST_KEY=ssbench
  Additional debug option can also be provided to the above URL
7.    Where can I download GUI version of SwiftStack Client?
You can download it from SwiftStack web site - https://www.swiftstack.com/downloads
A sample screen shot shown below:
  8.    There are several Tuning parameters in Controller node. How and what do I tune?
Most of the times the default settings should suffice. Tuning is a bit iterative and should be done carefully. All the tests done on the test bed were with default parameters. In case you think you could extract better values from the cluster, please contact swiftstack-support team.
