Scripting
Configuration
Open the Configuration Manager from the Webex CCE Tools folder on your desktop to enter and update information about the entities that are part of your enterprise.
Configured entities are stored as records in the Central Controller database tables. These entities include agents, call types, devices, PGs, services and service members, skill groups, and translation routes.
For error-free routing and accurate reporting, it is crucial to configure all peripheral targets—that is, any and all destinations to which a call can be sent. Reports show no data for devices that are not configured and monitored.
Changes and additions that you make in Configuration Manager are immediately applied to the Central Database on the Logger and are copied to all local databases.
Naming Conventions in Configuration
Naming Conventions in Configuration
Before configuring the system, consider how you want to name the reporting entities that you will be configuring—such as peripherals, skill groups, and agents.
The configured names for these entities appear in the Unified IC user interface as selection criteria for filtering reports. They are selected from Value Lists and Collections.
Use meaningful naming conventions to help reporting users interpret and locate the appropriate report selection items. For example, append the same prefix for all items associated with a particular site and use descriptive text to identify call types.
Scripting
After your configuration is defined, create routing scripts using the Script Editor. Webex CCE software uses these routing scripts to determine the best destination for a call by assessing the current call center activity that is extracted and forwarded by the PGs . The call flow defined in the script determines the data that is gathered for reporting.
Routing scripts contain instructions that:
Examine the call information provided by the routing client and use that information to classify the call as a particular call type.
Determine the best destination for the call.
Direct the call to an appropriate routing target; for example, to an individual agent, to a skill group, or to an appropriate announcement.
Post-route transfers and conferences.
Routing scripts are a representation of your business rules. You can create a specific set of scripts to be executed for each call type, such as Sales or Support. For more granular reports, you might want to create multiple scripts; for example, you might create a script for initial call classification and create scripts that route calls that are sent to particular services or skill groups on different ACDs.
You can also schedule different scripts to be used at different times of the day or different days of the week and year for each call type, and you can use dialed numbers to direct calls to scripts that handle transfers.
Routing script data are stored in the Central Controller database. Scripting changes that you make are applied to the local database, immediately update the Central Database on the Logger, and are copied to all local databases. You cannot alter scripts directly. Instead, you create and maintain routing scripts with the Script Editor, one of the tools on the Administration & Data Server.

ACD Script Considerations
Unexpected Scripting Conditions
ACD Script Considerations
Refer to your ACD Supplement Guide for any modifications you need to make in your ACD scripts. For example, you might need to modify your ACD scripts to include SEND INFO commands that notify Webex CCE when a call state transition occurs.
Also, ensure that the script the ACD follows to route the call to the appropriate agent takes into account the Services and the Service Members (skill groups) that are configured in Webex CCE.
Unexpected Scripting Conditions
Decide whether you want calls that encounter unexpected scripting conditions to be counted as default-routed or as errors.
If you want the calls to count as default-routed:
Plan to configure default labels for each dialed number. When a call is routed to a default label, the call is added to the count of default-routed calls for the call type. If the call cannot be routed and a default label is not assigned, the call is counted as an error.
Also, plan to include a Termination Node with Termination type of default label for all scripts in which there is some unexpected input (else condition).
In all scripts, account for failure by creating a path for calls that encounter unexpected conditions. You might want to route these calls to voicemail, an announcement, or a busy signal.
