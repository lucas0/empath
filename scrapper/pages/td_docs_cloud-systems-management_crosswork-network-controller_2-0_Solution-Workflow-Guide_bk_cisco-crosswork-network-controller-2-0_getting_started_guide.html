Installation Requirements for Cisco Crosswork Network Controller Components
High-level Installation Workflow
First Published: February 18, 2022
This document provides a high-level description of the steps that are required to install the Cisco Crosswork Network Controller solution, which is made up of the Cisco Crosswork Infrastructure, Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway, and several Cisco Crosswork applications.
It is a supplement to the Cisco Crosswork Infrastructure 4.0 and Applications Installation Guide, which provides full installation requirements and details for the Cisco Crosswork portfolio.
Each step in this high-level installation workflow links directly to the sections in the above-mentioned installation guide, making it easier for you to find information specific to Crosswork Network Controller.
This document is not intended to be a comprehensive installation guide.
Cisco Crosswork Network Controller
Cisco Crosswork Network Controller is a network automation solution for deploying and operating IP transport networks that delivers increased service agility, cost efficiency, and optimization for faster time-to-customer value and lower operating costs.
The solution combines intent-based network automation to deliver critical capabilities for service orchestration and fulfilment, network optimization, service path computation, device deployment and management, and anomaly detection and automatic remediation. Using telemetry gathering and automated responses, Cisco Crosswork Network Controller delivers network optimization capabilities that are nearly impossible to replicate even with a highly skilled and dedicated staff operating the network.
Its unified user interface allows real-time visualization of the network topology and services, as well as service and transport provisioning, through a single pane of glass.
The fully integrated solution combines core capabilities from multiple innovative, industry-leading products including Cisco® Network Services Orchestrator (NSO), Cisco Segment Routing Path Computation Element (SR-PCE), and the Cisco Crosswork suite of applications.

Installation Details
Cisco Crosswork Infrastructure (mandatory)
A microservices-based platform that is the foundation required for running Crosswork on-premise applications.
4.0
Cisco Crosswork Infrastructure Requirements
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway (mandatory)
Gathers information from the managed devices and forwards it to Cisco Crosswork Infrastructure and external destinations (if required).
2.0
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway Requirements
Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine (mandatory)
Provides real-time network optimization that allows operators to effectively maximize network capacity utilization, as well as increase service velocity.
2.0
Crosswork Portfolio Dependency matrix
Cisco Crosswork Active Topology (mandatory)
Enables visualization of topology and services on logical and geographical maps.
2.0
Cisco Crosswork Change Automation (optional)
Automates the process of deploying changes to the network.
4.0
Cisco Crosswork Health Insights (optional)
Performs real-time Key Performance Indicator (KPI) monitoring, alerting, and troubleshooting.
4.0
Cisco Crosswork Zero Touch Provisioning (optional)
Brings up compatible devices quickly and easily using a Cisco-certified software image and a day-zero software configuration of the customer's choice.
2.0
Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (Cisco NSO) (mandatory)
Crosswork Network Controller uses Cisco NSO for device management and service orchestration functionality. Cisco NSO is an orchestration platform that makes use of pluggable function packs to translate network-wide service intent into device-specific configuration. Cisco NSO provides flexible service orchestration and lifecycle management across physical and virtual network elements. For full Crosswork Network Controller functionality, Cisco NSO must be installed along with the Cisco NSO NEDs and function packs.
5.4.2 or 5.4.4.1
Cisco NSO and NED Requirements
Network Services Orchestrator Software- 5.4.2
Network Services Orchestrator Software 5.4.4.1
Cisco Network Element Drivers (NEDs) (mandatory)
Cisco NEDs comprise the network-facing part of Cisco NSO. They communicate over the native protocol supported by the device, such as Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF), Representational State Transfer (REST), Extensible Markup Language (XML), CLI, and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Cisco IOS XR:
CLI: 7.33, 7.33.1
NETCONF: 6.6, 6.6.3, 7.3, 7.3.1
Cisco IOS:
CLI: 6.67, 6.67.8
Cisco NSO Transport-SDN Function Pack (mandatory)
Consists of the following function packs:
SR-TE Core Function Pack (CFP) is a productized and supported implementation of SR-TE automation.
Cisco NSO Example Function Packs provide example implementations as a starting point for Layer 2 and Layer 3 VPN service provisioning functionality in Crosswork Network Controller. The intention is for customers to work with a Cisco Customer Experience representative to adapt these sample function packs to their specific networks and requirements.
2.0.0
Cisco NSO T-SDN Function Pack Bundle 2.0 Installation Guide
Cisco NSO Device Lifecycle Management (DLM) Service Pack (mandatory)
Installed on a Cisco NSO instance in order to synchronize device configurations in Cisco Crosswork with those in Cisco NSO. It effectively channels communication between the Crosswork DLM and Cisco NSO.
1.0
Cisco NSO DLM Service Pack 1.0 Installation Guide
Cisco Crosswork NSO Telemetry Traffic Collector Function Pack (mandatory)
Cisco Crosswork Telemetry Traffic Collector Function Pack is installed on the Cisco NSO platform and is used to push services and network configurations to the devices. It utilizes Cisco NSO Reactive FastMap (RFM) nano services to manage the telemetry configuration on devices. This is primarily used for dial-out MDT collection.
2.0.0
