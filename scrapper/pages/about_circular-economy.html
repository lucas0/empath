About Cisco
Circular Economy
We are committed to moving from a linear economy, where products are used and then thrown away, to a circular economy that makes better use of our limited natural resources.

Why a circular economy matters
As a society, we are using more natural resources than our planet can regenerate. We can't keep taking without giving. A circular economy looks beyond the current take-make-waste model and aims to redefine growth by focusing on positive society-wide benefits.
Cisco's approach
Our holistic approach extends from how we design, build, and deliver products, to how we value the assets we have and turn them into new products. We also apply Cisco technology to support our customers in their own circular transformations.

Sustainability across the product lifecycle
As we journey to net zero by 2040, we're embedding circularity across the product lifecycle—from how we design, make, and deliver our products, to promoting their sustainable use and reuse.
From linear to circular
Commitment to 100% product return
At the World Economic Forum in January 2018, Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins and eight other tech executives signed the Capital Equipment Pledge, in which Cisco committed to 100 percent product return.
