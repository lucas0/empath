Extensible platform
Our open platform treats infrastructure as code. It extends the functionality of existing management tools through a broad, mature partner ecosystem. IT organizations can transition to DevOps by evolving existing staff, skills, tools, and processes and making them more efficient, to gain TCO savings.
An open API facilitates integration of Cisco UCS Manager with a wide variety of monitoring, analysis, configuration, deployment, and orchestration tools from other independent software vendors. The API also facilitates customer development through the Cisco UCS PowerTool for PowerShell and a Python SDK.
