Redesign of Cisco vManage GUI
From Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1, Cisco vManage GUI is redesigned and offers a new visual display. This section presents a comparative summary of the significant changes between older Cisco vManage releases and Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1 and later.
Changes in Monitor and Tools Menus
Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1 includes the following changes:
The Dashboard menu is removed, and all submenus that were earlier accessible from the Dashboard menu are now part of the Monitor menu.
The Monitor page provides a real-time user interface with a consolidated view of the monitoring information for the components and services of a Cisco SD-WAN overlay network.
Using the pill buttons on the Monitor page, you can navigate to monitoring information for specific components or services of a Cisco SD-WAN overlay network.
The Network Wide Path Insight and On Demand Troubleshooting options that were earlier accessible from the Monitor menu are now part of the Tools menu so that you can easily locate these features.

Support for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Standard
Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1 supports Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 standard for the AA conformance level, with the following limitations:
You cannot exit from SSH terminal using the keyboard.
Cisco vManage cannot skip repetitive navigation links.
Data charts on Cisco vManage use colors as the only visual means of conveying information, which is not compliant with WCAG 2.0.
Some text elements as well as non-text elements in Cisco vManage do not meet the color contrast ratio as defined in WCAG 2.0.
