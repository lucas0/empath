Cisco Hardware Inspection and Software Relicensing Program
The Best Way to Buy Used Cisco Equipment
If you are interested in buying Cisco equipment, you have a number of options. You can buy equipment directly from Cisco or from authorized Cisco resellers. You can buy equipment new or used. Cisco hardware may be freely resold or leased.
However, there are issues to consider before you buy used or "secondary market" equipment. (Secondary-market equipment is equipment purchased from a seller that is not an authorized Cisco reseller.)
The embedded Cisco software that runs on the hardware—as well as Cisco standalone software—is not transferable unless specifically allowed under the Cisco Software License Transfer and Re-Use Policy. If you purchase used or secondary-market Cisco equipment, you must acquire a new license from Cisco before the software can be used.
Used and secondary-market equipment is not covered under the Cisco standard warranty. Nor can you place it under a Cisco service and support contract unless it is relicensed by Cisco and has passed our inspection.
We can help you buy used or secondary-market Cisco equipment with confidence. In the Cisco Hardware Inspection and Software Relicensing Program, we inspect the equipment and relicense the software. Leasing companies that want to re-lease a Cisco product to another customer after the original lease term has expired can also participate in the program.
This program protects Cisco intellectual property, and it protects your network. You can be assured that the equipment is in proper condition, that it is running the safest and most appropriate software, and that it can deliver the full value you expect.(Note: If you do not wish to go through the relicensing and inspecting of used or secondary-market equipment, you can buy refurbished equipment for 25 to 75 percent off the original list price through Cisco Refresh. For more information, visit: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/remanufactured.html.)
This page provides an overview of the Cisco policies governing used and secondary-market equipment and software relicensing. In the section "Using the Program," you will find the steps you take to have Cisco products relicensed and inspected.
To take advantage of the Cisco Hardware Inspection and Software Relicensing Program, please contact your Cisco account manager or service account manager, or email the request to tss-inspections@cisco.com.
Policies Using the Program Product List Frequently Asked Questions
Software
Cisco software—whether it is embedded operating system software or standalone application software—is not transferable unless specifically allowed under the Cisco Software License Transfer and Re-Use Policy. You must have Cisco's written consent and pay a license fee. After a transfer, the previous owner’s license to the software is terminated, and the transferee’s use of the software is governed by the Cisco End User License Agreement and in accordance with the original license entitlement.
This Software License Transfer and Re-Use Policy applies to all Cisco software, whether standalone, embedded software on hardware that is resold or on equipment that is re-leased to a new customer after the original lease term expired. Certain exceptions to the Policy requirement to pay a new license fee apply. They include:
Transfers to an affiliate
Transfers due to a merger, acquisition or divestiture
Financed software (for example, an original lessee may wish to buy equipment from the finance company during or at the end of the lease term)
Sale of Cisco customer premises equipment to an end user by a managed service provider (provided that specific conditions are met)
Outsourcing arrangements
Transfers from US Government Prime Contractors to a new contractor
Transfers within Europe
For more details visit the Cisco Software License Transfer and Re-Use Policy.
Used and Secondary-Market Equipment
The Cisco standard warranty and Cisco service and support contracts are not transferable. That means that any purchase of used or secondary-market Cisco equipment is not covered by the Cisco standard warranty and is not eligible for coverage by a Cisco support contract even if it is purchased through a Cisco channel partner or distributor.
Before used or secondary-market equipment can be placed under a new support contract, the requester must show proof of a valid software license and must have the equipment inspected to confirm that it is in proper working order and has been maintained appropriately. For more details visit the Non-Entitlement to Cisco Warranty and Service Support of Secondary Market Products Policy.
Cisco Refresh (Certified Remanufactured Equipment)
Customers who are interested in used or secondary-market Cisco equipment, but who do not wish to go through the process of relicensing and inspection, can buy remanufactured products through Cisco Refresh. For more information, visit: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/remanufactured.html.
