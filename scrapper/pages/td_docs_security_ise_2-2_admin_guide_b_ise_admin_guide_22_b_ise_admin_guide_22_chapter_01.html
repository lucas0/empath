Menu Drop-downs
Context Visibility: The context visibility windows display information about endpoints, users, and network access devices (NAD). The context visibility information is segmented by features, applications, Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), and other categories, depending on the licenses you have registered. The context visibility windows use a central database and gather information from database tables, caches, and buffers. As a result, the content in the context visibility dashlets and lists updates quickly. The context visibility windows consist of dashlets at the top, and a list of information at the bottom. When you filter data by modifying the column attributes in the list, the dashlets refresh to display the modified content.
Policy: Policy windows include tools for managing network security in the areas of authentication, authorization, profiling, posture, and client provisioning.
Administration: Administration windows include tools for managing Cisco ISE nodes, licenses, certificates, network devices, users, endpoints, and guest services.

Cisco ISE Home Dashboards
The Cisco ISE Home dashboard displays live consolidated and correlated statistical data that is essential for effective monitoring and troubleshooting. Dashboard elements typically display activity over 24 hours. The following figure is an example of the information available in a Cisco ISE dashboard. You can view the Cisco ISE dashboard data only in the primary Policy Administration node (PAN) portal.
Figure 2. Cisco ISE Home Dashboard
The home page has five default dashboards that display your Cisco ISE data. Each of these dashboards has several predefined dashlets.
Summary: This dashboard contains a linear metrics dashlet, pie chart dashlets, and list dashlets. The metrics dashlet is not configurable. By default this dashboard contains the dashletsStatus Endpoints, Endpoint Categories, and Network Devices.
Endpoints: By default, this dashboard contains the dashlets Status, Endpoints, Endpoint Categories, and Network Devices.
Guests: This dashboard contains dashlets that provide information on guest user type, log in failures, and location of acitivity.
Vulnerability: This dashboard displays the information that vulnerability servers report to Cisco ISE.
Threat: This dashboard displays information from the threat servers reports sent to Cisco ISE.
Configuring Home Dashboards
You can customize a home page dashboard by clicking the Gear icon in the top right corner of the window:
Figure 3. Customize A Dashboard
The following options are displayed in the drop-down list:
Add New Dashboard allows you to add a new dashboard. Enter a value in the field that is displayed and click Apply.
Add Dashlet(s) displays a dialog box with a list of dashlets available. Click Add or Remove next to the dashlet name to add or remove a dashlet from the dashboard.
Export saves the selected home page view to a PDF.
Layout Template configures the number of columns that are displayed in this view.
Manage Dashboards contains two options:
Mark As Default Dashboard: Choose this option to make the current dashboard the default view when you choose Home.
Reset All Dashboards: Use this option to also reset all the dashboards and remove your configurations on all the Home dashboards.
Context Visibility Views
The structure of a Context Visibility window is similar to the home page, except that the Context Visibility windows:
Retain your current context (browser window) when you filter the displayed data
Are more customizable
Focus on endpoint data
You can view the context visibility data only from the primary PAN.
Dashlets on the Context Visibility windows show information about endpoints, and endpoint connections to NADs. The information currently displayed is based on the content in the list of data below the dashlets on each window. Each window displays endpoint data, based on the name of the tab. As you filter the data, both the list and dashlets update. You can filter the data by clicking on parts of one or more of the circular graphs, by filtering rows on the table, or any combination those actions. As you select filters, the effects are additive, also referred to as cascading filter, which allows you to drill down to find the particular data you are looking for. You can also click an endpoint in the list, and get a detailed view of that endpoint.
There are three main views under Context Visibility:
Endpoints: Filter the endpoints you want to view based on types of devices, compliance status, authentication type, and more.

Note
We recommend that you enable the accounting settings on the network access devices (NADs) to ensure that the accounting start and update information is sent to Cisco ISE.
Cisco ISE can collect accounting information, such as the latest IP address, status of the session (Connected, Disconnected, or Rejected), the number of days an endpoint has been inactive, only if accounting is enabled. This information is displayed in the Live Logs, Live Sessions and Context Visibility windows in the Cisco ISE administration portal. When accounting is disabled on a NAD, there might be a missing, incorrect, or mismatched accounting information between the Live Sessions, Live Logs and Context Visibility windows.

Note
The Visibility Setup workflow that is available on the Cisco ISE administration portal home page allows you to add a list of IP address ranges for endpoints discovery. After this workflow is configured, Cisco ISE authenticates the endpoints, but the endpoints that are not included in the configured IP address ranges are not displayed in the Context Visibility > Endpoints window and the Endpoints listing page (Work Centers > Network Access > Identities > Endpoints).
Users: Displays user-based information from user identity sources.
If there is a change in the username or password attribute, it reflects in the Users window when there is a change in the authentication status.
If the username is changed in the Microsoft Active Directory, the updated change is displayed in the Users window immediately after re-authentication.
If any other attributes such as Email, Phone, Department, etc are changed in the Microsoft Active Directory, the updated attributes are displayed in the Users window 24 hours after re-authentication.

Note
Updating User Attributes from AD depends on the interval configured under Active Directory Probe. For more information, see Active Directory Probe.
Network Devices: This window displays the list of NADs that have endpoints connected to them. For any NAD, click the number of endpoints that is displayed in the corresponding # of endpoints column. A window that lists all the devices filtered by that NAD is displayed.

Note
If you have configured your network device with SNMPv3 parameters, you cannot generate the Network Device Session Status Summary report that is provided by the Cisco ISE monitoring service (Operations > Reports > Catalog > Network Device > Session Status Summary). You can generate this report successfully if your network device is configured with SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c parameters.
You can create a new tab in the Context Visibility windows and create a custom list for additional filtering. Dashlets are not supported in custom views.
Click a section of a circular graph in a dashlet to view a new window with filtered data from that dashlet in. From this new window, you can continue to filter the displayed data, as described in Filtering Displayed Data in a View.
For more information about using Context Visibility windows to find endpoint data, see the following Cisco YouTube video which uses ISE 2.1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvonGhrydfg.

Dashlets
The following image is an example of a dashlet:
The stacked window symbol “detaches”,Open New Window icon opens this dashlet in a new browser window. The pie chart refreshes. Click the X to delete this dashlet. This option is only available on the home page. You delete dashlets in Context Visibility windows using the gear symbol in the top-right corner of the screen.
Some dashlets have different categories of data. Click the category to see a pie chart with that set of data.
The pie chart shows the data that you have selected. Click one of the pie segments to open a new tab in with the filtered data, based on that pie segment.
Click a section of the pie chart in a home page dashboard to open the chart in a new browser window. The new window displays data that is filtered by the section of the pie chart that you clicked on.
When you click a section of the pie chart in a Context Visibility window, the displayed data is filtered but context does not change. You view the filtered data in the same browser window.
Filtering Displayed Data in a View
When you click a dashlet in a Context Visibility window, the corresponding data is filtered by the item you click and displayed. For example, when you click a section of a pie chart, the data for the chosen section is filtered and displayed.
If you click mobil…vices in the Endpoints dashlet, the window refreshes to disaplay two Endpoints dashlets, a Network Devices dashlet, and a list of data. The dashlets and list show data for mobile devices, as shown in the following examplea new window displays the data, as shown in the following image:
You can continue to filter data by clicking more sections of the pie charts, or by using the controls on the list of data.
The gear icon filters the displayed columns. From the drop-down list, choose the columns that you want to view in this dashboard’s list.
The Quick Filter is displayed by default. Enter characters into the box (label number 3) to filter the list based on the result. The Custom Filter provides a more granular filter, as shown in the following image:
Save your custom filters.
Endpoint Actions in Dashlet Views
The toolbar at the top of the list allows you to act on endpoints in the list that you select. Not all actions are enabled for every list. Some actions depend on the feature that is enabled for use. The following list shows two endpoint actions that must be enabled in Cisco ISE before you can use them.
Adaptive Network Control Actions
If you enable the Adaptive Network Control service, you can select endpoints in the list and assign or revoke network access. You can also issue a change of authorization.
Enable the Adaptive Network Services or Endpoint Protection Services in Cisco ISE in the Adaptive Network Service window. In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and chooseAdministration > System > Settings > Endpoint Protection Service > Adaptive Network Control. For more information, see Enable Adaptive Network Control in Cisco ISE.
When you click the pie chart on a home page dashlet, the new window that is displayed contains the options ANC and Change Authorization. Check the check box for the endpoint you want to perform an action on, and choose the necessary action from the drop-down lists ofANC and Change Authorization.

MDM Actions
If you connect an MDM server to Cisco ISE, you can perform MDM actions on selected endpoints. Choose the necessary action from the MDM Actions drop-down list.
Attributes in Context Visibility
The systems and services that provide attributes for Context Visibility sometimes have different values for the same attribute name. The following are a few examples:
For Operating System
OperatingSystem: Posture operating system.
operating-system: NMAP operating system.
operating-system-result: Profiler consolidated operating system.

Note
There might be some discrepancies in the endpoint operating system data that is displayed in the Context Visibility window when you enable multiple probes in Cisco ISE for an endpoint.

Portal.Name: Guest portal name when device registration is turned on.
PortalName: Guest portal name when device registration is not turned on.
For Portal User
User-Name: Username from RADIUS authentication.
GuestUserName: Guest username.
PortalUser: Portal username.
Cisco ISE Internationalization and Localization
Cisco ISE internationalization adapts the user interface to the supported languages. Localization of the user interface incorporates location-specific components and translated text. In Windows, MAC OSX, and Android devices, the native supplicant provisioning wizard can be used in any of the following supported languages.
In Cisco ISE, internalization and localization support focuses on support for non-English text in UTF-8 encoding to the end user-facing portals and on selective fields in the administration portal.
Supported Languages
End-User Web Portal Localization
Support for UTF-8 Character Data Entry
Supported Languages
Cisco ISE provides localization and internalization support for the following languages and browser locales.

End-User Web Portal Localization
The Guest, Sponsor, My Devices, and Client Provisioning portals are localized into all the supported languages and locales. This includes text, labels, messages, field names, and button labels. If a client browser requests a locale that is not mapped to a template in Cisco ISE, the portal displays content using the English template.
Using the administration portal, you can modify the fields that are used in the Guest, Sponsor, and My Devices portals for each language. You can also add other languages. Currently, you cannot customize these fields for the Client Provisioning portal.
You can further customize the Guest portal by uploading HTML pages to Cisco ISE. When you upload customized pages, you are responsible for the appropriate localization support for your deployment. Cisco ISE provides a localization support example with sample HTML pages, which you can use as a guide. Cisco ISE allows you to upload, store, and render custom internationalized HTML pages.

Note
NAC and MAC agent installers, and WebAgent pages are not localized.
Support for UTF-8 Character Data Entry
Cisco ISE fields that are exposed to the end user (through the Cisco client agent or supplicants, or the Sponsor, Guest, My Devices, and Client Provisioning portals) support UTF-8 character sets for all languages. UTF-8 is a multibyte character encoding for the Unicode character set, which includes many different language character sets including Hebrew, Sanskrit, and Arabic.
Character values are stored in UTF-8 in the administration configuration database, and the UTF-8 characters display correctly in reports and user interface components.
UTF-8 Credential Authentication
UTF-8 Policies and Posture Assessment
Cisco NAC and MAC Agent UTF-8 Support
UTF-8 Support for Messages Sent to Supplicant
Reports and Alerts UTF-8 Support
UTF-8 Character Support in the Portals
UTF-8 Support Outside the Cisco ISE User Interface
Support for Importing and Exporting UTF-8 Values
UTF-8 Support on REST
UTF-8 Support for Identity Stores Authorization Data
UTF-8 Credential Authentication
Network access authentication supports UTF-8 username and password credentials. This includes RADIUS, Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), RADIUS proxy, RADIUS token, and web authentication from the Guest and administration portal login authentications. UTF-8 support for username and password applies to authentication against the local identity store and external identity stores.
UTF-8 authentication depends on the client supplicant that is used for network login. Some Windows native supplicants do not support UTF-8 credentials.

Note
UTF-8 authentication with RSA is not supported as RSA does not support UTF-8 users. RSA servers, which are compatible with Cisco ISE, also do not support UTF-8.
UTF-8 Policies and Posture Assessment
Policy rules in Cisco ISE that are conditioned on attribute values may include UTF-8 text. Rule evaluation supports UTF-8 attribute values. You can also configure conditions with UTF-8 values through the administration portal.
Posture requirements are modified as File, Application, and Service conditions based on a UTF-8 character set. This includes sending UTF-8 requirement values to the NAC agent. The NAC agent then assesses the endpoint accordingly, and reports UTF-8 values when applicable.
Cisco NAC and MAC Agent UTF-8 Support
The Cisco NAC agent supports the internationalization of text, messages, and any UTF-8 data that is exchanged with Cisco ISE. This includes requirement messages, requirement names, and file and process names that are used in conditions.
The following limitations apply:
UTF-8 support applies to Windows-based NAC agents only.
Cisco NAC and MAC agent interfaces currently do not support localization.
WebAgent does not support UTF-8-based rules and requirements.
If an acceptable use policy (AUP) is configured, the policy pages are provided on the client side, based on the browser locale and the set of languages that are specified in the configuration. You are responsible for providing a localized AUP bundle or site URL.
UTF-8 Support for Messages Sent to Supplicant
RSA prompts and messages are forwarded to the supplicant using a RADIUS attribute REPLY-MESSAGE, or within EAP data. If the text contains UTF-8 data, it is displayed by the supplicant, based on the client’s local operating system language support. Some Windows-native supplicants do not support UTF-8 credentials.
Cisco ISE prompts and messages may not be in synchrony with the locale of the client operating system on which the supplicant is running. You must align the end-user supplicant locale with the languages that are supported by Cisco ISE.
Reports and Alerts UTF-8 Support
Monitoring and troubleshooting reports and alerts support UTF-8 values for relevant attributes for the languages that are supported in Cisco ISE. The following activities are supported:
Viewing live authentications.
Viewing detailed pages of report records.
Exporting and saving reports.
Viewing the Cisco ISE dashboard.
Viewing alert information.
Viewing tcpdump data.
UTF-8 Character Support in the Portals
More character sets are supported in Cisco ISE fields (UTF-8) than are currently supported for localizations in portals and end-user messages. For example, Cisco ISE does not support right-to-left languages, such as Hebrew or Arabic, although the character sets themselves are supported.
The following table lists the fields in the Admin and end-user portals that support UTF-8 characters for data entry and viewing, with the following limitations:
Cisco ISE does not support guest usernames and passwords with UTF-8 characters.
Cisco ISE does not support UTF-8 characters in certificates.

The passwords can contain any combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters (including !, @, #, $, ^, &, *, (, and ). The password field accepts any characters including UTF-8 characters, but it does not accept control characters.
Some languages do not have uppercase or lowercase alphabets. If your user password policy requires the user to enter a password with uppercase or lowercase characters and the user’s language does not support these characters, the user cannot set a password. For the user password field to support UTF-8 characters, uncheck the following check boxes in the user password policy page (Administration > Identity Management > Settings > User Authentication Settings > Password Policy):
Lowercase alphabetic characters
Uppercase alphabetic characters
You cannot use dictionary words, their characters in reverse order, or their letters replaced with other characters.

UTF-8 Support Outside the Cisco ISE User Interface
This section contains the areas outside the Cisco ISE user interface that provide UTF-8 support.
Debug Log and CLI-Related UTF-8 Support
Attribute values and posture condition details appear in some debug logs. All debug logs accept UTF-8 values. You can download debug logs containing raw UTF-8 data that can be viewed with a UTF-8-supported viewer.
Cisco Secure ACS Migration UTF-8 Support
Cisco ISE allows the migration of Cisco Secure Access Control Server (ACS) UTF-8 configuration objects and values. Migration of some UTF-8 objects may not be supported by Cisco ISE UTF-8 languages, which might render some of the UTF-8 data that is provided during migration unreadable using the administration portal or report methods. Convert the unreadable UTF-8 values (that are migrated from Cisco Secure ACS) into ASCII text. For more information about migrating from Cisco Secure ACS to Cisco ISE, see the Cisco Secure ACS to Cisco ISE Migration Tool for your version of Cisco ISE.
Support for Importing and Exporting UTF-8 Values
The administration and Sponsor portals support plaintext and CSV files with the UTF-8 values to use when importing user account details. Exported files are provided as CSV files.
UTF-8 Support on REST
External Representational State Transfer (REST) communication supports UTF-8 values. This applies to configurable items that have UTF-8 support in the Cisco ISE user interface, except for administrator authentication. Administrator authentication in REST requires ASCII text credentials for login.
UTF-8 Support for Identity Stores Authorization Data
Cisco ISE allows Microsoft Active Directory and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to use UTF- 8 data in authorization policies for policy processing.
MAC Address Normalization
Cisco ISE supports normalization of the MAC address that you enter in any of the following formats:
00-11-22-33-44-55
0011.2233.4455
00:11:22:33:44:55
001122334455
001122-334455
Provide full or partial MAC addresses in the following Cisco ISE windows:
Policy > Authorization
Policy > Policy Elements > Conditions > Authorization
Authentications > Filters (Endpoint and Identity columns)
Global search
Operations > Reports > Report Filters
Operations > Troubleshoot > Diagnostic Tools > General Tools > Endpoint Debug
Provide full MAC addresses (six octets separated by ‘:’ or ‘-’ or ‘.’) in the following Cisco ISE windows:
Operations > Endpoint Protection Services Adaptive Network Control
Operations > Troubleshoot > Diagnostic Tools > General Tools > RADIUS Authentication Troubleshooting
Operations > Troubleshooting > Diagnostic Tools > General Tools > Posture Troubleshooting
Administration > Identities > Endpoints
Administration > System > Deployment
Administration > Logging > Collection Filters
REST APIs also support normalization of full MAC address.
The valid ranges for an octet are 0 to 9, a to f, or A to F.
