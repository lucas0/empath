Introduction
This document provides a sample configuration of a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Virtual Private Network (VPN) over ATM when Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is present on the customer side, with area 0.

Conventions
For more information on document conventions, see the Cisco Technical Tips Conventions.
The letters below represent the different types of routers and switches used:
P: Provider's core router
PE: Provider's edge router
CE: Customer's edge router
C: Customer's router
This diagram shows a typical configuration using these conventions:
Prerequisites
There are no specific prerequisites for this document.
Components Used
The information in this document is based on the software and hardware versions below.
PE routers:
Software - Cisco IOS® Software Release 12.1(3)T . The MPLS VPN features appear in Release 12.0(5)T. The OSPF as PE-CE routing protocol appears in Release 12.0(7)T.
Hardware - The Cisco 3660 or 7206 routers. For details of other hardware you can use, refer to the Designing MPLS for ATM guide.
CE routers: Any router able to exchange routing information with its PE router can be used.
P routers and switches: The MPLS VPN integration function resides only on the edge of the MPLS network, so any MPLS-capable switch can be used. In this sample configuration, the MPLS cloud is composed of an 8540 Multiservice ATM Switch Router (MSR) and a LightStream 1010. If you are using the Cisco LightStream 1010, we recommend that you use software version WA4.8d or later. You can also use other ATM switches like the Cisco BPX 8650 or MGX 8850 in the ATM core network.
The information presented in this document was created from devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If you are working in a live network, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command before using it.
Background Theory
The VPN feature, when used with MPLS, allows several sites to transparently interconnect through a service provider's network. One service provider network can support several different IP VPNs. Each of these appears to its users as a private network, separate from all other networks. Within a VPN, each site can send IP packets to any other site in the same VPN.
Each VPN is associated with one or more VPN Routing or Forwarding Instances (VRFs). A VRF consists of an IP routing table, a derived Cisco Express Forwarding (EF) table and a set of interfaces that use this forwarding table.
The router maintains a separate routing and Cisco EF table for each VRF. This prevents information being sent outside the VPN and allows the same subnet to be used in several VPNs without causing duplicate IP address problems.
The router using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) distributes the VPN routing information using the BGP extended communities.
For more information regarding the propagation of updates through a VPN, see the following URLs:

MPLS Forwarding
Using OSPF
Traditionally, an elaborate OSPF network consists of a backbone area (area 0) and a number of areas connected to this backbone through an Area Border Router (ABR).
By using an MPLS backbone for VPN with OSPF on the customer's site, you can introduce a third level in the hierarchy of the OSPF model. This third level is called the MPLS VPN Super Backbone.
In simple cases, the MPLS VPN Super Backbone is combined with the traditional area 0 backbone. This means that there is no area 0 backbone on the customer network, since the MPLS VPN Super Backbone plays the same role as the area 0 backbone. This is shown in the diagram below:
In this diagram:
The PE routers are ABR and Autonomous System Boundary Routers (ASBR).
The CE routers are simple OSPF routers.
The VPN information is transported using BGP extended communities from PEs to other PEs and is re-injected into the OSPF areas as Summary Network (type 3) Link-State Advertisements (LSAs).
The MPLS VPN Super Backbone also enables customers to use multiple area 0 backbones on their sites. Each site can have a separate area 0 as long as it is connected to the MPLS VPN Super Backbone. The result is the same as a partitioned area 0 backbone. This is shown in the diagram below:
In this case:
The PE routers are ABR and ASBR routers.
The CE routers are ABR routers.
The LSAs containing VPN information are transported using BGP extended communities from PEs to other PEs. In Summary Network (type 3) LSAs, information is transported between PEs and CEs.
This sample configuration is based on the second setup shown above. You can find a sample configuration that uses the first setup in MPLS VPN over ATM: with OSPF on the Customer Side (without Area 0).
OSPF information is transported with BGP extended community attributes (including one that identifies the OSPF network). Each VPN must have its own OSPF process. To specify this, issue the following command:
router ospf <process ID> vrf <VPN routing or forwarding instance name>
Configure
In this section, you are presented with the information to configure the features described in this document.
Note: To find additional information on the commands used in this document, use the Command Lookup Tool (registered customers only) .
Network Diagram
This document uses the network setup shown in the diagram below.
Configuration Procedure
The Cisco IOS documentation (MPLS Virtual Private Networks) also describes this configuration procedure.
Part I
Make sure that ip cef is enabled. If you are using a Cisco 7500 router, ensure that ip cef distributed is enabled. On the PEs, once MPLS is set up:
Create one VRF for each VPN connected using the ip vrf <VPN routing/forwarding instance name> command. When doing this:
Issue the command below to specify the correct route distinguisher used for that VPN. This is used to extend the IP address so that you can identify which VPN it belongs to.
rd <VPN route distinguisher>
Set up the import and export properties for the BGP extended communities. These are used for filtering the import and export process.
route-target [export|import|both] <target VPN extended community>
Configure the forwarding details for the respective interfaces by issuing this command:
ip vrf forwarding <table name>
Remember to set up the IP address after doing this.
Depending on the PE-CE routing protocol you are using, you should now do one or more of the following:
Configure the static routes as follows:
ip route vrf vrf-name prefix mask [next-hop-address] [interface {interface-number}]
Configure the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) by issuing the command:
address-family ipv4 vrf <VPN routing/forwarding instance name>
Once this is done, enter the normal RIP configuration commands.
Note that:
This is only applied to the forwarding interfaces for the current VRF.
It is necessary to redistribute the correct BGP into RIP. When doing this, remember to also specify the metric used.
Declare the BGP neighbor information.
Configure the OSPF by issuing the new Cisco IOS command:
router ospf <process ID> vrf <VPN routing/forwarding instance name>.
Note that:
This is only applied to the forwarding interfaces for the current VRF.
It is necessary to redistribute the correct BGP into OSPF. When doing this, remember to also specify the metric used.
Once the OSPF process is attributed to a VRF, this process number is always used for this particular VRF. This applies even if you do not specify it in the command line.
Part II
Configure BGP between the PE routers. There are several ways to configure BGP, such as using the route reflector or confederation methods. The method used here – direct neighbor configuration – is the simplest and the least scalable.
Declare the different neighbors.
Enter the address-family ipv4 vrf <VPN routing/forwarding instance name> for each VPN present at this PE router. Carry out one or more of the following steps, as necessary:
Redistribute the static routing information.
Redistribute the RIP routing informations.
Redistribute the OSPF routing information.
Activate BGP neighboring with the CE routers.
Enter the address-family vpnv4 Mode, and:
Activate the neighbors.
Specify that extended community must be used. This is mandatory.

MPLS Labels
Confirm that there are two labels on the label stack on the entry Label Switch Router (LSR) as follows:
Alcazaba#show tag-switching forwarding-table vrf vpn1 6.6.7.2 detail 
Local  Outgoing    Prefix            Bytes tag  Outgoing   Next Hop

Now, confirm that they appear on the exit LSR:

Test Commands
You can now issue the ping command to test that everything is fine:
Ischia#ping 222.0.0.11
 
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 222.0.0.11, timeout is 2 seconds:
!!!!!
Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 1/3/4 ms
Ischia#trac
Ischia#traceroute 222.0.0.11
 
Type escape sequence to abort.
