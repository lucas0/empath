Introduction
This document describes the steps you need to follow to open a case for Crosswork Network Insights (CNI), Crosswork Trust Insights (CTI), or Crosswork Traffic Analysis (CTA). The process is slightly different because service contracts, licenses, and product identification (serial number) are not managed in the same manner that they are managed for other Cisco products.

Step 12. Support Case Manager limits you to submitting low severity cases. The CX group is notified of the issue and a Service Engineer responds using the preferred contact information provided in the case.
