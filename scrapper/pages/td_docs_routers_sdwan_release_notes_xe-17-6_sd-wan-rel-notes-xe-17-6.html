Feature Description
Cisco SD-WAN Getting Started
Quick Connect Workflow for Onboarding Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices
This feature provides an alternative, guided method in Cisco vManage to onboard supported WAN edge devices into the Cisco SD-WAN overlay network. As part of the Quick Connect workflow, basic day-0 configuration profiles are created, which apply to all Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices, irrespective of the device model and device family. This workflow adds edge devices to the WAN transport and establishes data plane and control plane connections.
This feature is supported on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices only.
Cisco vManage Persona-based Cluster Configuration
Simplifies adding Cisco vManage servers to a cluster by identifying servers based on personas. A persona defines what services run on a server.
Support for Reverse Proxy with Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices and Cisco SD-WAN Multitenancy
With this feature, you can deploy a reverse proxy device in your overlay network between Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices and Cisco vManage and Cisco vSmart Controllers. Also, this feature enables you to deploy a reverse proxy device in both single-tenant and multitenant overlays that include Cisco vEdge or Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN edge devices.
Support for License Management Offline Mode and Compliance Alarms
With this feature, you can manage Cisco SD-WAN licenses through a Cisco vManage instance that is not connected to the internet. To synchronize license and compliance information between Cisco vManage and Cisco SSM, you must periodically download synchronization files from Cisco vManage and upload the files to Cisco SSM.
This feature also introduces compliance alarms that alert you if devices in the Cisco SD-WAN network are not yet licensed.
Cisco SD-WAN Systems and Interfaces
RBAC for Policies
This feature allows you to create users and user groups with required read and write permissions for Cisco vManage policies. RBAC for policies provides users with the access to all the details of policies to help maximize the operational efficiency. It makes it easier to meet configuration requirements and guarantees that authorized users on the system are only given access to what they need.
Implicit ACL on Loopback Interfaces
This feature allows you to configure implicit ACL on loopback interfaces.
You can filter and manage data traffic by configuring implicit ACL on loopback interfaces instead of using the physical WAN interface. This saves public IP address space.
Geofencing
This feature provides a way to restrict a device's location to an operational geographical boundary, and to identify a device's location and report any violations of the configured boundary. If the device is identified to be in violation, you can restrict network access to the device using Cisco vManage operational commands.
In the CLI or a CLI template, configure geofencing coordinates for establishing the location of the device. You can also register for SMS alerts.
Cisco SD-WAN EtherChannel
This feature allows you to configure EtherChannels on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices in service-side VPN.
An EtherChannel provides fault-tolerant high speed link, redundancy, and increased bandwidth between Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices and other devices such as routers, switches, or servers connected in a network.
You can configure EtherChannels only using the CLI device templates and CLI add-on feature templates.
Tenant Device Forecasting
With this feature, a service provider can control the number of WAN edge devices a tenant can add to their overlay network. By doing so, the provider can utilize Cisco SD-WAN controller resources efficiently.
Migrate Multitenant Cisco SD-WAN Overlay
This feature enables you to migrate a multitenant Cisco SD-WAN overlay comprising shared Cisco vManage instances and Cisco vBond Orchestrators, and tenant-specific Cisco vSmart Controllers to a multitenant overlay comprising shared Cisco vManage instances, Cisco vBond Orchestrators, and Cisco vSmart Controllers.
Cisco SD-WAN Support for Carrier Supporting Carrier Connectivity
The feature adds support for carrier supporting carrier (CSC) connectivity on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
CSC enables you to interconnect IP or multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) networks operating at different sites over an MPLS backbone network. Using CSC requires an edge router that supports CSC functionality, called a carrier edge (CE) device, at each site. This feature enables a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device to serve as a CE device, making it unnecessary to have a separate dedicated CE device at each site managed by Cisco SD-WAN.
Wireless Management on Cisco 1000 Series Integrated Services Routers
This feature enables you to configure wireless LAN settings on Cisco 1000 Series Integrated Services using Cisco vManage.
With Cisco vManage, you can automate the wireless LAN controller configuration and provide wireless connectivity without the need of another external controller to configure and manage wireless settings on the routers.
Extended Visibility with Cisco SD-WAN and Cisco ThousandEyes
You can deploy Cisco ThousandEyes Enterprise agent natively as a container application on eligible Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices to integrate Cisco SD-WAN with Cisco ThousandEyes. You can install and activate the Cisco ThousandEyes Enterprise agent through Cisco vManage.
By integrating Cisco SD-WAN with Cisco ThousandEyes, you can gain granular insights into network and application performance with full hop-by-hop path analysis across the Internet, and isolate fault domains for expedited troubleshooting and resolution.
Cisco SD-WAN Routing
Radio-Aware Routing Support
This feature enables Radio-Aware Routing (RAR) support on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. RAR is a mechanism that uses radios to interact with the routing protocol OSPFv3 to signal the appearance, disappearance, and link conditions of one-hop routing neighbors. In a large mobile networks, connections to the routing neighbors are interrupted due to distance and radio obstructions. RAR addresses the challenges faced when merging IP routing and radio communications in mobile networks.
Redistribution of Replicated Routes to BGP, OSPF, and EIGRP Protocols
This feature allows you to configure the following:
- Redistribution of leaked or replicated routes between the global VRF and service VPNs for BGP, OSPF, and EIGRP protocols on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices
- OMP administrative distance option to prefer OMP routes over MPLS routes
- VRRP tracking to track whether a leaked route is reachable
Cisco SD-WAN Policies
SLA Class Support Enhancement
This feature is an enhancement to support more than six SLA classes per policy on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
Application-aware Routing and Data Policy SLA Preferred Colors
This feature provides different behaviors to choose preferred colors based on the SLA requirements when both application-aware routing policy and data policies are configured.
Flexible NetFlow Enhancement
This feature enhances Flexible NetFlow to collect type of service (ToS), sampler ID and remarked DSCP values in netflow records. This enhancement provides the flexibility to define flow record fields to customize flow records by defining flow record fields. The ToS and remarked DSCP fields are supported only on IPv4 records. However, the sampler ID field is supported for both IPv4 and IPv6 records.
Cisco SD-WAN Security
Unified Security Policy
This feature allows you to configure a single unified security policy for firewall and UTD security features such as IPS, Cisco URL Filtering, AMP, and TLS/SSL.
Having a single unified security policy simplifies policy configuration and enforcement as firewall and UTD policies can be configured together in a single security operation rather than as individual policies.
Authentication Types
The authentication types supported from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a differ from the authentication types supported in Cisco IOS XE Release 17.5.1a and earlier releases. For a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device running Cisco IOS XE Release 17.5.1a or earlier, if you have configured authentication types using the Cisco Security feature template, you must update the the authentication types in the template after you upgrade the device software to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a or later.
To update the authentication types, do the following:
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Templates.
Click Feature Templates.
Find the Cisco Security template to update and click … and click Edit.
Click Update. Do not modify any configuration.
Cisco vManage updates the Cisco Security template to display the supported authentication types.
Cisco SD-WAN Cloud OnRamp
Support for Cloud OnRamp for SaaS Probing through VPN 0 Interfaces at Gateway Sites
Cloud OnRamp for SaaS tests the performance of (probes) routing paths to find the best routing path for specific cloud application traffic. Using the best routing path for the traffic of a cloud application optimizes the performance of the application.
This feature enables Cloud OnRamp for SaaS to probe through VPN 0 interfaces at gateway sites as part of determining the best path to use for the traffic of specified cloud applications. This extends the best path probing to include more of the available interfaces connected to the internet.
Using this feature, Cloud OnRamp for SaaS can probe interfaces at a gateway site, whether they use service VPNs (VPN 1, VPN 2, and so on) or the transport VPN (VPN 0). This is helpful when a branch site connects to the internet, exclusively or in part, through a gateway site that uses a VPN 0 interface to connect to the internet.
Cloud onRamp for SaaS over SIG Tunnels
This feature allows you to connect to Cloud onRamp for SaaS by means of a SIG tunnel.
Cloud onRamp for SaaS over SIG tunnels provides you secure access to the SaaS applications, and the capability to automatically select the best possible SIG tunnel for accessing the SaaS applications.
Routing Traffic Flow to a Virtual Hub Firewall or a Local Firewall
This feature enables you to route Microsoft Azure Virtual WAN hub traffic to a firewall on a local branch router, or direct local branch traffic to an Azure secured virtual hub, to be subject to the security policies of the Azure Firewall Manager.
Cisco SD-WAN and Google Service Directory Integration and Support for Cloud State Audit and Cloud Resource Inventory
With the integration of Google Service Directory with the Cisco SD-WAN solution, you can discover your applications in the Google cloud using Cisco vManage. You can use the discovered applications to define application-aware routing policies in Cisco vManage.
The Audit feature in Cisco vManage is now extended to Google Cloud integration. Use this option to ensure that the states of the objects in Google Cloud stay in sync with Cisco vManage state.
Cloud Resource Inventory in Cisco vManage retrieves a detailed list of your cloud objects, their identifiers, the timestamps when such objects were created, and so on.

The default topology is full mesh, but the hub and spoke topology is often used for IoT applications.
Cisco SD-WAN support on the Cisco IR1101 Integrated Services Router Rugged requires Cisco IOS-XE Release 16.12.
The Cisco IR1101 Integrated Services Router Rugged has four fixed switch-ports. Make sure to select the correct template.
The CLI template is not currently supported.
Starting from Cisco IOS-XE Release 16.12.1, Cisco IR1101 Integrated Services Router Rugged has dual LTE support with LTE extension module.
We recommend using up to 50 BFD sessions for scaling.
Important Notes, Known Behavior, and Workaround
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices with the SFP-10G-SR module do not support online insertion and removal (OIR) of this module.
Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1 implements a hardened security posture to comply with FedRamp guidelines. As a result, your vAnalytics login credentials that are stored locally get erased on upgrading the software, and you cannot access the vAnalytics service directly through Cisco vManage. In this case, log in to vAnalytics using this URL: https://analytics.viptela.com. If you can’t find your vAnalytics login credentials, open a case with Cisco TAC support.
Starting from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.5.1a, the table keyword is added to all show sdwan commands for which the output needs to be displayed in a tabular format. Using | tab is restricted for all Cisco SD-WAN commands starting from Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Release 16.11.x.
Starting from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.3a, the upgrade considerations are updated for auto-negotiation support. For more information on this, see Upgrade Considerations.
