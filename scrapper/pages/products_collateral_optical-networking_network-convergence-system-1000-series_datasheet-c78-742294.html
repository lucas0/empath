    NCS 1001 provides unmatched levels of automation and visibility for point-to-point metro optical line systems. Cisco has enhanced this further with the introduction of inline and real-time OTDR-based reporting. The OTDR line card will allow users to scan the fiber at will to profile fiber loss and detect ORL, reflection, and attenuation events.
Product features and benefits
The Cisco® NCS 1001 OTDR Line Card (Figure 1) occupies one slot in the 1RU NCS 1001 Line System platform. The module provides two bidirectional OTDRs and corresponding filters to combine the OTDR signals with the OSC and C-Band channels.
Figure 1.

The Cisco NCS 1001 OTDR Line Card provides the following benefits:
●     Bidirectional OTDR up to 100 km. The OTDR operates inline and in real time with no interruption to traffic.
●     Embedded filter for combining OTDR with OSC and C-Band channels.
●     Multiple deployment models can be supported—terminal, ILA, and standalone.
●     Compact one-third of an RU. Up to 6x OTDRs in one RU.
●     Auto-mode and expert modes available depending on what the user requires.

Use cases
The Cisco NCS 1001 OTDR can be used in the following configurations:
●     Terminal node with unprotected or protected amplifiers at the end points of a point-to-point link. Figure 3 illustrates how the OTDR line card connects into a protected terminal node that has two amplifier modules.
●     Inline Amplifier Node with two amplifiers modules—one for each direction. Figure 4 shows how the OTDR line card connects to the two amplifier modules.
●     Standalone for use with any third-party line system.

Management
The Cisco NCS 1001 provides comprehensive management capabilities to support Operations, Administration, Maintenance, and Provisioning (OAM&P) capabilities through IOS-XR CLI, SNMP, Syslog, and XML. For machine-to-machine configuration and management of NCS 1001, NETCONF, RESTCONF, and gRPC transport protocols with JSON, XML, and GPB encoding are provided. OpenConfig protocols for management GNMI and operations GNOI are also supported. The NCS 1001 provides a set of native YANG models as well as the ability to map into any industry standard or customer-defined YANG data models. For monitoring, NCS 1001 provides a streaming telemetry feature that relies on a push mechanism to disseminate user-selected PM and status information at user specified frequencies at granular 10-second intervals. This improves monitoring speed and scale compared to traditional pull-based mechanisms such as SNMP. The telemetry infrastructure also allows for events such as alarms and port-state changes to be notified.
Auto and expert modes
The auto mode allows the user to run a scan measurement without specifying the fiber distance or zone where this measurement has to be performed. The system will automatically tune the granularity of the measurement to provide the best result. The auto mode includes two training phases: ORL training and OTDR training. This training is under system control and occurs without user intervention. Results of the training phases shall be available through show commands.
The expert mode allows the user to have full control over OTDR parameters. The expert mode enables expert users who understand how best to set the configuration parameters, which include reflection sensitivity, loss sensitivity, total loss (dB), capture start point (km), capture end point (km), measurement time (s), pulse width (us), and fiber resolution (m).
Performance monitoring
The Cisco NCS 1001 supports performance monitoring of optical parameters. Calculation and accumulation of the performance-monitoring data are supported in 30-second, 15-minute, and 24-hour intervals as per G.7710.
After each OTDR scan, ORL measured over the span and fiber end are reported, as well as a list of events. Each event type includes measurement information on loss, reflection, location (km), accuracy (m), and magnitude (dB). The system can save up to 50 events in total and 20 last scans for each slot. Measurement data from OTDR scans can also be exported by the user through an .SOR file. Alarms/SYSLOGs are raised for high ORL, reflection, or Loss after a scan. In case an OTDR scan fails, a SYSLOG message is raised with the corresponding reason for the failure.
The NCS 1001 provides a set of port and system LEDs for a quick visual check of the operational status. The various LEDs are described in detail in Table 4.
