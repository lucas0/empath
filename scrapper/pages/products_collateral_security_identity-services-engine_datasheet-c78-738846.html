The Cisco® ISE Passive Identity Connector consolidates multiple sources of authentication data into a single source of truth. It simplifies the installation of Cisco security products, and it offloads work from key infrastructure.
Product Overview
Username is a key element in determining access to a network. Username can also help you alert you users to potentially suspicious activity with their devices. It answers the all-important question of who is connected to your network.
The Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) Passive Identity Connector centralizes, consolidates, and distributes identity information, including IP addresses, MAC addresses, and usernames. At the same time it offloads work from key infrastructure such as Microsoft Active Directory.
Many servers on the network are active participants in user authentication. They take user credentials and either verify them or look them up in a dedicated repository such as Active Directory. Rather than being actively involved in user authentication, the Passive Identity Connector listens to the various authentication servers on the network. It centralizes the authentication information, becoming the single source of truth for its subscribers.
The Passive Identity Connector distributes the session identity information to other devices on the network that are natural consumers of such information. These devices include firewalls, web security appliances, and traffic analyzers. Using the Cisco Platform Exchange Grid (pxGrid), the Cisco ISE Passive Identity Connector can support up to 20 subscribers.
Features and Benefits
Feature
Benefit
Centralized information

Microsoft Active Directory Integration
The Cisco ISE Passive Identity Connector can gather session data from many authentication servers on the network but arguably none is more important than the Microsoft Active Directory. The Passive Identity Connector can gather information from up to 100 domain controllers either using the Microsoft Windows Management Interface (WMI), through a Cisco Active Directory agent installed on each domain controller, through the use of a switched port analyzer (SPAN) port, or through syslog. The Microsoft WMI interface has the advantage of not requiring any additional software to be installed on the domain controllers. The Active Directory agent can gather information from up to 10 domain controllers. It requires no configuration changes on the domain controller and can be installed on either a domain controller or a member server.
For those who want to limit the load on their Active Directory infrastructure or who simply want a quick and easy way to retrieve data without having to configure the Active Directory, the Cisco ISE Passive Identity Connector offers the ability to gather session data through the use of a SPAN port. SPAN sniffs network traffic, specifically examining Kerberos messages. It extracts user identity information also stored by the Active Directory and sends that information to the Passive Identity Connector.
Predefined and User-Definable Syslog Parsers
There are numerous sources of identity on the network and countless ways to interface with them, creating an impossible combination. The Cisco ISE Passive Identity Connector overcomes this challenge by providing a generic syslog parser. Customers can point syslog agents on the authentication servers to the Passive Identity Connector for it to parse out the identity information.
The syslog parser can support both a countless variety of syslog message formats by using regular expressions to tease out the syslog messages containing authentication information. Different header types are also no problem for the Passive Identity Connector, which uses the same regular expression capability for the headers as well. In addition to a generic syslog parser, the Passive Identity Connector provides predefined parsers, including those from Cisco ISE, the Cisco Secure Access Control System (ACS), the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) VPN, Aerohive, BlueCat, Blue Coat, F5 VPN, InfoBlox, Lucent QIP, Nortel VPN, and Safe Connect.
Application Programming Interface
The Cisco ISE Passive Identity Connector provides a custom API for applications that publish session data but not using syslog.
Terminal Server Support
The Cisco ISE Passive Identity Connector provides the ability to gather session information from a Citrix terminal server environment by using an agent installed on the terminal server.
Standalone and High-Availability Configurations
The Cisco ISE Passive Identity Connector can operate standalone or may be paired with a second virtual machine for high availability. The primary updates the secondary in the high-availability configuration operating in an active/passive environment.
Hardware Solutions
Customers looking for a hardware solution from Cisco may purchase the Secure Network Server (SNS) 3515 or 3595 Appliances with Cisco ISE version 2.2 or later. The SNS 3515 can support up to 100,000 sessions, and the SNS 3595 can support up to 300,000 sessions.
Upgrades to ISE
Customers may upgrade from the Cisco ISE Passive Identity Connector to Cisco ISE by adding the Passive Identity Connector node to an existing Cisco ISE cluster. Customers may also upgrade the Passive Identity Connector to a standalone Cisco ISE instance with the appropriate licenses. This is all accomplished through the installation of licenses and does not require any additional software to be installed. You can thus protect your investment as your business needs expand and do so without a substantial investment from the IT staff.
