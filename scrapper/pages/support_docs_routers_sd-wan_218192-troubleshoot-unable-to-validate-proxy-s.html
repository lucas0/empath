Introduction
This document describes the "Failed to update setting Invalid request. unable to validate proxy server" error in vManage and how to resolve it.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:
Cisco Software-defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN)
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
 vManage Version 20.5.1 and above.
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Background Information
In the Cisco vManage 20.5.1, the HTTP/HTTPS communication from the vManage to external systems (PnP Connect, software download, cloud-on-ramp, and so on.) can be channeled through an HTTP/HTTPS proxy server. The proxy server is configured in the vManage > Administration Settings, under HTTP/HTTPS Proxy.
For more information, navigate to: Configure HTTP/HTTPS Proxy Server.
Problem
When the proxy server is configured, the vManage verifies if the proxy server is reachable before the settings are accepted. If the server is not reachable, the vManage throws the error "Failed to update setting Invalid request. unable to validate proxy server <server-ip-or-name>".
The vManage performs the following steps to validate the proxy server:
Resolve the server IP address (if the server is configured with  a FQDN name)
Setup a TCP connection to the proxy server IP address on port 7 (echo protocol). If a response is received from the proxy, then it is reachable
The vManage then uses the proxy with the port number specified in the configuration settings.
Note:  The vManage uses VPN 0 to communicate with the proxy server; the use of VPN 512 is currently not supported and the vManage verifies that the proxy server is reachable every 24 hours.
Solution
For the vManage to validate the proxy server settings, it is necessary to allow the communication from the vManage to the proxy server on port 7 (echo protocol).
