Introduction
This document describes how to workaround the problem with Active Directory (AD) group retrieval during authentication, while this error is seen in live logs:
ERROR_TOKEN_GROUPS_INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:
Cisco Identity Services Engine
Microsoft Active Directory
Components Used
This document is not restricted to specific software versions of Identity Services Engine (ISE).
Problem
The problem is that user account used to join ISE to AD does not have correct privileges to get tokenGroups. This would not happen if Domain Admin account was used to join ISE to AD. To fix this issue, you have to add ISE node(s) to the user account and provide those permissions to ISE node(s):
List contents
Read all properties
Read permissions
This issue is seen, even though permissions for user seems to be correct (check against ISE 1.3 AD Authentications Fail with Error: "Insufficient Privilege to Fetch Token Groups"). Those debugs are seen in ad-agent.log:

Solution
To provide required permissions to user account, perform those steps:
1. on AD navigate to Properties for AD user account:
2. Choose Security tab and click Add:
3. Select Object Types:
4. Select Computers and click OK:
5. Insert ISE hostname (VCHRENEK-ISE4 in this example) and click OK:
6. Select ISE node and click Advanced:
7. From Advanced Security Settings select ISE machine account and click Edit:
8. Provide those permissions to ISE machine account and click OK:
After these changes, AD groups should be retrieved without any issues:
This has to be performed for all users and changes should be replicated to all Domain Controllers in the domain.
