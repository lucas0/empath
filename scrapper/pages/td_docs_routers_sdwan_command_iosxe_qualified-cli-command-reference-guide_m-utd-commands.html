Command History
Release Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco SD-WAN Manager CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
File analysis is the process of submitting an unknown file to Cisco Secure Malware Analytics (formerly Threat Grid) cloud for Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v detonation in a sandbox environment. During detonation, the sandbox captures artefacts and observes behaviors of the file, then gives the file an overall score. Based on the observations and score, Threat Grid may change the threat response to Clean or Malicious. Findings from Threat Grid are reported back to the Cisco AMP cloud, so that all Cisco AMP customers are protected against newly discovered malware.
Examples
The following example shows how to configure an AMP file analysis profile with critical alerts, and a profile that analyzes flv and pdf files:
Device(config)# utd engine standard multi-tenancy
Device(config-utd-multi-tenancy)# file-analysis profile file-analysis-profile1
Device(config-utd-mt-file-an-profile)# alert level critical
Device(config-utd-mt-file-an-profile)# file-types
Device(config-utd-mt-file-an-types)# flv
Device(config-utd-mt-file-an-types)# pdf

Release Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco SD-WAN Manager CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
Use the file-inspection profile command to configure an Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (Cisco AMP) file inspection profile.
Under the file inspection profile, a file reputation profile is required, and a file analysis profile is optional. Both must be configured first before assigning them to the file inspection profile.
Examples
The following example shows how to configure a file inspection profile that calls a file analysis and file reputation profiles:
Device(config)# utd engine standard multi-tenancy
Device(config-utd-multi-tenancy)# file-inspection profile file-inspection-profile1
Device(config-utd-mt-file-insp)# analysis profile file-analysis-profile1
Device(config-utd-mt-file-insp)# reputation profile file-reputation-profile1
After you configure the file-inspection profile, you can call it per VRF:
Device(config)# utd engine standard multi-tenancy
Device(config-utd-multi-tenancy)# policy utd-policy-vrf-1
Device(config-utd-mt-policy)# file-inspection profile file-inspection-profile1
Device(config-utd-mt-policy)# vrf 1
