Set Affinity Group by Control Policy
You can configure a control policy to match specific TLOCs or routes and assign them an affinity group value, overriding the affinity group that they inherit from the router.
Route Aggregation on Border Routers and Transport Gateways
With this feature, you can configure route aggregation on border routers and transport gateways in a Multi-Region Fabric network environment. For a border router, you can optionally specify whether the route aggregation operates only for the router’s core region or access region.
Cisco SD-WAN Routing
Support for MSDP to Interconnect Cisco SD-WAN and Non-SD-WAN
This feature enables Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) interoperability between Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices in Cisco SD-WAN and the devices in a non-SD-WAN setup.
Cisco vSmart Controller Route Filtering by TLOC Color
Cisco vSmart controllers can reduce the number of routes that they advertise to routers in the network, to exclude routes that are not relevant to a particular device. The filtering to reduce the number of routes is based on the colors of TLOCs on each device. For example, a route to a public TLOC is not relevant to a router that only has private TLOCs. Advertising fewer routes helps to avoid reaching the send path limit for routers in the network.
