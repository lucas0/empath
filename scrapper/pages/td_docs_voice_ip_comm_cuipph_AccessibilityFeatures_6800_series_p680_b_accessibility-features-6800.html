Accessibility Features for the Cisco IP Phone 6800 Series
The Cisco IP Phone 6800 Series Multiplatform Phones provide accessibility features for the blind, and the visually, hearing, and mobility impaired. Because many of these features are standard, they can be used by users with disabilities without requiring any special configuration.
In this document, the term phone support pages refers to the web pages that users can access to set up certain features.
Cisco is committed to designing and delivering accessible products and technologies to meet the needs of your organization. You can find more information about Cisco and its commitment to accessibility at this URL: http://www.cisco.com/go/accessibility

Third-Party Accessibility Applications
Cisco works closely with partners to provide solutions that complement the accessibility and usability of Cisco products and solutions. There are third-party applications such as real-time captioning on Cisco IP Phones, Text Telephones for the Deaf (TDD/TTY), Real Time Text (RTT), hearing/voice carry over (HCO/VCO), audible caller ID, inline amplifiers for handsets for louder call sound, "busy lights", audio/visual emergency notifications through Cisco IP Phones (supporting users with disabilities), etc.
Here's a link to a presentation about all the accessibility features of Cisco Unified Communications products, and some third party assistive technology which works with it:
