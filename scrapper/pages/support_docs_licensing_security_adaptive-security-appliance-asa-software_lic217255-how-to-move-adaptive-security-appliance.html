In the Traditional Licenses section, click Access LRP.

Note: If you cannot find the source device information on the Devices tab, you need to add the source device to the list by clicking the Add Devices button.
Step 4:
On the Move Licenses Between Devices page, in the Move Licenses from this Source Device section, from the Returning Device drop-down list, select Yes, and then click Look up or request an RMA Number. Click Next.

In the Review the Licenses to be Moved section, verify that the Source and Destination Device as well as Source and Destination License(s) and their Quantity are correct. In the Send Licenses To section, you can edit the End User and Email Addresses, to which you need to send the license information. Click Submit.
Note: If you have more licenses assigned to the product, the system displays a page where you can enter the number of licenses that you need to move to a target device.
Step 7:
In the Next Steps section, the system displays a notification message which confirms that the license files were successfully generated for the destination device. To download the licenses, click the Download Licenses button. You should also receive the license files to your email within an hour from submitting the License Agreement. 
Caution: Since the email with the license files is sent from do-not-reply@cisco.com, ensure that you check your junk email folder.
