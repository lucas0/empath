Support for MSDP to Interconnect Cisco SD-WAN and Non-SD-WAN
This feature enables Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) interoperability between Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices in Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN and the devices in a non-SD-WAN setup.
Cisco vSmart Controller Route Filtering by TLOC Color
Cisco vSmart controllers can reduce the number of routes that they advertise to routers in the network, to exclude routes that are not relevant to a particular device. The filtering to reduce the number of routes is based on the colors of TLOCs on each device. For example, a route to a public TLOC is not relevant to a router that only has private TLOCs. Advertising fewer routes helps to avoid reaching the send path limit for routers in the network.
