Limited Hardware Warranty
Hardware. Cisco Systems, Inc., or the Cisco Systems, Inc. subsidiary selling the Product ("Cisco") warrants that commencing from the date of shipment to Customer (and in case of resale by a Cisco reseller, commencing not more than ninety (90) days after original shipment by Cisco), and continuing for a period of the longer of (a) ninety (90) days or (b) as otherwise set forth at https://www.cisco.com/go/warranty, the Hardware will be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use. The date of shipment of a Product by Cisco is set forth on the packaging material in which the Product is shipped. This limited warranty extends only to the original user of the Product. Customer's sole and exclusive remedy and the entire liability of Cisco and its suppliers under this limited warranty will be, at Cisco's or its service center's option, shipment of a replacement within the warranty period and according to the replacement process described in the warranty card (if any), or if no warranty card, as described on the Cisco Product Warranties web page https://www.cisco.com/go/warranty or a refund of the purchase price if the Hardware is returned to the party supplying it to Customer, freight and insurance prepaid. Cisco replacement parts used in Hardware replacement may be new or equivalent to new. Cisco's obligations hereunder are conditioned upon the return of affected Hardware in accordance with Cisco's or its service center's then-current Return Material Authorization (RMA) procedures.
Restrictions. This limited warranty does not apply if the Hardware (a) has been altered, except by Cisco or its authorized representative, (b) has not been installed, operated, repaired, or maintained in accordance with instructions supplied by Cisco, (c) has been subjected to abnormal physical or electrical stress, abnormal environmental conditions, misuse, negligence, or accident; or (d) is licensed for beta, evaluation, testing or demonstration purposes.
