ICE Implementation on MPP
Implementation of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) on Multiplatform Phones (MPP) provides the most optimized and direct media path for audio and video calls. Before this implementation, the media path traversed through a cloud-hosted media server. With ICE, the resources used by the media relay nodes are reduced by 90%. When you enable ICE, all Webex calls with MPP phones negotiate the most optimized path with this feature.
To configure this feature you modify the database at a tenant or device level. Only Cisco Service Readiness Engineering (SRE) team can modify this feature. MPP supports full ICE mode as per RFC-5245.
To enable ICE on MPP, the variable ICE_STUN_Enable in the device profile is modified with the following syntax.
<STUN_Enable ua="na">Yes</STUN_Enable>
<ICE_STUN_Enable ua="na">Yes</ICE_STUN_Enable> 
<STUN_Server ua="na">10.89.68.76</STUN_Server>
The configuration variable ICE_STUN_Enable is hidden on the phone web interface. The others are shown on the phone web interface.
This feature cannot be configured or modified from the phone web interface. The end user can't modify this feature.
LDAP Cache for SIP User Credentials
The phone now saves the LDAP user credentials in a local cache when the credentials are configured manually on the phone, administration web page, or phone configuration XML file (cfg.xml). In addition to the host user of the phone, the LDAP cache mechanism is also applicable for the users who sign into the phone with the Flexible Seating or Extension Mobility feature.
The cached LDAP user credentials are associated with the SIP user ID. When a user accesses the LDAP directory, the phone checks the LDAP cache to locate the user's credentials. If the credentials are found in the cache, the user can access the LDAP directory without the need to sign in.
The phone can save up to 50 user credentials. The phone removes the least-used credentials when the cache size limit is reached.

LDAP StartTLS Support
The phone now supports Start Transport Layer Security (StartTLS) for the communications between the phone and the LDAP server. StartTLS begins as a plain text connection over the standard LDAP port. It provides the flexibility for encrypted or unencrypted communications according to the actual situation of the LDAP server. If the server supports to upgrade the connection to TLS, then StartTLS encrypts the communications using TLS. Otherwise, the communications are unencrypted, for example, in plaintext.
To enable this feature, use the StartTLS Enable field under the LDAP section in Voice > Phone of the phone administration web page.

Menu Shortcuts on PLK and PSK
In addition to the existing features on the programmable line keys (PLK) and the programmable softkeys (PSK), you can configure PLKs and PSKs with more features including menu shortcuts. You can also add features and menu shortcuts to the line keys of the key expansion module.
You have the following options for PLK and PSK configuration in the phone web interface or in the configuration file:
To enable the user to choose the features or menu shortcuts to add on the line keys, configure the Customizable PLK Options parameter with the extended features and menu shortcuts.
To enable the user to access a feature or a menu with a line key, configure the line key with the feature or the menu shortcut on the Voice > Phone tab.
To enable the user to access a feature or a menu with a softkey, configure a PSK with the feature or the menu shortcut and add it to the desired key list on the Voice > Phone tab.
To enable the user to access features or menus with the line keys on the attached key expansion module, configure the key expansion module keys on Voice > Att Console

Menu Visibility Configuration
You can configure the phone to:
show or hide specific menu items on the phone screen.
enable or disable the personal directory.
enable or disable the ability to search for contacts in all the directories.
By default, all the menu items, the personal directory, and the feature of contact search in all directories are available to users. You can hide particular items with the fields in the Menu Visibility and Directory Services sections on the Voice > Phone tab in the phone web interface.
If you hide a menu item, it doesn't display on the phone screen. If you disable the personal directory, users can't see Personal address book on the phone screen or the Personal Directory tab in the phone web interface. In this case, users can't add contacts from the call history. If you disable the contact search in all directories, users can only search for contacts in a selected directory, instead of all the directories.

Reverse Name Lookup for Inbound Calls using Broadsoft Directories
The reverse name lookup searches the phone's external directories. When a search succeeds, the name is placed in the call session and in the call history. For simultaneous multiple phone calls, reverse name lookup searches for a name to match the first call number. When the second call connects or is placed on hold, reverse name lookup searches for a name to match the second call. The reverse lookup searches the external directories for 8 secs, if in 8secs there is no result found, there will be no display of the name. If a result is found in 8secs, the name is diplayed on the phone. The external directory search priority order is : BroadSoft(XSI) > LDAP > XML.

Reverse Name Lookup for Local Directory
This feature enables to do a reverse name lookup against local contacts for BroadWorks server call logs. If the call number of server call logs matches that in the local directory, the call name of server call logs will be replaced with contact name in the local directory. Also, if the call number does not match any entry in local directory, the call number will do caller id mapping and lookup the local directory again.

Limitations and Restrictions
Phone Behavior During Times of Network Congestion
Anything that degrades network performance can affect phone audio and, in some cases, can cause a call to drop. Sources of network degradation can include, but are not limited to, the following activities:
Administrative tasks, such as an internal port scan or security scan
Attacks that occur on your network, such as a Denial of Service attack
Multicast Paging Scripts Change to Empty after the Upgrade (CSCvu23613)
The default values of multicast paging scripts change from 800 to empty automatically after the upgrade to 11.3.2.
This behaviour typically occurs if the multicast paging scripts were not modified before the upgrade.
This behaviour doesn't occur if you have previously changed the multicast paging scripts to non-default values before the upgrade.
On the phone administration web page, you can check the values of multicast paging scripts from Voice > Phone > Multiple Paging Group Parameters.
After the upgrade, if you want to use the default values in the previous releases, you can configure the parameters on the administration web page.
The following list shows the default values of the multicast paging scripts in the previous releases:
Before 11.3(1) firmware releases, the default values are:
pggrp=224.168.168.168:34560;name=All;num=800;listen=yes;
In 11.3(1) firmware release, the default values are:
pggrp=224.168.168.168:34560;name=Group_1;num=800;listen=yes;pri=1;codec=g722
You can also configure the parameter in the phone configuration file with XML(cfg.xml) by entering a string in this format:
<Group_1_Paging_Script ua="na">pggrp=224.168.168.168:34560;name=All;num=800;listen=yes;</Group_1_Paging_Script>
<Group_1_Paging_Script ua="na">pggrp=224.168.168.168:34560;name=GroupA;num=800;listen=yes;pri=1;codec=g711a;</Group_1_Paging_Script>
