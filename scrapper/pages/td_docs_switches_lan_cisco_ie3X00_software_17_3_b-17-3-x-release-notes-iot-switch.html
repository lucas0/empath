Note
The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.
Smart Licensing Using Policy in Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.2
An enhanced version of Smart Licensing is available, with the overarching objective of providing a licensing solution that does not interrupt the operations of your network, rather, one that enables a compliance relationship to account for the hardware and software licenses you purchase and use.
With this licensing model, you do not have to complete any licensing-specific operations, such as registering or generating keys before you start using the software and the licenses that are tied to it. Only export-controlled and enforced licenses require Cisco authorization before use. License usage is recorded on your device with timestamps, and the required workflows can be completed at a later date.
Multiple options are available for license usage reporting – this depends on the topology you implement. You can use the Cisco Smart Licensing Utility (CSLU) Windows application, or report usage information directly to Cisco Smart Software Manager (CSSM). A provision for offline reporting for air-gapped networks, where you download usage information and upload to CSSM, is also available.
Starting with this release, Smart Licensing Using Policy is automatically enabled on the device. This is also the case when you upgrade to this release.
By default, your Smart Account and Virtual Account in CSSM is enabled for Smart Licensing Using Policy.

Note
Starting with Cisco IOS XE Amsterdam 17.3.2, with the introduction of Smart Licensing Using Policy, even if you configure a hostname for a product instance or device, only the Unique Device Identifier (UDI) is displayed.
This change in the display can be observed in all licensing utilities and user interfaces where the hostname was displayed in earlier releases. It does not affect any licensing functionality. There is no workaround for this limitation.
The licensing utilities and user interfaces that are affected by this limitation include only the following: Cisco Smart Software Manager (CSSM), Cisco Smart License Utility (CSLU), and Smart Software Manager On-Prem (SSM On-Prem).
New Features for Cisco Catalyst IE and ESS Switches in Cisco IOS XE 17.3.1
The following features apply to both the IE3x00 and ESS3300 switches unless specifically mentioned.
Feature Name
License Level
Description, and Documentation Link Information
MRP 500ms Profile Support
Network Essentials
(Must have MRP Ring Manager or Client License)
In today’s Ethernet based Industrial Automation applications, one of the critical features is the availability of the communication network. This availability of the network will influence directly the availability of control system of the manufactory plant. The important characteristic of a plant is how long it can run when the control system in a fault state. This recovery time, namely grace time, has different values depending on the type of application.
Media Redundancy Protocol (MRP) is one of the ring protocols supported by Cisco for such applications. With this release, IE3x00 will now support 200ms and 500ms profiles. With support of 500ms profile, the IE3x00 is now in compliance with IEC62439-2.
Media Redundancy Auto-Manager (MRA)
Network Essentials (Must have MRP Ring Manager License)
An MRP compliant network shall have a ring topology with multiple nodes. The nodes consist of two different types, i.e. Media Redundancy Manager (MRM) and Media Redundancy Clients (MRC). MRM periodically sends frames on one of the ring ports and receives on the other one, in order to monitor the status of the ring topology; MRC reacts on received reconfiguration frames from the MRM.
Certain nodes or all nodes in the ring topology may also start as a Media Redundancy Auto-manager (MRA). MRAs exchange frames to elect one MRM among themselves, and the rest will transition into MRCs. The MRA role is not an operational MRP role like MRM or MRC. It is only an administrative, temporary role at device start-up, and a node must transition to the MRM role or the MRC role after start-up and the MRM is selected through the manager voting process.
QinQ Support
Network Essentials
Traditional 802.1Q tunneling (QinQ) performs all-to-one bundling of C-VLAN IDs to a single S-VLAN ID for the port. The S-VLAN is added to the incoming unmodified C-VLAN. You can configure the UNI as an 802.1Q tunnel port for traditional QinQ, or you can configure selective QinQ on trunk ports for a more flexible implementation. Mapping takes place at ingress and egress of the port. All packets on the port are bundled into the specified S-VLAN.
Selective QinQ maps the specified customer VLANs entering the UNI to the specified S-VLAN ID. The S-VLAN is added to the incoming unmodified C-VLAN. You can also specify that traffic carrying all other customer VLAN IDs is dropped.
For quality of service (QoS), the switch supports flexible mapping between C-CoS or C-DSCP and S-CoS, and maps the inner CoS to the outer CoS for traffic with traditional QinQ or selective QinQ VLAN mapping.
HSR Support
Network Essentials
HSR achieves the same result as PRP but designed to work in a ring topology. Instead of two parallel independent networks of any topology in PRP (LAN-A and LAN-B), HSR defines a ring with traffic in opposite directions. Port-A sends traffic counterclockwise in Ring, and Port-B sends traffic clockwise in Ring. The packet format is different from PRP, instead of RCT, HSR introduces the HSR header with HSR ETHERTYPE after the L2 MACSA address or VLAN tag fields.
Only HSR-SAN mode is supported in 17.3.1 on IE 3400 Advanced ONLY (including ie3400H +). It is not supported on ESS 3300 or ie3200 / 3300.
Source Specific Multicast – IPv4
Network Advantage
Source Specific Multicast (SSM). SSM is an extension of IP multicast where datagram traffic is forwarded to receivers from only those multicast sources that the receivers have explicitly joined. For multicast groups configured for SSM, only source-specific multicast distribution trees (not shared trees) are created.
IPv6 Multicast Routing
Network Advantage
Cisco software supports the following protocols to implement IPv6 multicast routing:
PIM SSM
MLD
PIM SSM functionality is similar to that of IPv4 as mentioned in section 2.10 MLD. It is used by IPv6 devices to discover multicast listeners (nodes that want to receive multicast packets destined for specific multicast addresses) on directly attached links. There are two versions:
MLD version 1 is based on version 2 of the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) for IPv4.
MLD version 2 is based on version 3 of the IGMP for IPv4.
HSRP Aware PIM
Network Advantage
Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) has no inherent redundancy capabilities and its operation is completely independent of Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) group states. As a result, IP multicast traffic is forwarded not necessarily by the same device as is elected by HSRP. HSRP Aware PIM enables multicast traffic to be forwarded through the HSRP active router (AR), allowing PIM to leverage HSRP redundancy, avoid potential duplicate traffic, and enable failover, depending on the HSRP states in the device. The PIM designated router (DR) runs on the same gateway as the HSRP AR and maintains mroute states.
Full POST
Network Essentials
POST feature tests the hardware to verify that all components of the device are present and operational.
Smart Software Manager On-Prem (SSM On-Prem) Support for Smart Licensing Using Policy
Note 
This feature applies to Cisco Catalyst IE3x00 Rugged Series Switches, Cisco IE 3400 Heavy Duty Series Switches, and Cisco Embedded Services 3300 Series Switches in IOS-XE 17.3.3.
—
SSM On-Prem is an asset manager, which works with CSSM. It enables you to administer products and licenses on your premises instead of having to directly connect to CSSM.
Here, a product instance is connected to SSM On-Prem, and SSM On-Prem becomes the single point of interface with CSSM. The product instance can be configured to push the required information to SSM On-Prem. Alternatively, SSM On-Prem can be set-up to pull the required information from a product instance at a configurable frequency. After usage information is available in SSM On-Prem, you must synchronize the same with CSSM, to ensure that the product instance count, license count and license usage information is the same on both, CSSM and SSM On‐Prem. Offline and online options are available for synchronization between CSSM and SSM On‐Prem.
Minimum Required SSM On-Prem Version: Version 8, Release 202102.
Minimum Required Cisco IOS XE Version: Cisco IOS XE 17.3.3.
A license level does not apply.
Important Notes
IE3400: Hardware Changes may Require Action
Some hardware components on the Cisco Catalyst IE3400 Rugged Series and Cisco Catalyst IE3400 Heavy Duty Series switches have changed. The changes, which are automatically handled by the IOS-XE software, do not affect switch functionality or the ordering process.
However, you may need to upgrade the software, depending on which base switch and expansion module you have, as shown in the following table.

Note
For detailed information about affected hardware versions, supported software releases, and instructions for different scenarios, see FN72400 - New Hardware Versions of Cisco Catalyst IE3400 Rugged/IE3400H Heavy Duty Series Will Be Supported with Minimum Software Release - Software Upgrade Recommended on Cisco.com.
If you have...
Then...
Older versions of the base switch and expansion module
No action is required; however, we recommend that you upgrade to IOS-XE 17.31 or later.
Newer versions of the base switch and expansion module
Deploy one of the supported releases of IOS-XE. Otherwise, you see an error message telling you that the release that you are using is not supported.
Newer version of the base switch with an older version of the expansion module
Older version of the base switch with a newer version of the expansion module
Deploy one of the supported releases of IOS-XE. Otherwise, you see an error message telling you that the release that you are using is not supported.
The supported releases are 17.3.6 through 17.3.8.
Do not downgrade to earlier releases.
Use of CTS Before Upgrade
If CTS is used before upgrading to 17.3.3, and the device is booted from sdflash, after upgrading to 17.3.3, use the following command to ensure CTS works after upgrade.
Switch# cts credentials id swith1 password xxxxx
Accessing Hidden Commands
Hidden commands have always been present in Cisco IOS XE, but were not equipped with CLI help. This means that entering enter a question mark (?) at the system prompt did not display the list of available commands. Such hidden commands are only meant to assist Cisco TAC in advanced troubleshooting and are therefore not documented. For more information about CLI help, see the Using the Command-Line Interface → Understanding the Help System chapter of the Command Reference document.
This section provides information about hidden commands in Cisco IOS XE and the security measures in place, when they are accessed. Hidden commands are meant to assist Cisco TAC in advanced troubleshooting and are therefore not documented. For more information about CLI help, see the Using the Command-Line Interface → Understanding the Help System chapter of the Command Reference document.
Hidden commands are available under:
Category 1—Hidden commands in privileged or User EXEC mode. Begin by entering the service internal command to access these commands.
Category 2—Hidden commands in one of the configuration modes (global, interface and so on). These commands do not require the service internal command.
Further, the following applies to hidden commands under Category 1 and 2:
The commands have CLI help. Entering enter a question mark (?) at the system prompt displays the list of available commands.

Note
For Category 1, enter the service internal command before you enter the question mark; you do not have to do this for Category 2.
The system generates a %PARSER-5-HIDDEN syslog message when the command is used. For example:
*Feb 14 10:44:37.917: %PARSER-5-HIDDEN: Warning!!! 'show processes memory old-header ' is a hidden command. 
Use of this command is not recommended/supported and will be removed in future.
Apart from category 1 and 2, there remain internal commands displayed on the CLI, for which the system does NOT generate the %PARSER-5-HIDDEN syslog message.

Important
We recommend that you use any hidden command only under TAC supervision. If you find that you are using a hidden command, open a TAC case for help with finding another way of collecting the same information as the hidden command (for a hidden EXEC mode command), or to configure the same functionality (for a hidden configuration mode command) using non-hidden commands.

Licensing
This section provides information about the licensing packages for features available on Cisco Catalyst IE3x00 Rugged, and ESS3300 Series Switches.
License Levels
The software features available on Cisco Catalyst IE3x00 Rugged and ESS3300 switches fall under these base or add-on license levels.
For a summarized list of features in each license level, see the product datasheets.
Base Licenses
Network Essentials
Network Advantage—Includes features available with the Network Essentials license and more.
Add-On Licenses
Add-On licenses require Network Essentials or Network Advantage as a pre-requisite. The features available with add-on license levels provide Cisco innovations on the switch, as well as on the Cisco Digital Network Architecture Center (Cisco DNA Center).
DNA Essentials
DNA Advantage— Includes features available with the DNA Essentials license and more.
Feature Licenses
Feature licenses are bound to aspecific feature or set of features. Feature licenses can be enabled regardless of Base License (Network Advantage or Network Essential). Feature licenses are smart licenses as well and require a smart account to be activated.
MRP requires a feature license. There are two MRP licenses available for Cisco IE3x00.
LIC-MRP-MGR-XE= MRP Ring Manager license.
LIC-MRP-CLIENT-XE= MRP Ring Client License.
To enable enforced feature licenses, such as MRP:
Obtain the authorization code for feature licensing, using the following command:
license smart authorization request add [mrp_client|mrp_manager] local 
Enable the licensing by using the following command:
platform license feature [mrp-client | mrp-manager] 
License Types
The following license types are available:
Permanent: for a license level, and without an expiration date.
Evaluation: a license that is not registered.

Note
Evaluation licenses are only used in Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.1. Starting with Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.2, Evaluation licenses are no longer used by Smart Licensing.
Term: a time-based license for a three, five, or seven year period.
License Levels - Usage Guidelines
Base licenses (Network Advantage) are ordered and fulfilled only with a permanent license type.
Add-on licenses (DNA Essentials, DNA Advantage) are ordered and fulfilled only with a term license type.
An add-on license level is included when you choose a network license level. If you use DNA features, renew the license before term expiry, to continue using it, or deactivate the add-on license and then reload the switch to continue operating with the base license capabilities.
Evaluation licenses cannot be ordered. They are not tracked via Cisco Smart Software Manager and expire after a 90-day period. Evaluation licenses can be used only once on the switch and cannot be regenerated. Warning system messages about an evaluation license expiry are generated only 275 days after expiration and every week thereafter. An expired evaluation license cannot be reactivated after reload.

Note
Evaluation licenses are only used in Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.1. Starting with Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.2, Evaluation licenses are no longer used by Smart Licensing.
Network Essentials license is the default license. It is permanent. A connection to the Smart Licensing server is not required if the IE switch will be deployed with a Network Essentials license.
Smart Licensing
Cisco Smart Licensing is a unified license management system that manages all the software licenses across Cisco products.
It enables you to purchase, deploy, manage, track, and renew Cisco Software. It provides information about license ownership and consumption through a single user interface.
The solution is composed of Smart Accounts and Cisco Smart Software Manager. The former is an online account of your Cisco software assets and is required to use the latter. Cisco Smart Software Manager is where you can perform all your licensing management-related tasks such as establishing trust, checking license usage, transferring licenses, removing devices, and so forth. Users can be added and given access and permissions to the smart account and specific virtual accounts.

Important
Cisco Smart Licensing is the default and the only available method to manage licenses on IE3x00 products.
Deploying Smart Licensing
The following provides a process overview of a day 0 to day N deployment directly initiated from a device. Links to the configuration guide provide detailed information to help you complete each one of the smaller tasks.
Procedure
Step 1
Begin by establishing a connection from your network to Cisco Smart Software Manager on cisco.com.
Step 2
Create and activate your Smart Account, or login if you already have one.
To create and activate Smart Account, go to Cisco Software Central → Create Smart Accounts. Only authorized users can activate the Smart Account.
Step 3
Complete the Cisco Smart Software Manager set up.
Accept the Smart Software Licensing Agreement.
Set up the required number of Virtual Accounts, users and access rights for the virtual account users.
Virtual accounts help you organize licenses by business unit, product type, IT group, and so on.
With this,
The device is now in an authorized state and ready to use.
The licenses that you have purchased are displayed in your Smart Account.
What to do next
Register and convert traditional licenses to Smart Licenses.
Using Smart Licensing on an Out-of-the-Box Device
If an out-of-the-box device has the software version factory-provisioned, all licenses on such a device remain in evaluation mode until registered in Cisco Smart Software Manager.
How Upgrading or Downgrading Software Affects Smart Licensing
Note how upgrading to a release that supports Smart Licensing or moving to a release that does not support Smart Licensing affects licenses on a device:
When you upgrade from an earlier release to one that supports Smart Licensing—all existing licenses remain in evaluation mode until registered in Cisco Smart Software Manager. After registration, they are made available in your Smart Account.
When you downgrade to a release where Smart Licensing is not supported—all smart licenses on the device are converted to traditional licenses and all smart licensing information on the device is removed.
Known Issues
This section contains information about the known issues in this release.
IGMP Snooping and Unregistered Multicast Packet Forwarding
Symptoms: Although the mrouter port is configured and multicast receivers have sent igmp-joins to listen to registered multicast streams, unknown multicast streams that ingress the switch are forwarded to all the ports. The flooding may lead to reduction in bandwidth for registered multicast traffic.
Conditions: The issue occurs when the switch receives unregistered multicast packets with a pure L2 configuration and an external IGMP snooping querier is configured on the VLAN. There should not be a membership join received on any VLAN ports.
Workaround: To stop flooding on unwanted ports in the VLAN, execute the command switchport block multicast on that interface, as shown in the following example:
Switch#configure terminal
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
Switch(config)#interface gigabitEthernet 1/10
Switch(config-if)#switchport block ?        
  multicast  Block unknown multicast addresses
  unicast    Block unknown unicast addresses
 
Switch(config-if)#switchport block mu
Switch(config-if)#switchport block multicast
