Objective
This article will explain the necessary steps to configure a speed dial on a Programmable Line Key (PLK) of a Cisco IP Phone with Multiplatform Firmware.
Introduction
Cisco Multiplatform Phones (MPP) provide Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) communication using Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). SIP is the most often used signaling protocol that initiates, maintains, and terminates real-time sessions. These sessions may include voice, video, and messaging applications. This eliminates the need for traditional phone lines, making phones more portable within the company. With VoIP, a phone uses an existing network infrastructure and internet connection instead of costly T1 phone lines. This gives the ability to manage more calls with fewer 'lines'. Other beneficial options include placing calls on hold, parking calls, transferring calls, and more. Some models allow video communication in addition to VoIP.
MPP phones are built to look like a regular phone, and are used only for that purpose, but essentially, they are a computer and are part of your network. MPP phones require either service from an Internet Telephony Service Provider (ITSP) or an IP Private Branch Exchange (PBX) call control server. WebEx Calling, Ring Central, and Verizon are examples of an ITSP. Some examples of IP PBX services that work with Cisco MPP phones include, Asterisk, Centile, and Metaswitch platforms.
Speed dial is a feature that automates the dialing process to a telephone number or extension. Once configured, the user can press one button to dial a number. Speed dial is common on many phone systems. It is set up for frequently called numbers.
A Cisco IP phone has PLKs. These are the number of simultaneous calls that the user can utilize. If a phone has four line keys (as shown in the image below), that phone has the ability to have four simultaneous active calls. Some offices may have different departments that have different phone numbers configured on each line. When a call comes in on a certain line, the person receiving the call knows how to answer.
If there are more lines available than needed, speed dial can be set on one or more of these line keys. Setting a speed dial on a line key disables that line and it will no longer receive outside calls. An option for some models is to add more line keys with a Key Expansion Module (KEM).
Note: Some Cisco IP Phones do not have programmable feature buttons as there are no extra lines available.
Many users would like to keep their line keys available for calls or have more speed dials to enter than available line keys. For instructions on this configuration, click here.

Configure Speed Dial on a Programmable Line Key
Step 1. In order to access the Graphical User Interface (GUI), you need to know the IP address of the phone. Cisco IP phones do not come with a default IP address. If you do not know how to find the IP address of your phone, click here for instructions.
Step 2. Access the GUI of the phone. If you would like assistance on this, click here.
Step 3. Choose Admin Login > advanced.
Note: Another option is to enter the IP address of the phone and add /admin/advanced in the web browser.
Step 4. Select Voice > Phone.
Step 5. Find the line key that you chose to assign as speed dial and select Disabled from the Extension drop-down list. In the Extended Function field, enter the appropriate string value. In this example,
fnc=sd;ext=1001@192.168.0.39;nme=John is entered.
Where:
fnc — definition of the extended function
ext — This is the telephone number or extension number to be dialed.
IP address — This is the IP address of the sip proxy. In this example, it is the IP address of the Raspberry Pi that connects to FreePBX.
nme — (Optional) This is the name of the extension to be dialed. If not specified, the speed dial number will be shown.
Step 6. Click Submit All Changes.
Step 7. Once the configuration has been saved, the name will show up on the screen with an image of a handset with horizontal lines. This is the symbol for speed dial.
Step 8. To make a call to that person, you pick up the handset and push the line key on the phone that is directly to the right or left of the contact you want to call.
Note: If you would like to make the call using speaker phone, or with a headset, you simply push the button and the call will be sent.
You have now configured speed dial on a line key for your IP phone.
You can also be kept up to date on the status of that coworker, whether their line is in use or not. If you would also like to configure and monitor via Busy Lamp Field (BLF), click here.
