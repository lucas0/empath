Support for RFC-8760
The Cisco IP Phone now supports RFC-8760. If supported, the phone sends a SIP register request to the server without an authorization header field and the SIP server responses a 401 status with multiple www-authenticate headers. The headers include support for more secure digest algorithms such as SHA256, SHA-512/256 and MD5.

WxC Outbound Proxy Survivability Support
Phone now has the ability to register to the Site Survivability Gateway (SGW) nodes when WxC SSE nodes are unreachable. When the phone connects to SGW nodes, phone supports only limited set of calling features. When this feature is enabled, user can see a service interruption notification on the phone.
To enable this feature from the phone administration web page, use Survivability Proxy, Survivability Proxy Fallback Intvl parameters under the Proxy and Registration section from Voice > Ext(n) and Survivability Test Mode parameter under System Configuration section from Voice > System.
