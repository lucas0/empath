Introduction
The goal of this document is to configure an ISDN Basic Rate Interface (BRI) to dial and carry traffic to a remote site in the event of a logical failure of the Frame Relay circuit.
Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) is not running on the BRIs. Instead, the example in this document uses floating static routes to redirect traffic over the BRI only if normal routes learned through EIGRP over the Frame Relay circuit are lost.
In all routers, ensure that ip classless is enabled.

Remote Site Router
Router C194u is one of the two distribution layer routers. In this example, Router C194u has the BRI to the remote site. The other distribution layer router, C194n, has the companion serial interface to the remote site.

The next router represents the remote site network. Nothing special needs be done here, other than to participate in the IGP dynamic routing protocol, EIGRP, of the access-layer router.

Verify
This section provides information you can use to confirm your configuration is working properly.
Certain show commands are supported by the Output Interpreter Tool (registered customers only) , which allows you to view an analysis of show command output.
With the Frame Relay network down, try a traceroute from the network at the remote site. Based on the network diagram (see figure 1), the target IP address is the loopback interface of the hub site router.
c194ec#trace

  2  *  *  * 
  3  *  *  
    192.168.11.138 24 msec
Notice how it required several packets to get the BRI interface up. Issue the traceroute command again, before the BRI goes inactive and packets are lost:
c194ec#traceroute 192.168.11.141

  2 192.168.11.138 20 msec *  20 msec 
Bring the frame switch up again. With the Frame Relay network now operational, you do not use ISDN:
c194ec#traceroute 192.168.11.141

  3 163.241.222.93 36 msec *  32 msec
The routing tables for the operational Frame Relay network are shown below. Notice how individual routes are learned through EIGRP for networks at the hub site. There is also a default route learned through EIGRP.

The routing tables for when the Frame Relay network is down are shown below. There is still a default route, but some individual routes of networks back at the hub site are lost. But because ip classless is enabled, and you have a default route, you still can get everywhere in the network.
