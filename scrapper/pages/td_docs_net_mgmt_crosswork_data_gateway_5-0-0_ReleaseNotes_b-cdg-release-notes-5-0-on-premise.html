This document provides information about Crosswork Data Gateway 5.0.x for on-premise deployments, including features, compatibility information and updates.
Product Overview
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway is a model-driven scalable data collection platform that enables real-time data collection from multiprotocol capable devices, thereby reducing the need for multiple collection points for multiple applications requiring data from the network.
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway is not a standalone product and is expected to be used with Crosswork deployments. There is no separate software license required for Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway. Use of Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway to forward data to third-party destinations is only supported when using the Crosswork Data Gateway with Crosswork on-premise deployments.
What's New
This section lists the features delivered in Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway 5.0.
Table 1. New Features in Crosswork Data Gateway 5.0
Feature Description
Enhancement to stagger the SNMP and CLI collection jobs
For each collection task, the collectors add an initial skew based on a random 'seed'. This assists the collectors in spacing out the load by distributing poll requests rather than grouping them all on a single clock tick.
Additional language support
Crosswork now lets you change the language of the Crosswork UI to Japanese. The user-specific values such as device names and server names continue to be in English. To change the language, from the Log in screen, select your preferred language.
Enhancement to support the GNMI bundling feature by IOS XR release 7.8.1 and later 1
In IOS XR, gNMI bundling is implemented to stitch together several Update messages that are included in the Notification message of a SubscribeResponse. These messages are sent to the IOS XR device. To bundle the Update messages, you must enable bundling and specify the size of the message in the IOS XR device.
Ability to dynamically enable and disable the collectors1
Crosswork Data Gateway allows the administrator to enable and disable the data collection job on certain containers in the network. With this flexibility, you can regulate the load on the collection to monitor only the needed resources optimally and reduce the resource footprint.
Improvement to the security framework1
When adding a data destination, an additional security authentication layer is added to increase the security. In the Administration > Data Gateway Global Settings > Data Destinations window, you can choose the authentication process type as:
Mutual-Auth: Authenticates external server and the CDG collector after the CA certificate, and Intermediate certificate or Key is uploaded to the Crosswork UI.
Server-Auth: Authenticates external server and the CDG collector after the CA certificate is uploaded to the Crosswork UI.
Ability to configure multiple Syslog servers1
In the Day 0 configuration, you can configure many remote servers to use the same port and protocol. After the Day 1 configuration, you can modify the remote server settings using the interactive menu in the 5.0 release. You can customize the server IP, port, protocol, TLS peer name, and Syslog root certificate with this option.
When one of the servers becomes inaccessible, a standby server takes its place to ensure continuity. The objective of having numerous servers is to achieve high availability.
Support for predefined HA pool types 1
During the Crosswork Data Gateway pool creation, predefined pool types are introduced. The pool types are:
L2 Stretch: The pool in which the network devices connect to Crosswork Data Gateway instances that are part of a HA pool residing on a single IP subnet. The subnet can be intra-DC (Domain Controller) or extended inter-DC.
L3 with Load Balancer: The pool in which the network devices connect to Crosswork Data Gateway instances that reside across multiple different subnets which are part of the same HA pool. This configuration requires an external Network Load Balancer (NLB) to host a VIP towards the network devices while shielding the internal subnet addresses of the Crosswork Data Gateway HA pool.
Note
  The L3 with Load Balancer pool type is supported only when you are creating a pool in the Amazon EC2 environment.
Additional operational alarms1
Additional alarms are introduced to send a notification when an exception occurs during the deployment stage.
Option to modify the interface address1
Crosswork Data Gateway allows you to modify the interfaces that are already associated with a data gateway instance after it has been installed. When Crosswork Data Gateway indicates IP address difficulties such as address conflicts or erroneous addresses, this may be required.
Reconfiguring an interface involves modifying the interface name, assigning it an IP address, and obtaining access to the security group that is linked to it.
Included the auto-configuration functionality to deploy Crosswork Data Gateway2
Auto-configuration feature discovers the missing configuration parameters and automatically introduces the required parameters to install Base VM. The auto-configuration approach defines only the essential parameters with default values in the Day 0 configuration.
The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) framework used to communicate the configuration settings.
gNMI Collector Enhancements
Optimized the gNMI collector performance for increased scale.
Improvement to the way data is sent to gRPC-based destination1
Crosswork Data Gateway send the collected data to gRPC destinations following a data stream.
Improvements in the Data Gateway Management Page in the Cisco Crosswork UI1
Numerous improvements in the Data Gateway Management pages in the Cisco Crosswork UI (Administration > Data Gateway Management) to improve usability.
Ability to deploy multiple system devices packages1
A system device package is supplied through the application-specific manifest file as a simple JSON file whenever an application is installed or updated.
Cisco Element Management Functions (EMF), Crosswork Applications, and other applications can deploy multiple system device packages for each collector.
Protocol data collection1
Added customization options enable the user to choose either gNMI or SNMP protocols to be used for collecting interface state and statistics data.
Crosswork Data Gateway works with devices that support the OpenConfig data models.
Introduced the maintenance mode feature1
The maintenance mode feature allows a Crosswork Data Gateway VM to be taken offline without disrupting the data collection ability. The maintenance mode allows you to force a failover from a VM to a standby VM that resides within the same pool. To optimally use this feature, enter the maintenance mode before you perform maintenance or tuning procedures.
Provision to disable the SNMP trap check1
The Device Management > Network Devices window has a new check box. If you select it, Crosswork disables the SNMPv2 community string validation between the network device and Crosswork Data Gateway.
Deprecation of data collection using the NETCONF collector
Crosswork Data Gateway is announcing the deprecation of the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)-based data collection from network devices from the Cisco Crosswork Network Controller 5.0 release.

Control/Data Traffic
Device Access Traffic
Management traffic: for accessing the Interactive Console and passing the Control/Data information between servers (for example, a Crosswork application to Crosswork Data Gateway).
Control/Data traffic: for data and configuration transfer between Crosswork Data Gateway and Crosswork deployments and other external data destinations.
Device access traffic: for device access and data collection.
Note
  Due to security policies, traffic from subnets of a vNIC received on other vNICs is dropped. For example, in a 3 vNIC model setup, all device traffic (incoming and outgoing) must be routed through vNIC2. Crosswork Data Gateway drops device traffic received over vNIC0 and vNIC1.
IP Addresses
1 or 2 IPv4 or IPv6 addresses based on the number of interfaces you choose to use. Including one additional IP address to be used as the Virtual IP (VIP) address.
Note
  Crosswork does not support dual stack configurations. Therefore, ALL addresses for the environment must be either IPv4 or IPv6.
In a 3-NIC deployment, you will need to provide an IP address for Management interface (vNIC0) and Control/Data interface (vNIC1) only during installation. A virtual IP address for Device Access Traffic (vNIC2) is assigned when you create a Crosswork Data Gateway pool as explained in the Create a Crosswork Data Gateway Pool section in Cisco Crosswork Network Controller 5.0 Administration Guide.
NTP Servers
The IPv4 or IPv6 addresses or host names of the NTP servers you plan to use. If you want to enter multiple NTP servers, separate them with spaces. These should be the same NTP servers you use to synchronize devices, clients, and servers across your network. Verify that the NTP IP address or host name is reachable on the network or installation will fail.
Also, the ESXi hosts that will run the Crosswork application and Crosswork Data Gateway VM must have NTP configured, or the initial handshake may fail with "certificate not valid" errors.
DNS Servers
The IPv4 or IPv6 addresses of the DNS servers you plan to use. These should be the same DNS servers you use to resolve host names across your network. Confirm that the DNS servers are reachable on the network before attempting installation. The installation will fail if the servers cannot be reached.
DNS Search Domain
The search domain you want to use with the DNS servers, for example, cisco.com. You can have only one search domain.
(optional) Proxy Server
URL of an optional management network proxy server if your environment.
If your environment requires an HTTP or HTTPS proxy in order to access URLs on the public Internet, you must configure a proxy server in order for the Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway to successfully connect to Cisco Crosswork
(optional) Syslog Sever
The hostname or IPv4 or IPv6 address of an external syslog server.
(optional) Auditd Server
The hostname or IPv4 or IPv6 address of an external auditd server.
