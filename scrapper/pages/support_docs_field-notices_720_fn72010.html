Defect Information

Defect ID Headline
CSCvw70354 GS7000 power module overheating

Problem Description

A limited number of power supplies (GS7K-PS-1.2G), with specific serial numbers, in GS7000 nodes might overheat when connected to a power source. The potentially affected units were produced on 2020-05-27 through 2020-05-29. This field notice provides instructions on how to identify affected power supplies and order replacements.

Background

The root cause of an affected power supply potentially overheating is a manufacturing process error for a specific serial number range produced on 2020-05-27 through 2020-05-29.
There was a single event in a customer environment that prompted detailed investigation into the manufacturing assembly process. The root cause of an affected power supply potentially overheating has been remediated. Improvements in the standard operating procedure and quality inspection processes have been implemented.
As a reminder, Cisco encourages customers to follow all safety guidelines and instructions in the Cisco 1.2 GHz GS7000 Node Installation and Operation Guide.
As a precautionary measure, Cisco promptly implemented a proactive replacement program for the limited number of units that are potentially affected. This program applies to the affected power supplies that are used in these Product IDs (PIDs):
G7A2AA102B6XXXXAXX
GS7KH811L13XXXXXXX
GS7KR811X11XXXXXXX
GS7KR411X43XXXXXXX
GS7KS411S11XXXXXXX
GS7KS411S43XXXXXXX
GS7KS811S11XXXXXXX
GS7KS811S13XXXXXXX
G7A2AA202B6XXXXAXX
GS7KS411S13XXXXXXX

Problem Symptom

Affected units might overheat and experience a thermal event.

Workaround/Solution

Cisco requires replacement of the power supply as soon as possible.
Check the serial number to determine if the unit is affected. Impacted units can be identified by either the GS7000 node serial number or its power supply serial number. Refer to the How to Identify Affected Products section for the location of the serial number.
See the Power Supply Replacement Procedure for information on how to replace the power supply while power is maintained to the GS7000 node.
Do not follow the Return Material Authorization (RMA) process for this upgrade. If the unit is affected, refer to the Upgrade Program Information section for instructions on how to submit a replacement request.
Note: Service level agreements do not apply. All affected units will be replaced regardless of contract status.
