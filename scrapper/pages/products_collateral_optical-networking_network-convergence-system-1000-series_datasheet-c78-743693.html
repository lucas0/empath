Document history
    Video traffic continues to grow rapidly. It would take more than 5 million years to watch the amount of video that will cross global IP networks each month in 2021. Every second, a million minutes of video content will cross the network. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) will carry 71 percent of Internet traffic by 2021. Content providers will need to scale their networks at speed to keep up with the demand for more video. Networks need to be designed with “webscale” in mind. A web-scale network needs to scale at deployment speed while being operationally simple. Cisco® Network Convergence System 1004 OTN-XPonder provides the largest flexibility to transport any kind of different services along with complete automation and real-time visibility to deliver a multipurpose/multifunctional card for a variety of different applications.
Product overview
The Cisco NCS 1004 OTN-XPonder (Figure 1) is a single-slot line card capable of supporting multiple functionalities thanks to the all-pluggable interface architecture.
Each NCS 1004 chassis provide four line card slots, and Cisco NCS 1004 OTN-XPonder can be placed in any of them to fill maximum capacity of the shelf (4x).
Figure 1.       
NCS 1004 OTN Xponder Line Card
The Cisco NCS 1004 OTN-XPonder Line Card embeds a flexible core FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array), which allows for support of multiple applications like Muxponder, Transponder, and OTN-Switch, pending future roadmap releases.
The line card features a large variety of different pluggable interfaces:
●      4x DD-QSFP56/QSFP28/QSFP+ ports (two of which can be used as a QSFP-DD trunk as an alternative to CFP2 DCO WDM) for 400GE, 100GE/OTU4, 32G/16G FC, or 10GE/OTU2/OTU2e clients
●      8x QSFP-28/QSFP+ ports for 100G, 32G/16G FC, or 10GE/OTU2/OTU2e clients
●      2x CFP2 DCO WDM for high-performance (with optional encryption) trunks (to be used instead of the DD-QSFP trunk)
Different FPGA images will support different card configuration, pending SW roadmap availability.
Because of this, the line card is ready to support the following configuration:
“Grey Muxponder,” available in Cisco IOS®XR Release 7.2.1 and later.
10x10G signals multiplexed onto an OTU4 Grey QSFP28. Up to two slices of the 10x10G Muxponder can be configured on the OTN Xponder line card.
Two major use cases are addressed by such an application:
●      Provide 10G fan out option to 1.2T Muxponder line card. In one NCS1004 chassis can be placed a 1x1.2T Muxponder configured (for example) with a 600G trunk multiplexing a 6xOTU4 coming from a 3xOTN-Xponder line card supporting 20x10G each. This configuration is providing 60x10G over a single 600G lambda in 2RU.
●      Provide 10G to OTU4 demarcation for a customer who requires an OTN “grey” signal hands off to a third-party network. Up to a 4xOTN-Xponder can be placed in a single NCS 1004 chassis to support 80x10G over 8xOTU4 hands off.
In Cisco IOS®XR Release 7.3.1 OTN-XP will be able to support 400G wavelengths with new CFP2 DCO at 400G on the following configurations:
●      2x400GE TXPs over 2x400G 16-QAM WDM lambdas. Supported 400G client type will be 400GE.
●      2x4x100G MXPs over 2x400G 16-QAM WDM lambdas. Supported 100G client types will be 100GE and OTU4.
●      1x400G TXPs + 1x4x100GE/OTU4 MXP over 2x400G WDM lambdas.
In future roadmap releases, OTN-XP will be able to support wavelengths at 200G or 300G as well as additional client rates:
●      40x10G over 1x400G WDM lambda. Supported 10G client type will be 10GE, OTU2 and OTU2e
●      2x2x100G MXPs over 2x 200G QPSK WDM lambdas. Supported 100G client type will be 100GE and OTU4
●      2x3x100GE/OTU4 over 2x1x 300G 8-QAM WDM lambdas
●      Hybrid configuration with 10x10GE/OTU2/OTU2e + 3x100GE/OTU4 over a single 400G 16-QAM WDM lambda
●      Inverse Multiplexing of 400GE over 2x200G QPSK lambdas
Management
The Cisco NCS 1004 provides comprehensive management capabilities to support Operations, Administration, Maintenance, and Provisioning (OAM&P) capabilities through IOS-XR CLI, SNMP, syslog, and XML. In addition, iPXE for automated software download and Zero-Touch Provisioning (ZTP) for automated configuration download are available for simplified installation. For machine-to-machine configuration and management of NCS 1004, NETCONF, RESTCONF, and gRPC transport protocols with JSON, XML, and GPB encoding are provided. OpenConfig protocols for management GNMI and operations GNOI are also supported. The NCS 1004 provides a set of native YANG models as well as the ability to map into any industry standard or customer-defined YANG data models. For monitoring, NCS 1004 provides a streaming telemetry feature that relies on a push mechanism to disseminate user-selected PM and status information at user-specified frequencies at granular 10-second intervals. This improves monitoring speed and scale compared to traditional pull-based mechanisms such as SNMP. The telemetry infrastructure also allows for events such as alarms and port-state changes to be notified.
The NCS 1004 OTN-Xponder can be managed completely using CLI or XML.
OpenConfig is supported for 10x10G Grey Muxponder configuration. The reference model names “openconfig-terminal-device.yang.
The line card supports General Communication Channel (GCC) for remote management and, in future, IKEv2:
●      The line card supports up to 46 GCCs.
●      GCC0 is supported for both client and trunk.
Performance Monitoring
The Cisco NCS 1004 supports performance monitoring of optical parameters on the client and DWDM line interface, including laser bias current, transmit, and receive optical power. Ethernet RMON statistics for the client ports and OTN error counters for the trunk are also available. Calculation and accumulation of the performance-monitoring data are supported in 15-minute and 24-hour intervals as per G.7710.
Key elevator pitch
The Cisco NCS 1004 OTN-XPonder is dramatically improving efficiency, performance, and flexibility for customer networks.

Licensing
NCS 1004 OTN-Xponder is offered with an unlicensed approach as well a PAYG model base on Smart and Non-Smart Licensing.
The unlicensed PID (NCS1K4-OTN-XP=) is offering all the features (including the roadmap one) without the need for any additional licenses, with the exception of the future Encryption License that will be associated with the Trunk WDM DCO Pluggable.
The base license HW NCS1K4-OTN-XPL= PID arrives with zero BW. So, for any 100G increment, the 1x100G license shall be added. Please make use of S-NCS1K4-100G-CL= (or E-NCS1K4-100G-CL= in case of an honor base where the customer doesn’t want to use the Smart Account).
For a typical IOSXR release 7.2.1 application with the “Grey Muxponder,” the 100G BW License is covering up to 10x 10G clients. The OTU4 uplink is already included for this application.
