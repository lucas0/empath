Open Defects in Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Release 2.0.1
Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Streamer
CSCuq56961—EVS: Files disappear when Eng app is placed in background/foreground
Symptom In EVS, files are deleted or disappear when the app is sent to the background and then brought to the front. This causes the app to download the files again when the app is placed in the background, but when the app is brought to the front, the files are deleted or disappear.
Workaround There is no workaround.
CSCuq45818—Delay in Received Multicast File Callbacks
Symptom There is a delay on the Nexus7 associated to Cisco StadiumVision Mobile data serviced by the Streamer. After selecting the file channel DemoStreamFD, the Nexus7 experiences a delay of 5-6 minutes until all of the callbacks are received.
Workaround There is no workaround.
Open Defects in Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Release 2.0.0
This section lists the open defects for the Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Release 2.0.0.
Cisco StadiumVision Mobile SDK
CSCuo50202—Scalable File Distribution: If there is insufficient storage space on the mobile device, the SDK should send a notification to app
Symptom When using Scalable File Distribution, there is insufficient storage space on the mobile device.
Conditions When using the Scalable File Distribution feature, if there is insufficient storage space on the mobile device, the SDK should send an out of space notification to the application.
Currently the SDK does not send a out of space notification.
Workaround There is no workaround.
CSCuo50204—Scalable File Distribution: If file too big it's not transferred and SDK doesn't notify app.
Symptom When using Scalable File Distribution, the Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Streamer will not transfer files in the txfiles directory that are larger than 4MB.
Conditions The SDK does not send a notification to an app developed by a third party.
Workaround There is no workaround.
CSCuo68896—Android Engineering and Sample apps sometimes Audio is distorted in Audio Only Channel feature.
Symptom A selected audio channel plays well initially but it gradually gets distorted. User can navigate to other apps and can hear the audio and return to the Cisco StadiumVision Mobile app. Once the audio channel is distorted it behaves unpredictably.
Workaround If audio distortion occurs stop and start the app again.
CSCuo74426—Unexpected SDK channel pruning
Symptom At times the SDK will decide to prune channels, even though channel announcements have been received within the last 30 seconds.
Conditions The problem was recreated with a Nexus 7, first generation tablet running the 1.3-b2809 eng app. The app was left on the channel list page for several hours, and during that time all channels would repeatedly disappear from the channel list page without apparent reason.
Workaround Restart the application.
CSCuo81745—Audio glitches (buffering stalls) are not reported by SVM SDK
Symptom Audio glitches are not reported by the Cisco StadiumVision Mobile SDK because the third-party library is not reporting audio buffering stalls which should show up as a positive integer in the mongo data in the column SVM.channels.0.decoder.num_audio_buffering_stalls file.
Conditions Start event. Play audio on a Cisco StadiumVision Mobile client such that audio glitches are heard (move to edge of WiFi network reception). Download mongo raw data report from System State report. Check for positive integers in column SVM.channels.0.decoder.num_audio_buffering_stalls.
Expected result is that positive integers exist. The actual result is that the data is all zeros.
Workaround There is no workaround.
CSCup03524—Audio stats are being sent out to Reporter when it shouldn't.
Symptom The Cisco StadiumVision Mobile SDK is sending out stats for the audio only channel if it is not first stopped before a video channel is started. It should stop the audio when video is started and close the audio session and not send out audio stats while video is playing.
Currently Reporter is getting both audio and video stats at the same time on different channels if video is started before audio is stopped.
Workaround Stop the audio channel before starting the video channel.
CSCup03560—After WiFi network change (SSID change) audio can still be heard in the background
Symptom While listening to an audio channel in the background with the Android customer application, another network is picked up, you still hear the old audio channel.
Conditions Bring up the app. Listen to an audio channel in background. Walk away from the current network that is associated with the channel.
Workaround Disconnect/Reconnect from the desired network.
CSCup03578—App crashed when a sequence of audio/video/audio steps are followed
Symptom The Cisco StadiumVision Mobile app crashes.
Conditions
1. Bring up the App.
2. In the Audio tab, select an audio channel and listen for a few seconds.
3. In the Video tab, select a video channel and listen for a few seconds.
4. In the Audio tab, toggle the channel.
Workaround There is no workaround.
CSCup03595—Under rare circumstances fatal exception encountered in Android app
Symptom A fatal exception occurs in the Android app.
Conditions Tab to one of the audio only channels in application and encountered fatal exception.
Workaround There is no workaround.
CSCuw03647—User interface (UI) changes time as per the client time zone
Symptom The UI changes the time of an event based on the client time zone and is displayed in the "Upload Event Schedule" page.
Steps
1. Set up the Reporter server locally in the local time zone.
2. Upload an event schedule from a different time zone.
3. Go to the “Upload Event Schedule” page and check the event time on the already uploaded event schedule.
The Reporter UI should not change the time of the event schedule as per the client time zone, however the Reporter UI changes the time of the event schedule as per the client time zone.
Workaround There is no workaround.
CSCuo50199—When playing a video and home button is pressed sometimes video will stop playing
Symptom Video stops playing.
Conditions Bring up the Cisco StadiumVision Mobile application. Play a video. While it is playing the video, press the home button. Quickly return to the app. It stays on a blank page and the video does not start. The app is active and you can go back to the channel list. This is observed on:
HTC One 5.5 running Android 4.4.2, Google Nexus, Samsung Galaxy S3
Workaround Go back to the channel list and select the video channel again.
CSCuo50209—Upgrading the Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Streamer sometimes causes existing configuration to be lost
Symptom The Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Streamer configuration is lost after performing an upgrade.
Conditions The “streamer.cfg” file no longer contains any configurations.
Workaround To safeguard against this issue it is strongly recommended to backup the existing “streamer.cfg” file before upgrading. If this issue occurs restore the “streamer.cfg” file with the backup copy.
CSCum10962—Mongo DB encounters issues restarting after a power loss or unclean shutdown
Symptom No data will show up to export in the event scorecard because the Raw Data database failed to start even though the rest of the Cisco StadiumVision Mobile services are up and running. The screen remains completely black after selecting the event and the ‘data export’.
When going in marketing mode, then one can see the historical data from today’s session.
Workaround Confirm that the raw database is running by using the TUI: Services Control > Raw Data > Show Status. If the database is not running, attempt to start it.
If that does not work, then repair it in the TUI under: Server Administration > Repair databases > Raw database.
Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Reporter
CSCus49637—AP Perf.CSV includes stats for APs which are removed from AP_names file
Symptom AP Performance CSV includes stats for APs which are removed from the uploaded “AP Names” file. If an AP name is uploaded and then does not exist in a subsequent upload, the Reporter will continue to know about it until the Reporter is restarted.
Steps
1. Upload an event schedule on the reporter and run the event.
2. Upload the “AP Names” file to the reporter with a list of AP Mac addresses and names.
3. Run the event and generate the “AP Performance” report.
4. Remove one AP from the “AP Names” file and upload it again.
5. Run the event and generate the “AP performance” report.
6. Check the report to see if the removed AP is listed as “Unknown” in the report.
Workaround Restart SVM services on the reporter.
CSCus41155—Reporter-Area Performance CSV should include stats for ‘unknown’ AP
Symptom Reporter-Area Performance CSV should include stats for ‘unknown’ AP. In case client devices connect to an unknown access point which is not listed in the uploaded AP Names file on the Reporter, the stats are not captured in the Area Performance CSV file, thus not being included in the data calculations.
Steps
1. Uploaded event schedule on the reporter and run the events.
2. Downloaded the AP Performance which had one client session with “Unknown” AP Name.
3. Checked the AP Area CSV to see if this session time is recorded in this report.
Workaround The AP Area report should include the client stats for “Unknown AP” because clients are connected to the AP and had a valid session. Please check the AP Performance report to see the “Unknown” AP stats.
CSCuq57181—SVM Reporter must redirect to correct URL if http and port 8080 are used
Symptom The Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Reporter login page is accessible using http and port 8080 (http://ip:8080/reporter/index.jsp). This is a problem because subsequent navigation to other applications (such as the Software Manager) may fail.
Workaround Do not use port 8080 and delete all 1.3 bookmarks because are likely to have 8080 embedded in the URL. The correct URL format is http://ip/reporter/dashbaord.svm or https://ip/reporter/dashboard.svm.
CSCus30786—Reporter CSV files do not open correctly in Excel for an Apple MAC
Symptom When opening Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Reporter CSV files on a Mac, they are not recognized.
Conditions This is a consistent issue.
Workaround Open the CSV file in TextEdit, click Save without making any changes. Next, open the saved file in Excel.
CSCuq60093—SVM Reporter is not accessible after upgrade for path 1.2 > 1.3 > 2.0.0
Symptom Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Reporter is not accessible after following the upgrade path 1.2 > 1.3 > 2.0.0 due to missing ssl related packages (imod_ssl-2.2.3-63.el5.x86_64.rpm and distcache-1.4.5-14.1.x86_64.rpm).
Workaround Do not upgrade such a system to 2.0, a fresh installation must be performed. A 1.3 backup cannot be restored onto a 2.0 system. If the 1.3 data needs to be retained, then perform the following procedure to reinstall:
1. Backup Reporter 1.3 to an off-box location.
2. Reinstall Reporter 1.3 from the full 1.3 iso.
3. Restore the backup onto Reporter.
4. Upgrade the new Reporter 1.3 to 2.0.
CSCuq56165—Reporter 1.3 > 2.0 upgrade doesn't upgrade the svm-reporter-cgi package
Symptom The “Export Raw Data” option under System State Report is missing after upgrading from 1.3 > 2.0.
Workaround If retaining 1.3 data is not important, it is recommended to perform a fresh 2.0 install.
If 1.3 data must be preserved, proceed with the 2.0 upgrade and open a TAC case to have the svm-reporter-cgi-2.0.0-365.x86_64.rpm package manually applied.
CSCuq16565—Reporter should reject duplicate event names in all cases
Symptom Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Reporter does not reject or provide an error message for an event schedule that uses the same event name from past event schedules.
Workaround Event names should be unique, both within an event schedule and between event schedules. Once an event name is used for an event, the same event name should not be used for any future events.
