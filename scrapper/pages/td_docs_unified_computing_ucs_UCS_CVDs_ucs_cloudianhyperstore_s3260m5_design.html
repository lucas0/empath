Executive Summary
Cisco Validated Designs consist of systems and solutions that are designed, tested, and documented to facilitate and improve customer deployments. These designs incorporate a wide range of technologies and products into a portfolio of solutions that have been developed to address the business needs of our customers.
The purpose of this document is to describe the design of Cloudian HyperStore on Red Hat Enterprise Linux on the latest generation of Cisco UCS S3260 M5 Servers. This validated design provides the framework of designing and deploying Cloudian SDS software on Cisco UCS S3260 storage servers. The Cisco Unified Computing System provides the compute, network, and storage access components for the Cloudian HyperStore, deployed as a single cohesive system.
This design guide describes how the Cisco Unified Computing System (Cisco UCS) can be used in conjunction with Cloudian 7.1.2. With the continuous evolution of data, there has been lack of enterprise manageability for large capacity storage servers, Cisco UCS with Cloudian provide the solution to solve the challenges, as it increased demand to have Cloudian HyperStore validated on Cisco UCS servers. The Cisco UCS S3260 Storage Server, originally designed for the data center, together with Cloudian HyperStore is optimized for object storage solutions, making it an excellent fit for unstructured data workloads such as backup, archive, file celebration, storage as a service, IOT, video surveillance and cloud storage. The S3260 delivers a complete infrastructure with exceptional scalability for computing and storage resources together with 40 Gigabit Ethernet networking.
Cisco and Cloudian are collaborating to offer customers a scalable object storage solution for unstructured data that integrates UCS with Cloudian HyperStore. With the power of the Cisco UCS management framework, the solution is cost effective to deploy and manage and will enable the next-generation cloud deployments that drive business agility, lower operational costs and avoid vendor lock-in.
Solution Overview
Introduction
Object storage is a highly scalable system for organizing and storing data objects. Object storage does not use a file system structure, instead it ingests data as objects with unique keys into a flat directory structure and the metadata is stored with the objects instead of hierarchical journal or tree. Search and retrieval is performed using RESTful API’s, which uses HTTP verbs such as GETs and PUTs. Most of the newly generated data, about 60 to 80 percent, is unstructured today and new approaches using x86 servers are proving to be more cost effective, providing storage that can be expanded as easily as your data grows. Scale-out Object storage is the newest cost effective approach for handling large amounts of data in the Petabyte and Exabyte range.
The Cloudian HyperStore is a Software-Defined Storage software that is designed to create unbounded scale-out storage systems that accommodates Petabyte scale data from multiple applications and use-cases, including both object and file based applications
Together with Cisco UCS, Cloudian Hyperstore can deliver a fully enterprise-ready solution that can manage different workloads and still remain flexible. The Cisco UCS S3260 Storage Server is an excellent platform to use with the main types of Object and File workloads, such as capacity-optimized and performance-optimized workloads. It is best suited for sequential access, as opposed to random access to unstructured data, and to whatever data size. It is essentially designed for Applications, not direct end-users.
  This document describes the architecture and design procedures of Cloudian Hyperstore software on Cisco UCS S3260 M5 servers along with Cisco UCS C220 M5 Rack-Mount servers for load balancing.

Technology Overview
 Cisco Unified Computing System
Cisco Unified Computing System is a state-of-the-art data center platform that unites computing, network, storage access, and virtualization into a single cohesive system.
The main components of Cisco Unified Computing System are:
·         Computing - The system is based on an entirely new class of computing system that incorporates rack-mount and blade servers based on Intel Xeon Processor scalable family. The Cisco UCS servers offer the patented Cisco Extended Memory Technology to support applications with large datasets and allow more virtual machines per server.
·         Network - The system is integrated onto a low-latency, lossless, 40-Gbps unified network fabric.  This network foundation consolidates LANs, SANs, and high-performance computing networks which are separate networks today. The unified fabric lowers costs by reducing the number of network adapters, switches, and cables, and by decreasing the power and cooling requirements.
·         Virtualization - The system unleashes the full potential of virtualization by enhancing the scalability, performance, and operational control of virtual environments. Cisco security, policy enforcement, and diagnostic features are now extended into virtualized environments to better support changing business and IT requirements.
·         Storage access - The system provides consolidated access to both SAN storage and Network Attached Storage (NAS) over the unified fabric. By unifying the storage access, Cisco Unified Computing System can access storage over Ethernet (NFS or iSCSI), Fibre Channel, and Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE). This provides customers with choice for storage access and investment protection. In addition, the server administrators can pre-assign storage-access policies for system connectivity to storage resources, simplifying storage connectivity, and management for increased productivity.
Cisco Unified Computing System is designed to deliver:
·         A reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and increased business agility.
·         Increased IT staff productivity through just-in-time provisioning and mobility support.
·         A cohesive, integrated system, which unifies the technology in the data center.
·         Industry standards supported by a partner ecosystem of industry leaders.
Cisco UCS Manager
Cisco UCS Manager (UCSM) provides a unified, embedded management of all software and hardware components of the Cisco Unified Computing System across multiple chassis, rack servers, and thousands of virtual machines. It supports all Cisco UCS product models, including Cisco UCS B-Series Blade Servers, Cisco UCS C-Series Rack-Mount Servers, and Cisco UCS Mini, as well as the associated storage resources and networks. Cisco UCS Manager is embedded on a pair of Cisco UCS 6300 or 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects using a clustered, active-standby configuration for high availability. The manager participates in server provisioning, device discovery, inventory, configuration, diagnostics, monitoring, fault detection, auditing, and statistics collection.
Figure 1  Cisco UCS Manager
An instance of Cisco UCS Manager with all Cisco UCS components managed by it forms a Cisco UCS domain, which can include up to 160 servers. In addition to provisioning Cisco UCS resources, this infrastructure management software provides a model-based foundation for streamlining the day-to-day processes of updating, monitoring, and managing computing resources, local storage, storage connections, and network connections. By enabling better automation of processes, Cisco UCS Manager allows IT organizations to achieve greater agility and scale in their infrastructure operations while reducing complexity and risk. The manager provides flexible role and policy-based management using service profiles and templates.
Cisco UCS Manager manages Cisco UCS systems through an intuitive HTML 5 or Java user interface and a CLI. It can register with Cisco UCS Central Software in a multi-domain Cisco UCS environment, enabling centralized management of distributed systems scaling to thousands of servers. Cisco UCS Manager can be integrated with Cisco UCS Director to facilitate orchestration and to provide support for converged infrastructure and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
The Cisco UCS XML API provides comprehensive access to all Cisco UCS Manager functions. The API provides Cisco UCS system visibility to higher-level systems management tools from independent software vendors (ISVs) such as VMware, Microsoft, and Splunk as well as tools from BMC, CA, HP, IBM, and others. ISVs and in-house developers can use the XML API to enhance the value of the Cisco UCS platform according to their unique requirements. Cisco UCS PowerTool for Cisco UCS Manager and the Python Software Development Kit (SDK) help automate and manage configurations within Cisco UCS Manager.
Cisco UCS 6300 Fabric Interconnects
The Cisco UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects are a core part of Cisco UCS, providing both network connectivity and management capabilities for the system. The Cisco UCS 6300 Series offers line-rate, low-latency, lossless 10 and 40 Gigabit Ethernet, Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE), and Fibre Channel functions.
Figure 2  Cisco UCS 6300 Fabric Interconnect
The Cisco UCS 6300 Series provides the management and communication backbone for the Cisco UCS B-Series Blade Servers, 5100 Series Blade Server Chassis, and C-Series Rack Servers managed by Cisco UCS. All servers attached to the fabric interconnects become part of a single, highly available management domain. In addition, by supporting unified fabric, the Cisco UCS 6300 Series provides both LAN and SAN connectivity for all servers within its domain.
From a networking perspective, the Cisco UCS 6300 Series uses a cut-through architecture, supporting deterministic, low-latency, line-rate 10 and 40 Gigabit Ethernet ports, switching capacity of 2.56 terabits per second (Tbps), and 320 Gbps of bandwidth per chassis, independent of packet size and enabled services. The product family supports Cisco® low-latency, lossless 10 and 40 Gigabit Ethernet unified network fabric capabilities, which increase the reliability, efficiency, and scalability of Ethernet networks. The fabric interconnect supports multiple traffic classes over a lossless Ethernet fabric from the server through the fabric interconnect. Significant TCO savings can be achieved with an FCoE optimized server design in which network interface cards (NICs), host bus adapters (HBAs), cables, and switches can be consolidated.
The Cisco UCS 6332 32-Port Fabric Interconnect is a 1-rack-unit (1RU) Gigabit Ethernet, and FCoE switch offering up to 2.56 Tbps throughput and up to 32 ports. The switch has 32 fixed 40-Gbps Ethernet and FCoE ports.
Both the Cisco UCS 6332UP 32-Port Fabric Interconnect and the Cisco UCS 6332 16-UP 40-Port Fabric Interconnect have ports that can be configured for the breakout feature that supports connectivity between 40 Gigabit Ethernet ports and 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports. This feature provides backward compatibility to existing hardware that supports 10 Gigabit Ethernet. A 40 Gigabit Ethernet port can be used as four 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports. Using a 40 Gigabit Ethernet SFP, these ports on a Cisco UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnect can connect to another fabric interconnect that has four 10 Gigabit Ethernet SFPs. The breakout feature can be configured on ports 1 to 12 and ports 15 to 26 on the Cisco UCS 6332UP fabric interconnect. Ports 17 to 34 on the Cisco UCS 6332 16-UP fabric interconnect support the breakout feature.

Cloudian HyperStore Design
Cloudian HyperStore is an Amazon S3-compliant multi-tenant object storage system. The system utilizes a “non-SQL” (NoSQL) storage layer for maximum flexibility and scalability. The Cloudian HyperStore system enables any service provider or enterprise to deploy an S3-compliant multi-tenant storage cloud.
The Cloudian HyperStore system is designed specifically to meet the demands of high volume, multi-tenant data storage:
·         Amazon S3 API compliance. The Cloudian HyperStore system 100% compatible with Amazon S3’s HTTP REST API. Customer’s existing HTTP S3 applications will work with the Cloudian HyperStore service, and existing S3 development tools and libraries can be used for building Cloudian HyperStore client applications.
·         Secure multi-tenancy. The Cloudian HyperStore system provides the capability to have multiple users securely reside on a single, shared infrastructure. Data for each user is logically separated from other users’ data and cannot be accessed by any other user unless access permission is explicitly granted.
·         Group support. An enterprise or work group can share a single Cloudian HyperStore account. Each group member can have dedicated storage space, and the group can be managed by a designated group administrator.
·         Quality of Service (QoS) controls. Cloudian HyperStore system administrators can set storage quotas and usage rate limits on a per-group and per-user basis. Group administrators can set quotas and rate controls for individual members of the group.
·         Access control rights. Read and write access controls are supported at per-bucket and per-object granularity. Objects can also be exposed via public URLs for regular web access, subject to configurable expiration periods.
·         Reporting and billing. The Cloudian HyperStore system supports usage reporting on a system-wide, group-wide, or individual user basis. Billing of groups or users can be based on storage quotas and usage rates (such as bytes in and bytes out).
·         Horizontal scalability. Running on standard off-the-shelf hardware, a Cloudian HyperStore system can scale up to thousands of nodes across multiple datacenters, supporting millions of users and hundreds of petabytes of data. New nodes can be added without service interruption.
·         High availability. The Cloudian HyperStore system has a fully distributed, peer-to-peer architecture, with no single point of failure. The system is resilient to network and node failures with no data loss due to the automatic replication and recovery processes inherent to the architecture. A Cloudian HyperStore geocluster can be deployed across multiple datacenters to provide redundancy and resilience in the event of a data center scale disaster.
Cloudian HyperStore Architecture
The Cloudian HyperStore is a fully distributed architecture that provides no single point of failure, data protection options (replication or erasure coding), data recovery upon a node failure, dynamic re-balancing on node addition, multi-data center and multi-region support.

With Amazon setting the cloud storage standard making it the largest object storage environment, and Amazon S3 API becoming the de facto standard for developers writing storage applications for cloud, it is imperative every Cloud, hybrid storage solution is S3 compliant.  Cloudian HyperStore, in addition to being S3 compliant, also offers the flexibility to be on-premises object storage as well as hybrid tier to Amazon and Google clouds.
  Integrated Billing, Management, and Monitoring
The HyperStore system maintains comprehensive service usage data for each group and each user in the system. This usage data, which is protected by replication, serves as the foundation for HyperStore service billing functionality. The system allows the creation of rating plans that categorize the types of service usage for single users or groups for a selected service period. The CMC has a function to display a single user’s bill report in a browser; HyperStore Admin API can be used to generate user or group billing data that can be ingested a third-party billing application. Cloudian HyperStore also allows for the special treatment of designated source IP addresses, so that the billing mechanism does not apply any data transfer charges for data coming from or going to these “whitelisted” domains.

Cisco and Cloudian
Cisco and Cloudian developed a solution that meets the challenges of scale-out storage. This solution uses Cloudian HyperStore Object Storage software with Cisco UCS S-Series Storage Servers powered by Intel Xeon processors. The Cisco UCS S3260 hardware platform and Cloudian’s HyperStore Object solution combines robust availability with system management control, monitoring capabilities and reporting. 
The list of features, including hybrid cloud streaming, virtual nodes, configurable erasure coding, and data compression, as well as encryption, helps set Cloudian HyperStore apart with highly efficient storage and seamless data management. This lets users store and access their data where they want it, when they want it. Built on a robust object storage platform for effortless data sharing, cloud service providers around the world use Cloudian HyperStore to deploy and manage both public and private clouds, while enterprises rely on it to maintain their private and hybrid clouds.
Infinitely Scalable on Demand
Cisco and Cloudian HyperStore offers on-demand infinite scalability, allowing you to grow your storage as needed. As your demand grows, you can seamlessly grow your storage across multiple DCs.
Security
Cisco and Cloudian HyperStore takes safeguarding customer data very seriously. Two server-side encryption methods (SSE/SSE-c, KeySecure) are implemented to ensure that data is protected at all times.
Cloudian HyperStore simplifies the data encryption process by providing transparent key management at the server or node layer. This relieves administrators from the burden of having to manage encryption keys and eliminates the risk of data loss occurring due to lost keys. Furthermore, encryption can be managed very granularly—from a large-scale to an individual object.
Data Protection
With the ISA-L Powered Erasure Coding, Cloudian HyperStore optimizes storage for all data objects, providing efficient storage redundancy with low disk space consumption.
Effortless Data Movement
Cloudian HyperStore easily manages your data, stores and retrieves your data on-demand (with unique features like object streaming, dynamic auto-tiering), and seamlessly moves data between your on-premises cloud and Amazon S3, irrespective of data size.
Solution Design
Deployment Architecture
The reference architecture use case provides a comprehensive, end-to-end example of designing and deploying Cloudian object storage on Cisco UCS S3260 as shown in Figure 11. This document describes the architecture and design of a Cloudian Scale-out object storage and file system solution on three Cisco UCS S3260 Storage Server Chassis'; each with two Cisco UCS S3260 M5 nodes configured as storage servers and one Cisco UCS C220 M5S rack server as Supervisor node. The whole solution is connected to a pair of Cisco UCS 6332 Fabric Interconnects and a pair of upstream network Cisco Nexus 9332PQ switches.

The following sections describe some considerations for the design of the Infrastructure and the Cloudian HyperStore.
Requirements
The requirements for the storage have to be understood for the design. These may include the total usable space, future expansion and organic growth for the capacity of the cluster, the performance of the cluster in terms of throughput and bandwidth, the average block size of IO, single site, multi-domain or multi-site requirements, and so on.
Physical Infrastructure Considerations
Single Node versus Dual Node Cisco UCS S3260
Cisco UCS S3260 is offered with single node and dual node configurations for a full chassis in a 4RU rack space.
Cluster may be categorized as capacity-based or performance-based depending on the requirements. A dual server offers double the CPU and memory for the same set of disks. So, when performance is more important, a dual node configuration is recommended.
When performance is not that important and fewer cores per disk suffice as in backup or archives, a single node configuration is recommended. This also reduces the TCO of the solution.
Replication versus Erasure Coding
Central to Cloudian’s data protection are its storage policies. These policies are ways of protecting data so that it’s durable and highly available to users. The Cloudian HyperStore system lets you preconfigure one or more storage policies. Users, when creating a new storage bucket, can choose which preconfigured storage policy to use to protect data in that bucket. Users cannot create buckets until you have created at least one storage policy.
For each storage policy that you create, you can choose from the following two data protection methods:
Replication
With replication, a configurable number of copies of each data object are maintained in the system, and each copy is stored on a different node. For example, with 3X replication 3 copies of each object are stored, with each copy on a different node.
Erasure Coding
With erasure coding, each object is encoded into a configurable number (known as the “k” value) of data fragments plus a configurable number (the “m” value) of redundant parity fragments. Each fragment is stored on a different node, and the object can be decoded from any “k” number of fragments. For example, in a 4:2 erasure coding configuration (4 data fragments plus 2 parity fragments), each object is encoded into a total of 6 fragments which are stored on 6 different nodes, and the object can be decoded and read so long as any 4 of those 6 fragments are available.
Erasure coding requires less storage overhead (the amount of storage required for data redundancy) and results in somewhat longer request latency than replication. Erasure coding is best suited to large objects over a low latency network.
Regardless of whether you use replication or erasure coding, if your Cloudian HyperStore system spans multiple datacenters, for each storage policy you can also choose how data is allocated across your datacenters — for example, you could have a storage policy that for each S3 object, store 3 replicas of the object in each of your datacenters; and a second storage policy that erasure codes objects and stores them in just one particular datacenter.
Supported Erasure Coding Configurations
Cloudian HyperStore supports EC, replicated EC, and distributed EC configurations.
·         EC
This configuration requires a minimum 6 nodes across a single Data Centers (DC). This supports the minimum data and parity fragments of (4+2) where 2 is the parity. Table 3  lists the default EC configuration and the default number of nodes for a single DC.
          Cloudian also supports 5 nodes EC as a custom policy – EC3+2.

·         Replicated EC
This configuration requires a minimum of two Data Centers (DC). Each DC consists of 3 nodes each. This supports the minimum data and parity fragments of (2+1) where 1 is the parity. Table 4  lists the default replicated EC configuration and the default number of nodes per DC.

Each object is encoded into equal parts and parity fragments are replicated on each node. Each DC is a mirror image. For configurations greater than 2 DC, Distributed EC configuration is recommended. This configuration mirrors the encoded data and parity fragments to the other data centers in the configuration.
The choice among these three supported EC configurations is largely a matter of how many Cloudian HyperStore nodes in the datacenter. For a replicated EC configuration, a minimum of 3 nodes per DC are required.
·         Distributed EC
Cloudian’s Distributed EC solution implements the new ISA-L Erasure Codes that is vectored and fast. ISA-L is the Intel library containing functions to improve erasure coding.
The Cloudian Distributed Data Center with EC configuration requires a minimum of 3 data centers with 4 nodes each.
Data stored: DC1: 4, Dc2: 4, DC3:4, Metadata stored: Data stored: DC1: 4, DC2: 4, DC3:3
Distributed EC configuration offers the same level of protection as the replicated EC configuration with 50% less storage. The Distributed EC configuration is recommended if number of DCs involved are 3 or more.
Flash Storage
Flash Storage with SAS SSD’s or NVMe’s are used to store metadata for faster performance. The standard capacity requirement for Flash are less than 1 percent of the total data capacity. Standard design also calls for having a ratio of 1 SSD for 16 HDD. When using NVMe, one PCIe card is sufficient for all the drives in the S3260 systems.
For example, a dual node configuration has 28 disk slots for each node, so 2 SSD’s are recommended. Note that using 2 SSD’s reduces the number of slots available per node in S3260 to 28. However, using 1xNVMe as mentioned in the BOM above provides the additional 2 slots when compared with SSD’s. This slightly increases TB/RU of the servers.
JBOD versus RAID0 Disks
While Cloudian HyperStore as a SDS solution works with JBODs or with RAID0 disks, it is recommended to use JBOD for the solution. The 12G SAS RAID controller in S3260 provides up to 4G of cache that can be used for writes.
Memory Sizing
Memory sizing is based on the number of objects stored on each storage server, which is related to the average file size and the data protection scheme. Standard designs call for 384GB for the S3260 M5 single node and 192GB for the S3260 M5 dual node configurations.
Network Considerations
Cloudian Network requirements are standard Ethernet only.  Please refer to the Network layout in Figure 9. While Cloudian software can work on a single network interface, it is recommended to create different virtual interfaces in Cisco UCS and segregate them. A client-access network and private-cluster network are required for the operation. Cisco UCS S3260 has two physical ports of 40G each and the VIC allows you to create out many Virtual interfaces on each physical port.
It is recommended to have a private-cluster network on one port and the client-access networks on another port. This provides 40Gb bandwidth for each of these networks. While the client-access network requirements are minimal, every storage node can take up to 40Gb of client bandwidth requirements. Also, by having the client and cluster VIC’s pinned to each fabric of the fabric interconnects, there is a minimal overhead of network traffic passing through the upstream switches for inter-node communication, if any. This unique feature of fabric interconnects and VIC’s makes the design highly flexible and scalable.
Uplinks
The uplinks from fabric interconnects to upstream switches like Nexus, carry the traffic in case of FI failures or reboots. A reboot for instance is needed during a firmware upgrade. While there is complete high availability built-in the infrastructure, the performance may drop, depending on the uplink connectors from each FI to the Nexus vPC pool.  If you want ‘no’ or a ‘minimal drop’, increase the uplink connectors.
Multi-Site Deployments
Similar to Amazon S3, the Cloudian HyperStore system supports the implementation of multiple “service regions.” Setting up the Cloudian HyperStore system to use multiple service regions is optional.
The main benefits of deploying multiple service regions are:
·         Each region has its own independent Cloudian HyperStore geo-cluster for S3 object storage. Consequently, deploying multiple regions is another means of scaling-out your overall Cloudian HyperStore service offering (beyond using multiple nodes and multiple datacenters to scale out a single geo-cluster). In a multi-region deployment, different S3 datasets are stored in each region. Each region has its own token space and there is no data replication across regions.
·         With a multi-region deployment, your service users can choose the service region in which their storage buckets will be created. Users may choose to store their S3 objects in the region that’s geographically closest to them; or they may choose one region rather than another for reasons of regulatory compliance or corporate policy.
          Designing a multi-site is beyond the scope of this document and for simplicity, only a single site deployment test bed is setup. Please contact Cisco and Cloudian if you have multi-site requirements.
            Should a customer’s workload and use case requirements not conform to the assumptions made while building these standard configurations, Cisco and Cloudian can work together to build custom hardware sizing to support the customer’s workload.
Expansion of the Cluster
Cisco UCS hardware, along with Cloudian HyperStore, offers exceptional flexibility in order to scale-out as your requirements change:
·         Cisco UCS 6332 Fabric Interconnects have 32 ports each. Each server is connected to either of the FI’s.  Leaving the uplinks and any other clients directly connected to the Fabrics, 24-28 server nodes can be connected to FI pairs. If more servers are required, you should plan for a multi-domain system.
·         Cisco UCS offers KVM management both in-band and out-of-band. In case out-of-band management is planned, you may have to reserve as many free IP’s as needed for the servers. Planning while designing the cluster makes expansion very straightforward.
·         Cisco UCS provides IP pool management, MAC pool management along with policies that can be defined once for the cluster. Any future expansion for adding nodes and so on, is just a matter of expanding the above pools.
·         Cisco UCS is a template and policy based infrastructure management tool. All the identity of the servers is stored through Service Profiles that are cloned from templates. When a template is created, a new service profile for the additional server, can be created and applied on the newly added hardware. Cisco UCS makes Infrastructure readiness, extremely simple, for any newly added storage nodes. Rack the nodes, connect the cables, and then clone and apply the service profile.
·         When the nodes are ready, you may have to follow the node addition procedure per the Cloudian documentation.
The simplified management of the infrastructure with Cisco UCS and well-tested node addition from Cloudian makes the expansion of the cluster very simple.
