Legal Information
    This document describes the features, issues, and deployment guidelines for Cisco Multi-Site Orchestrator software.
Cisco Multi-Site is an architecture that allows you to interconnect separate Cisco APIC, Cloud APIC, and DCNM domains (fabrics) each representing a different region. This helps ensure multitenant Layer 2 and Layer 3 network connectivity across sites and extends the policy domain end-to-end across the entire system.
Cisco Multi-Site Orchestrator is the intersite policy manager. It provides single-pane management that enables you to monitor the health of all the interconnected sites. It also allows you to centrally define the intersite configurations and policies that can then be pushed to the different Cisco APIC, Cloud APIC, or DCNM fabrics, which in term deploy them in those fabrics. This provides a high degree of control over when and where to deploy the configurations.
For more information, see the “Related Content” section of this document.
Note: The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.

New Software Features
This release adds the following new features:
Feature
Description
Multi-Site Orchestrator and Nexus Dashboard Integration
Multi-Site Orchestrator can now be deployed as an application on the Nexus Dashboard platform.
For additional information, see Cisco Multi-Site Deployment Guide.
Multi-Site and DCNM Integration
Cisco Multi-Site now supports intersite connectivity between DCNM fabrics and allows you to configure VRFs and Network for those fabrics.
For additional information, see Cisco Multi-Site Configuration Guide for DCNM Fabrics.
New Hardware Features
There is no new hardware supported in this release.
The complete list of supported hardware is available in the Cisco Multi-Site  Hardware Requirements Guide.
Changes in Behavior
If you are upgrading to this release, you will see the following changes in behavior:
●      For all new deployments, you must install the Multi-Site Orchestrator application in Nexus Dashboard.
Release 3.2(1) supports physical Nexus Dashboard clusters only.
●      If you are upgrading your existing deployment to Release 3.2(1) or later, you must deploy a new Nexus Dashboard cluster and migrate your existing configuration.
The procedure is described in detail in Cisco Multi-Site Deployment Guide.
●      Downgrading to releases prior to Release 3.2(1) is not supported.
If you want to revert to an earlier release, you must deploy a brand-new cluster using that release and restore the older configuration backup.
●      Release 3.2(1) supports managing Cisco APIC and Cisco DCNM sites only.
On-boarding Cisco Cloud APIC sites will be supported in future Multi-Site Orchestrator releases.
●      Site management and on-boarding have moved to a centralized location in the Nexus Dashboard GUI.
When migrating to Release 3.2(1), you will need to on-board the sites using the Nexus Dashboard GUI before restoring existing configuration. The procedure is described in detail in Cisco Multi-Site Deployment Guide.
●      User management and authentication have moved to a centralized location in the Nexus Dashboard GUI.
Existing local users will be transferred to the Nexus Dashboard during configuration import.
For existing remote authentication users, you will need to add the remote authentication server to the Nexus Dashboard as described in the Nexus Dashboard User Guide.

For Cisco Multi-Site , Fabric IDs Must be the Same for All Sites, or the Querier IP address Must be Higher on One Site.
The Cisco APIC fabric querier functions have a distributed architecture, where each leaf switch acts as a querier, and packets are flooded. A copy is also replicated to the fabric port. There is an Access Control List (ACL) configured on each TOR to drop this query packet coming from the fabric port. If the source MAC address is the fabric MAC address, unique per fabric, then the MAC address is derived from the fabric-id. The fabric ID is configured by users during initial bring up of a pod site.
In the Cisco Multi-Site  Stretched BD with Layer 2 Broadcast Extension use case, the query packets from each TOR get to the other sites and should be dropped. If the fabric-id is configured differently on the sites, it is not possible to drop them.
To avoid this, configure the fabric IDs the same on each site, or the querier IP address on one of the sites should be higher than on the other sites.
CSCvd61787
STP and "Flood in Encapsulation" Option are not Supported with Cisco Multi-Site.
In Cisco Multi-Site topologies, regardless of whether EPGs are stretched between sites or localized, STP packets do not reach remote sites. Similarly, the "Flood in Encapsulation" option is not supported across sites. In both cases, packets are encapsulated using an FD VNID (fab-encap) of the access VLAN on the ingress TOR. It is a known issue that there is no capability to translate these IDs on the remote sites.
CSCvi61260
If an infra L3Out that is being managed by Cisco Multi-Site is modified locally in a Cisco APIC, Cisco Multi-Site might delete the objects not managed by Cisco Multi-Site  in an L3Out.
CSCvq07769
"Phone Number" field is required in all releases prior to Release 2.2(1). Users with no phone number specified in Release 2.2(1) or later will not be able to log in to the GUI when Orchestrator is downgraded to an earlier release.
CSCvu71584
Routes are not programmed on CSR and the contract config is not pushed to the Cloud site.
Compatibility
This release supports the hardware listed in the Cisco Multi-Site Hardware Requirements Guide.
Multi-Site Orchestrator releases are not dependent on the fabric controller releases. The fabrics and the Multi-Site Orchestrator itself can be upgraded independently of each other and run in mixed operation mode. For more information, see the Interoperability Support section in the  “Infrastructure Management” chapter of the Cisco Multi-Site Deployment Guide.
Release 3.2(1) supports Multi-Site Orchestrator deployments in Cisco Nexus Dashboard only. The VMware ESX (.ova) and Cisco Application Services Engine (.aci) form factors have been deprecated.
Release 3.2(1) supports managing Cisco APIC and Cisco DCNM sites only. On-boarding Cisco Cloud APIC sites will be supported in future releases.
Scalability
