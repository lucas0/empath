Release 1.3.0-241
Release 2.0.0-550
Release 2.0.0-550
Release 2.0.1-1
Release 2.0.1-1
Release 2.1.0-1077
Release 2.1.0-1077
Release 2.1.1-18
Note Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Reporter build 2.0.1-1 is the only supported build for Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Release 2.1. If you are using Reporter build 2.0.0-365, you must upgrade to 2.0.1-1.
SDK Compatibility with Streamer and Reporter
Table 17 describes the supported SVM Streamer and Reporter versions supported by the Cisco StadiumVision Mobile SDK. Cisco StadiumVision Mobile SDK 2.1.1 requires the in-venue SVM Streamer to also be running 2.1.1. The Cisco StadiumVision Mobile SDK Release 2.1.0 is not compatible with Cisco StadiumVision Streamer 2.0.
Note It is important that the release of any mobile app that is using SDK 2.1 be aligned with the server upgrade schedule at its targeted venue. Careful upgrade planning is required because customer apps running SDK 1.3 are not supported on Cisco SVM Streamer 2.1.
Consider the following best practice to account for any application that may be based on SVM SDK 1.3. Please keep in mind that apps based on SVM SDK 1.3 are not supported on Cisco SVM Streamer 2.1.
1. Create a unique triplet in Streamer so that the 1.3 clients do not receive the Cisco StadiumVision Mobile service. By changing the triplet, a triplet mismatch is forced and as a result the service to 1.3 clients is blocked.
2. Coordinate the rebuild of the SVM-based app using the new triplet and app store posting of the app with the SVM Streamer upgrade.
Apps developed with SDK 2.0 are compatible with SVM Streamer 2.1, however these apps are unable to decode streams which are configured with the enhanced FEC option. This FEC option should be used only where the SDK 2.1 has been deployed.

Installation and Upgrade Files
Cisco StadiumVision Mobile software is provided in the form of ISO files. ISO files are packaged images that are available in two versions:
An ISO full image—The full ISO file is to be installed only on brand new Cisco StadiumVision Mobile servers that have no prior Cisco StadiumVision Mobile software version installed.
An ISO upgrade image—The upgrade ISO file is built for processing using the Software Manager.
Note After performing a fresh installation, be sure to reboot the Streamer or restart the Streamer service.
For upgrade instructions using the web browser UI, see the “Using the Software Manager to Upgrade Cisco StadiumVision Reporter Software” module in the Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Reporter and Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Streamer Installation and Upgrade Guide available at:
http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/Sports_Entertainment/StadiumVision/Mobile/software/installation/guide/2_1/stadiumvision_mobile_installation_guide/manage_software_upgrade_svm.html
NTP Server Configuration
If you are running Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Streamer or Reporter as a leaf node in a NTP network (as most are) then you should remove the undisciplined local clock to avoid having two clock sources. To remove the undisciplined local clock, change /etc/ntp.conf using the TUI (Main Menu > System Settings > Date and Time Settings > Modify NTP configuration file).
Delete the following section to remove the undisciplined clock:
# Undisciplined Local Clock. This is a fake driver intended for backup
# and when no outside source of synchronized time is available.
server 127.127.1.0 # local clock
fudge 127.127.1.0 stratum 10
  Note Remove the undisciplined local clock on any new installation or upgrade that sets an NTP server.
Confirming the CIMC Firmware Version
When installing Cisco StadiumVision Mobile on a Cisco UCS C220 server, refer to “ Appendix A: CIMC Configuration and Firmware Upgrade Guidelines on the Cisco UCS C220 Server ” in the Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Reporter and Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Streamer Installation and Upgrade Guide to verify the CIMC firmware version prior to installation.
Installation Requirements for Licensing Compliance
To maintain software licensing compliance, Cisco StadiumVision Mobile servers must be installed in the following manner:
The Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Reporter or Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Streamer server is installed in a data center or in an enterprise data closet.
Limitations and Restrictions
Be aware of the following limitations and restrictions in Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Release 2.1:
Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Reporter
When entering event names into the event spreadsheet on the Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Reporter, if special characters (\, $, %) are used in the event names, the menu item representing the event being viewed is NOT highlighted.
The Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Reporter supports a single season only.
The Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Reporter redundancy can be provided via a warm standby secondary server only. There is no automated failover or redundancy. Also, no automatic data replication occurs between the primary and secondary reporters.
If the Prime Infrastructure (PI) configuration is removed, the svmreporter service must be restarted. See the “Services Control” section in the Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Reporter Administration Guide for details available at:
http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/Sports_Entertainment/StadiumVision/Mobile/admin/guides/server/2-0/reporter/sv-mobile-reporter-admin/svm-reporter-tui.html
When Prime Infrastructure (PI) is not configured, the following reports are affected:
– SVM Wi-Fi Client will show zero (0) for all the values.
– The Uptake Scorecard will not display anything.
The event name, start and end date should not be changed once an event has started. For future events, it is acceptable to change the event name, start and end date.
Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Streamer
Audio and video channels can be set for up to 1000% repair for testing purposes only. Allocating this much protection on any one channel will consume all of the available bandwidth, leaving no room for other channels.
The Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Streamer supports content access control for multiple owners. However, the Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Reporter does not provide reporting on a per content owner basis.
The Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Streamer redundancy can be provided via a warm standby secondary server only. There is no automated failover or redundancy.
Cisco StadiumVision Mobile SDK
The Cisco StadiumVision Mobile SDK supports audio channels on Google Android only. Audio channels are not supported by the iOS or Windows Phone SDKs.
Cisco StadiumVision Mobile SDK Release 2.1 supports iOS 64-bit, however the SVM SDK for iOS only includes support for the 32-bit simulator and does not provide 64-bit simulator support.
The Windows Demo app does not support EVS C-Cast.
The Windows Phone SDK does not include x86 support, and therefore will not run in the emulator.
When using the Cisco StadiumVision Mobile API to pass content from the command line, consider the following:
– All URLs need to encode reserved characters. For example, a “ ” (space) becomes “%20” and a “+” becomes “%2B”.
– Expect the “+” at the Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Streamer to change to a “ ” (space) on the client SDK.
