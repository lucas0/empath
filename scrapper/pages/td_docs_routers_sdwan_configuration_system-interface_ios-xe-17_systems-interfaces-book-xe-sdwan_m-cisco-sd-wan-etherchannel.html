Benefits of Cisco SD-WAN EtherChannel
Provides fault-tolerance. If any one of the links in an EtherChannel fail, the EtherChannel automatically redistributes traffic across the remaining links.
Helps increase bandwidth between Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices and other devices such as switches and servers that are connected in a network.
Information About Cisco SD-WAN EtherChannel
An EtherChannel provides fault-tolerant high-speed links between switches, routers, and servers. You can use the EtherChannel to increase bandwidth between the wiring closets and the data center, and also deploy it at any place in a network where bottlenecks are likely to occur. An EtherChannel provides automatic recovery for the loss of a link by redistributing the load across the remaining links. If a link fails, an EtherChannel redirects traffic from the failed link to the remaining links in the channel.
An EtherChannel comprises a channel group and a port-channel interface. The channel group binds physical ports to the port-channel interface. Configuration changes applied to the port-channel interface apply to all the physical ports bound together in the channel group.
EtherChannel on Service-Side VPN
To create an EtherChannel, begin by configuring a port channel. A port channel is a logical interface on a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device. After you create an EtherChannel, the configuration changes that are applied to the port-channel interface are also applied to all the physical ports assigned to the port-channel interface. The maximum supported range for a port channel interfaces is 1 to 64.
You can configure an EtherChannel using one these methods:
Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) mode
Static mode
Use the LACP mode to configure an EtherChannel if it is supported on both ends of a device. If either of the device does not support LACP mode, use a static mode to configure an EtherChannel.
LACP Mode
LACP facilitates the automatic creation of EtherChannels by exchanging LACP packets between the Ethernet ports.
This table shows the user-configurable EtherChannel LACP modes.
Table 2. EtherChannel LACP Modes
Mode
Description
active
Places a port in an active negotiating state in which the port starts negotiations with other ports by sending LACP packets.
passive
Places a port in a passive negotiating state in which the port responds to the packets that it receives, but does not start LACP packet negotiation. This setting minimizes the transmission of LACP packets.
Both the active and passive modes enable ports to negotiate with partner ports based on port speed.
Ports can form an EtherChannel when they are in different LACP modes as long as the modes are compatible. For example:
A port in the active mode can form an EtherChannel with another port that is in the active or passive mode.
A port in the passive mode cannot form an EtherChannel with another port that is also in the passive mode because neither port starts LACP negotiation.
Static Mode
You can manually create an EtherChannel by using the interface port-channel command in the global configuration mode. You then use the channel-group interface command in the global configuration mode to assign an interface to the EtherChannel. After you configure an EtherChannel, the configuration changes applied to the port-channel interface are applied to all the physical ports assigned to the port-channel interface. Unlike an LACP mode, in a static mode, no packets are sent for negotiations with the other ports. Instead, you must manually configure the ports as part of an EtherChannel.
EtherChannel Load Balancing
An EtherChannel balances traffic load across the links in a channel. You can specify one of several different load-balancing modes. EtherChannels can use either dynamic flow-based load balancing or virtual LAN (VLAN) manual load balancing.
You can configure the load-balancing method globally for all the port channels or directly on specific port channels. The global configuration applies only to those port channels for which you have not explicitly configured load balancing. The port-channel configuration overrides the global configuration.
The following load-balancing methods are supported on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices:
Flow-Based
VLAN-Based
Flow-Based Load Balancing
Flow-based load balancing is the default load-balancing method, and is enabled by default at the global level. Flow-based load balancing identifies different flows of traffic based on the key fields in the data packet. For example, IPv4 source and destination IP addresses can be used to identify a flow. The various data traffic flows are then mapped to the different member links of a port channel. After the mapping is done, the data traffic for a flow is transmitted through the assigned member link. The flow mapping is dynamic and changes when there is any change in the state of a member link to which a flow is assigned. The flow mapping is dynamic when member links are added or deleted.
VLAN-Based Load Balancing
VLAN-based load balancing allows you to configure static assignment of user traffic, as identified by a VLAN ID, to a given member link of an EtherChannel. You can manually assign VLAN subinterfaces to a primary and secondary link. This feature allows load balancing to downstream equipment regardless of vendor equipment capabilities, and provides failover protection by redirecting traffic to the secondary member link if the primary link fails. Member links are supported with up to 16 bundles per chassis.
Use Cases for Cisco SD-WAN EtherChannel
You can configure Etherchannels on the service-side VPN because they can provide increased bandwidth and resilience in a network.
Increased Bandwidth
An EtherChannel allows multiple links to be combined into one logical link. Because an EtherChannel offers redundancy of links, you can configure EtherChannels to increase the speed in a network.
Increased Resilience
An EtherChannel also provides network resiliency. Even if a link within an EtherChannel fails, traffic that is previously carried over the failed link switches to the remaining links within the EtherChannel. Thus, EtherChannel provides automatic recovery for the loss of a link by redistributing the load across the remaining links.
Configure Cisco SD-WAN EtherChannel
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Templates.
Click Device Templates.

Note
In Cisco vManage Release 20.7.x and earlier releases, Device Templates is titled as Device
From Create Template drop-down, choose CLI Template.

Note
You can also use the CLI Add-on template to configure an EtherChannel. For more information, see Create a CLI Add-On Feature Template.
From Device Model, choose a device model for which you are creating the template.
In the Template Name field, enter a name for the device template. This field is mandatory and can contain only uppercase and lowercase letters, the digits 0 to 9, hyphens (-), and underscores (_). It cannot contain spaces or any other characters.
In the Description field, enter a description for the device template. This field is mandatory, and it can contain any character and spaces.
In the CLI Configuration field, enter the EtherChannel configuration by typing it, cutting and pasting it, or uploading a file.
Click Save.
