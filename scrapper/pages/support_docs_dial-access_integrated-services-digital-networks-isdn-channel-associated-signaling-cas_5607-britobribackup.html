Introduction
This configuration demonstrates the use of an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) Basic Rate Interface (BRI) line to backup a leased line connection. The backup interface command places the specified interface into the standby mode until such time as the primary interface goes down. For more information on the features of the backup interface, refer to Evaluating Backup Interfaces, Floating Static Routes, and Dialer Watch for DDR Backup.
Prerequisites
Requirements
It is recommended that you refer to the document Configuring and Troubleshooting DDR Backup for more information.
Components Used
In this scenario we have a Cisco 1604 router connected to a Cisco 3640 router across a serial connection. Both routers are also equipped with BRI interfaces, which are used for the backup link. The Cisco 1604 is running Cisco IOSÂ® Software Release12.1(5)T and the Cisco 3640 is using Cisco IOS 12.1(2).
Note: The concepts in this configuration can be used on any router with BRI and WAN interfaces.
The information presented in this document was created from devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If you are working in a live network, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command before using it.
Background Theory
This example uses legacy Dial on Demand Routing (DDR), which uses the dialer map command for the BRI connection. You can also use dialer profiles instead of legacy DDR. For more information on dialer profiles refer to Configuring ISDN DDR with Dialer Profiles.
Configuring DDR backup involves two distinct steps:
Configure the DDR with either legacy DDR or dialer profiles. Verify that your DDR connection functions correctly before implementing the backup configuration.
Configure the router to initiate the DDR connection when the primary link fails. This configuration uses backup interfaces to trigger the dialout. Refer to Evaluating Backup Interfaces, Floating Static Routes, and Dialer Watch for DDR Backup for more information on the other options.
Conventions

Configure
In this section, you are presented with the information to configure the features described in this document.

Network Diagram
This document uses the network setup shown in the diagram below.
Configurations
This document uses the configurations shown below.
maui-soho-01 (1600)
maui-nas-05 (3640)
This configuration uses a BRI circuit to backup a serial link. This configuration is also using the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol between the two routers. Once the backup connection is activated, you must ensure that the routing table is updated to use the new backup route.
Note:  For more information on command conventions, see the Cisco Technical Tips Conventions.

Verify the following points in the configuration of the client maui-soho-01(1600):
A loopback address is used. This is used so the router id for OSPF will not change and the backup link can establish a peer when it is activated.
The dialer load threshold is set low. This value can be changed if you do not require a 128k multilink backup connection.
Any IP traffic will trigger the dial (based on dialer-list 1 and dialer-group 1). Since the backup link requires interesting traffic to dial the backup link, verify that you do have a traffic source generating interesting traffic. In this example, OSPF hello packets will trigger the dial. If you are not using a routing protocol you can use ICMP pings to dial the backup link. Adjust the interesting traffic depending on your needs.
OSPF is used. You can use any routing protocol you wish. Just make sure that the primary and backup interface networks are included in the routing protocol. If you wish to use static routes instead of a routing protocol, create a static route with the next hop being the remote bri interface (you may have to make it a floating static route depending on the scenario).

Verify the following points in the configuration of the server maui-nas-05 (3640):
A dialer map statement for the remote site is configured. An incorrect dialer map statement could result in routing issues on the connected backup link.
All IP traffic is defined as interesting. This will reset the idle timeout and keep the connection up until the primary comes back up. If you do not require the backup link to be nailed up, you can change this.
Verify
This section provides information you can use to confirm your configuration is working properly.
Certain show commands are supported by the Output Interpreter tool, which allows you to view an analysis of show command output.
show interface bri0 - This indicates whether the BRI interface is up. If the primary link is up, the BRI interface will be in standby. Only when the primary link goes down will the BRI interface be up.
show isdn status - Use this to ensure that the router is properly communicating with the ISDN switch. In the output, verify that Layer 1 Status is ACTIVE, and that the Layer 2 Status state = MULTIPLE_FRAME_ESTABLISHED appears. This command also displays the number of active calls.
Sample show ip route Output
The routing table of the client, maui-soho-01 (1600), with the primary link functioning is shown below:
maui-soho-01#show ip route
Codes: C - connected, S - static, I - IGRP, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP
       D - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter area 
       N1 - OSPF NSSA external type 1, N2 - OSPF NSSA external type 2
       E1 - OSPF external type 1, E2 - OSPF external type 2, E - EGP

The output of show ip route shown above, displays the OSPF routes learned from the peers using the primary link (serial 0). Now we bring down the primary link and activate the backup link.
Note: Issuing the shutdown command on the primary interface will not cause the backup BRI to dial. If you issue a shutdown command to bring down the primary connection , the Cisco IOS software will not automatically bring up a backup connection. You must physically bring down the primary connection by unplugging cables or some equivalent method in order to bring up the backup interfaces.
After the backup link was activated, the OSPF table is exchanged and the new routes using the backup link is installed. Traffic now flows across the backup link. An example of this is shown below:
maui-soho-01#show ip route
Codes: C - connected, S - static, I - IGRP, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP
       D - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter area

Troubleshoot
This section provides information you can use to troubleshoot your configuration.
Troubleshooting Commands
Certain show commands are supported by the Output Interpreter tool, which allows you to view an analysis of show command output.
Note: Before issuing debug commands, please see Important Information on Debug Commands.
debug dialer - This is used to see dial-on-demand routing information.
debug isdn events - This is used to see ISDN activity occurring on the user side of the ISDN interface.
debug isdn q931 - This shows call setup and tear down of the ISDN network connection (Layer 3) and can be used to isolate problems.
debug ppp negotiation - This displays information on PPP traffic and exchanges while negotiating the PPP components including Link Control Protocol (LCP), Authentication, and Network Control Protocol (NCP). A successful PPP negotiation will first open the LCP state, then authenticate, and finally negotiate the NCP.
debug ppp authentication - This displays the PPP authentication protocol messages, including Challenge Authentication Protocol (CHAP) packet exchanges and Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) exchanges. If you observe a failure verify that the chap username and password are configured correctly.
debug ppp error - This displays protocol errors and error statistics associated with PPP connection negotiation and operation.
