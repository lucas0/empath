    Empower contact center supervisors to optimize agent performance and customer satisfaction
For many businesses, the contact center is a strategic connection point with customers. Each positive customer experience supports corporate business objectives, such as increased sales and customer loyalty. But with the daily pressure to satisfy customer demands, it can be a challenge to keep contact center people and processes aligned with corporate business objectives— whether it is in sales performance or profitability.
To manage these expectations, it is the contact center supervisor who must deliver. It is the supervisor’s job to balance the goals of the business with the customer experience and agent behavior. To help companies provide efficient, effective, customer-focused service in the contact center, supervisors must have the tools they need to manage team performance.
Webex® Workforce Optimization transforms the supervisor experience, giving supervisors access to more data and more powerful tools in simplified and flexible views so they are better equipped to lead their teams in delivering exceptional customer experiences.
The powerful Webex Workforce Optimization suite of applications includes:
●      Call Recording and Quality Management
●      Workforce Management
●      Analytics
Suite of Applications
Call Recording and Quality Management
The call recording and quality management component of Webex Workforce Optimization is a highly scalable voice and screen call recording and quality evaluation solution that supports agents, knowledge workers, and supervisors at any location.
●      Call Recording enables 100-percent call recording of agents or knowledge workers for compliance and transaction verification and includes on-demand recording and archiving. It also includes the search and play application to find and play back recordings.*
●      Quality Management provides audio and screen call recording, quality evaluations, customizable performance dashboards, and reports.
Key features of the call recording and quality management application include:
●      Voice and screen recording
●      Live voice and screen monitoring*
●      Workflow-based contact recording
●      Configurable quality evaluation forms, including points and percentage- based scoring, section- and question-level weighting, and unlimited number of sections and questions
●      Customizable metadata fields, providing the ability to append important enterprise and customer data to recordings for easy search and retrieval
●      The ability to export calls in bulk for compliance and transaction verification through the recording export application
●      100-percent voice recording for compliance and transaction verification
●      Non-agent or knowledge worker recording
●      The ability to evaluate, score, and report on the quality of customer interactions through any channel (chat, email, social media, etc.)*
●      Evaluation calibration capabilities, enabling contact center managers to benchmark evaluators
●      Configurable and graphical reporting
●      Role-based alerts to streamline evaluation workflows
●      Advanced search capabilities that let you locate recorded calls quickly and easily
●      The ability to export recorded files in .wav or Windows media formats
●      Ease of implementation and use
●      Payment Card Industry (PCI) data security compliance
●      A system monitoring and notification utility that can alert through email or existing Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)-based network monitoring solutions; it can also match recording events to Call Detail Records (CDRs)
●      A real-time recording status application that provides peace of mind that lines are recording*
●      Multiple recording storage locations that help ensure reliability if a server failover occurs
●      Screen recording by workflow and automated screen-only recording
●      Recording service redundancy and load balancing to support fault tolerance*
●      Multi Unified Contact Center Express sync
●      Hyperlink access to recordings, which allows access to the recordings right from the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) database for playback and review
The call recording and quality management software supports three recording methods:*
1.     Desktop recording is a software recording service executed on the recorded user’s PC.
2.     Network-based recording uses a recording server that receives telephony packets directed to it from the built-in bridge on the recorded user’s IP phone under the direction of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (UCM) and controlled by the recording workflow on the recording server processing the user’s CTI events.
3.     Cisco Unified Border Element (CUBE) gateway recording includes media forking from CUBE to a record server, which then encrypts and uploads into the call recording and quality management system per the user’s workflow configuration.
Webex Workforce Optimization call recording and quality management includes:
●      Enhanced user experience for agent, supervisor, and evaluator roles
●      A speech energy bar, including a timeline, visual comments, and metadata tagging, which speeds the quality analysis process and provides additional context to evaluations
●      Speech energy data for talk-over and silence, which allows evaluators to quickly flag potential customer service concerns*
●      Agent self-evaluation options
●      Agent hot desking or hoteling and extension mobility for non-agents, which frees a user from having to work at a particular location or on a particular device*
For all call recording types, transactions of interest are selected and processed if they meet established business criteria such as:
●      Supervisors review and score the transactions against critical performance metrics, creating initiatives for quality improvements and training.
●      Individual and team performance reports show trends that promote initiatives for quality improvement and training at the team and agent levels
●      Real calls can be used to create best-practice training modules for an existing agent coaching system. As part of Webex Workforce Optimization that also includes workforce management, and AI-fueled analytics, the call recording and quality management software streamlines the quality management process to help ensure that standards are being met and that training and improvements are implemented when required

Workforce Management (WFM)
A modern workforce management solution should do more than just digitize scheduling. It should help your people work smarter. It should help you make your people better. Webex Workforce Optimization workforce management gives you the toolset to get the very best from your people. Free managers from tedious scheduling so they can focus on strategic improvements and engage with real-time feedback and gamification.
When the average contact center spends 65 percent of its budget on human capital resources, balanced staffing can significantly influence customer service, customer satisfaction, efficiency, and costs. Yet workforce management can be complex for many contact centers—particularly smaller centers that cannot afford high-end packaged solutions. Workforce management offers simple integration: it is easy to learn and simple for managers and supervisors to use.
Figure 1 shows an example of how contact center managers can quickly access an overview of individual agent performance at any time.
Key features of the workforce management application include:
●      Forecasting and scheduling
●      Real-time adherence management
●      Agent access to schedules and shift trades
●      Multi-skill agent queuing
●      Alerts and notifications
●      Automated request approvals
●      An agent schedule view for supervisors, which provides agent and team schedules, adherence, and a coverage view on a single, unified screen
