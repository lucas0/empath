Static Route Tracker for Service VPNs
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1
This feature enables you to configure IPv4 static route endpoint tracking for service VPNs.
For static routes, endpoint tracking determines whether the configured endpoint is reachable before adding that route to the route table of the device.
TCP/UDP Endpoint Tracker and Dual Endpoint Static Route Tracker for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1
This feature enables you to configure the TCP/UDP static route endpoint trackers. Using this feature you can also configure IPv4, TCP/UDP dual endpoint static-route tracker groups for service VPNs to enhance the reliability of probes.

Information About Static Route Tracking
Static-route tracking for service VPNs enables you to track the availability of the configured endpoint address to determine if the static route can be included in the routing table of a device. This is applicable when a site uses a static route in a service VPN to advertise its route over Overlay Management Protocol (OMP). The static route tracker periodically sends ICMP ping probes to the configured endpoint. If the tracker does not receive a response, the static route is not included in the routing table and is not advertised to OMP. You can configure an alternative next-hop address or a static route with a higher administrative distance to provide a backup path. This path is advertised over OMP.

Note
From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.1a, you can configure TCP/UDP individual endpoint trackers and configure a tracker group with dual endpoints (using two trackers), and associate the trackers and tracker group to a static route. Dual endpoints help in avoiding false negatives that might be introduced because of the unavailability of the routes.
Supported Platforms
Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregated Services Routers
Cisco ISR 1000 Series-Integrated Services Routers
Cisco ISR 4000 Series Integrated Services Routers
Cisco CSR 1000 Series Cloud Service Routers
Restrictions for IPv4 Static Route Tracking
Only one endpoint tracker is supported per static route per next-hop address.
IPv6 static routes are not supported.
To configure a static route with tracker:
Delete any existing static route, if it is already configured without a tracker. Plan for any connectivity downtime that might occur during this step for static route advertisement.
Configure a new static route with tracker using the same prefix and next-hop as the deleted static route.
To add a new tracker after you reach maximum tracker limit per router:
Delete an old tracker and attach the template to the device.
Add a new tracker and attach the device to the template again.
UDP tracker endpoint enabled with IP SLA UDP packet responder is supported only on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
You cannot link the same endpoint-tracker to static routes in different VPNs. Endpoint-tracker is identified by a name and can be used for multiple static routes in a single VPN.
Workflow to Configure IPv4 Static Route Tracking
Configure an endpoint tracker using the System template.
Configure a static route using the VPN template.
Apply the tracker to the next-hop address.

Threshold
Wait time for the probe to return a response before declaring that the configured endpoint is down. Range is from 100 to 1000 milliseconds. Default is 300 milliseconds.
Interval
Time interval between probes to determine the status of the configured endpoint. Default is 60 seconds (1 minute).
Range is from 20 to 600 seconds.
Multiplier
Number of times probes are sent before declaring that the endpoint is down. Range is from 1 to 10. Default is 3.
Tracker Type
From the drop-down, choose Global. From the Tracker Type field drop-down, choose Static Route.
From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.1a, you can configure a tracker group with dual endpoints on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices and associate this tracker group to a static route.
Endpoint Type
Choose endpoint type IP Address.
End-Point Type: IP Address
IP address of the static route end point. This is the destination on the internet to which the router sends probes to determine the status of the route.
Click Add.
Click Save.
To create a tracker group, click Tracker Groups > New Endpoint Tracker Groups and configure the tracker parameters.

Note
Ensure that you have created two trackers to form a tracker group.
Table 3. Tracker Group Parameters
Fields
Description
Name
Name of the tracker group.
Tracker Type
From the drop-down, choose Global. From the Tracker Type field drop-down, choose Static Route.
From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.1a, you can configure a tracker group with dual endpoints on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices and associate this tracker group to a static route.
Tracker Elements
This field is displayed only if you chose Tracker-group as the tracker type. Add the existing interface tracker names (separated by a space). When you add this tracker to the template, the tracker group is associated with these individual trackers, and you can then associate the tracker group to a static route.
Tracker Boolean
From the drop-down list, choose Global. This field is displayed only if you chose tracker-group as the Tracker Type. By default, the OR option is selected. Choose AND or OR.
OR ensures that the static route status is reported as active if either one of the associated trackers of the tracker group report that the route is active.
If you select AND, the static route status is reported as active if both the associated trackers of the tracker group report that the route is active.
