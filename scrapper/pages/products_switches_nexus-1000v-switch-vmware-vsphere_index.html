The Cisco Nexus 1000V will continue to be supported on the VMware hypervisor beyond VMware vSphere Release 6.0 as well as on other major hypervisors. Customers should upgrade their Cisco Nexus 1000V software to the latest version as they upgrade their VMware or other hypervisor environments.
Features and Capabilities
Important differentiators for the Cisco Nexus 1000V for VMware vSphere include:
Extensive virtual network services built on Cisco advanced service insertion and routing technology
Support for vCloud Director and vSphere hypervisor
Feature and management consistency for easy integration with the physical infrastructure
Exceptional policy and control features for comprehensive networking functionality
Policy management and control by the networking team instead of the server virtualization team (separation of duties)
Use Virtual Networking Services
The Cisco Nexus 1000V Switch optimizes the use of Layer 4 - 7 virtual networking services in virtual machine and cloud environments through Cisco vPath architecture services.
Cisco vPath 2.0 supports service chaining so you can use multiple virtual network services as part of a single traffic flow. For example, you can simply specify the network policy, and vPath 2.0 can direct traffic:
First, through the Cisco ASA1000V Cloud Firewall for tenant edge security
Then, through the Cisco Virtual Security Gateway for Nexus 1000V Switch for a zoning firewall
In addition, Cisco vPath works on VXLAN to support movement between servers in different Layer 2 domains. Together, these features promote highly secure policy, application, and service delivery in the cloud.
Expand these offerings by building highly secure hybrid clouds with Cisco InterCloud.
