An invalid entry appears in red color.
Click Select All to check the Delete checkbox for all entries. Click DeSelect All to uncheck the Delete checkbox for all entries.
Click the Refresh button to refresh data on the current page.
Check the Auto Refresh checkbox to refresh a page every 10 seconds. Uncheck the checkbox to disable auto refresh.
Check the Apply All checkbox at the bottom of a page or pane to apply the value entered in a current field to all entries in that page or pane. For example, in the DS384 3 Video Qam Channel Configuration pane, select the desired value from Cable Mode in one row (row changes to yellow color) and check the Cable Mode Apply All checkbox to apply the selected value to all Cable Mode fields in the pane. The checkbox is disabled when multiple rows are in edit mode.
Note You must check the Apply All checkbox while applying the changes.
A QAM channel configuration cannot be edited after it is assigned to a QAM replication group.
Every page and pane with configurable fields have validation embedded in them. A common javascript validation occurs and appropriate messages are displayed in a popup window.
A confirmation message is displayed each time you click the Delete button.
Use the navigation icons (|<<, <<, >>, >>|) or check the Show All checkbox at the top of a pane to view data presented across multiple pages.
Click a header field (hyperlink appears on mouse-over) to sort the content either in ascending or descending order.
Some pages or panes show the current LED status. See the relevant hardware documentation to interpret the LED status.
It is recommended that before the Copy process is initiated, the destination RF Port should be set to default. This is done by checking the Default checkbox on the destination RF Port configuration pane.This ensures that the Copy process runs smoothly without any error messages.
Action buttons such as Apply, Clear New, Delete are enabled only after the corresponding action like entering data in the fields or selecting a row is performed. Until then they are disabled.

To configure the Cisco RFGW-10 UEQAM with a local username and password, use the following command in global configuration mode:
Router(config)# username name [privilege level] password encryption-type password
  The level is a number between 0 and 15 that specifies the privilege level for the user. You can specify up to sixteen privilege levels, using numbers 0 through 15. Level 1 is normal EXEC-mode user privileges and 15 is the enable privileges.
Note The Cisco RFGW-10 GUI allows only privilege level 15 users to log in to the GUI application.
The encryption-type is a single-digit number that defines whether the text immediately following is encrypted, and, if so, what type of encryption is used. Currently the defined encryption types are 0 and 7; 0 means that the text which follows immediately is not encrypted, and 7 means that the text is encrypted using a Cisco-defined encryption algorithm.
If the HTTP server is not enabled in the Cisco RFGW-10 UEQAM chassis, the GUI does not display any information because there is no communication with the chassis.
For accessing GUI with read only feature, user name and password must be created with the following cli:
Router(config)# username guest privilege 15 secret 0 [password]

Troubleshooting Tips
Symptom Unable to connect to the web interface.
Possible Cause The Cisco RFGW-10 IP address is not reachable.
Recommended Action Access the application using a web browser that has IP connectivity to the chassis. The assigned IP address should be reachable from the client system, otherwise check the IP address configuration.
Possible Cause The Cisco RFGW-10 IP address interface is not up.
Recommended Action Make sure that the assigned IP address IP interface is up and active.
Possible Cause Incomplete HTTP server start-up or is not enabled.
Recommended Action Ensure that the Cisco RFGW-10 system boots successfully by verifying the prompt mode in the console. Connect to the web client after verifying this status. To enable the HTTP server on your system, use the ip http server or ip http secure-server command in global configuration mode. To disable the HTTP server, use the no form of this command.
Possible Cause Incorrect URL.
Recommended Action The GUI server and the web interface communicate through HTTP/HTTPS. Ensure that the URL protocol and IP address are correct. The URL is either http://<rfgw-ip-address> or https://<rfgw-ip-address>. Include the portnumber if it is configured.
Symptom Unable to change the default port 80 occupied by the Cisco RFGW-10 GUI.
Recommended Action Do the following:
1. Specify the port number to be used by the HTTP server using the ip http port portnumber command in global configuration mode. Return the port number to its default using the no form of this command. The valid range is from 1025 to 65535.
2. Change the URL to http://<rfgw-ip-address>:portnumber.
Symptom Five small square boxes are displayed at the top of a blank page while trying to connect to the web interface.
Possible Cause The URL used to connect to the web interface is http://<rfgw-ip-address> whereas a secure connection is required.
Recommended Action Use https://<rfgw-ip-address> URL to connect to the web interface.
Symptom Forgot password for logging into the web interface.
Recommended Action Contact your administrator to generate the credentials.
Symptom The web interface display is distorted.
Possible Cause Browser is not compatible.
Recommended Action See the “Connecting the Cisco RFGW-10 Using a Web Browser” section.
Possible Cause JavaScript is not enabled.
Recommended Action Enable javascript in your browser.
Symptom Alignment in web interface is not proper.
Possible Cause Browser cache issue.
Recommended Action Close all browser instances, clear the cache and cookies, and then connect to a new instance. If the problem persists, contact the Cisco RFGW-10 GUI support personnel.
Symptom Unable to view the GUI.
Possible Cause Browser is not compatible.
Recommended Action See the “Connecting the Cisco RFGW-10 Using a Web Browser” section.
Possible Cause The display setting is not compatible.
Recommended Action Set the display resolution to 1024 x 768 or higher.
Symptom Unable to log into the GUI.
Possible Cause The user level is not assigned.
Recommended Action Assign a user level for the credential and then log into the GUI.
Possible Cause The user level assigned is not sufficient or correct.
Recommended Action If you have a valid user ID and password but are still unable to log in even after multiple attempts, ask your administrator to review your user level assignment.
Symptom Unable / Trouble to log into the GUI and no action while clicking on menu tab.
Possible Cause Browser cache issue.
Recommended Action Close all browser instances, clear the cache and cookies, and then connect to a new instance.
Possible Cause User mode.
Recommended Action Enter only proper IP address, do not try to enter any manual URL.
Symptom A slow network response or a script not responding error message is displayed after logging into the system.
Possible Cause Performance issues.
Recommended Action Click Continue if you get the script not responding error message asking if you wish to continue or cancel. After sometime, the GUI page is displayed. Such messages indicate a slow network link between your system and the server. Ping the server to check the round trip response time. Consider using a caching HTTP proxy to improve speed and reduce network traffic.
Symptom Common browser error messages.
Possible Cause These are some of the possible causes:
– HTTP status code 401—Indicates that authentication is required, and has failed or not yet been provided.
– HTTP status code 403—Indicates that a request is not authorized. Perhaps the current user does not have the required permissions.
– HTTP status code 404—Indicates that the requested URL cannot be found. Check if the action names are spelled correctly.
– HTTP status code 500—Indicates that a server error occurred while processing the request.
Recommended Action If the problem persists, contact the Cisco RFGW-10 GUI support personnel.
Symptom GUI shows incorrect output.
Recommended Action Verify the output on the chassis console using the appropriate command. If there is a mismatch in the output, contact the Cisco RFGW-10 GUI support personnel.
Symptom Incorrect supervisor card, line card, or QAM channel information is displayed.
Possible Cause The QAM carrier was downgraded or upgraded, a redundancy group configuration was changed, a switch over occurred, or the supervisor card or line card was removed, inserted or shut down.
Recommended Action Reload the GUI by clicking Restart on the banner to populate the current chassis configuration.
