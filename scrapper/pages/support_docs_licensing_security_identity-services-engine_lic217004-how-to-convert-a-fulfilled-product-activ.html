Converting a Fulfilled PAK to a Smart License for ISE
Step 1: 
Go to Cisco Software Central and log in with your Cisco.com account.
Step 2:
In the Traditional Licenses section, click Access LRP.
Step 3:
In the Show Smart Account and Virtual Account drop-down lists, confirm that the correct respective accounts are selected.

On the PAKs or Tokens tab, select a product activation key (PAK) with the Fulfilled status that you want to convert to a Smart license. Click the blue circled chevron icon and select Get PAK or Token information.
Note: Notice that when you click the blue circled chevron icon, the Convert to Smart Licensing option is not available from here.
(Optional) Step 5:
In the PAK/Token dialog box, click the Devices tab, and then copy the Primary Serial Number. Close the dialog box.

In the Convert to Smart Entitlements dialog box, select your Virtual Account from the drop-down list, select the check box next to the stock keeping unit (SKU), and then click Submit.
Note: If more than one product activation keys (PAKs) are associated with the device, then you can select some or all licenses to be converted in the Convert to Smart Entitlements dialog box.
Step 9:
When the system displays the License Request Status dialog box with the message about successful conversion, note down the Transaction ID, and then click Close
Note: Once you convert the fulfilled product activation key (PAK) to a Smart License, the device that the traditional license was assigned to disappears from the list of devices.
