  Q.  How does a lack of application visibility impact overall IT operations?
A.  Applications and users are more distributed than ever, and the internet has become the new enterprise WAN. As SD-WAN has transformed to connect users across multicloud, branch, data centers, and a hybrid workforce, enterprises and other organizations are constantly challenged to deliver reliable connectivity, application performance, and security over networks and services they don’t own or directly control.
IT and network teams often carry the burden of proving the network innocent when something goes wrong. Application issues might manifest as network issues. Service disruptions can lead to endless finger-pointing. The resulting cycles spent pinpointing the source of issues can lead to prolonged service interruptions that ultimately damage the revenue and reputation of the business. To empower IT leaders to deliver transformation, they need a network analytics solution that provides visibility, predictivity, and automation to help them simplify network operations over such a dynamic environment.
