AI does the heavy lifting
●      Webex Assistant, your digital in-meeting assistant, will automate common tasks such as real-time transcription, note-taking and meeting highlights, so you can focus on the meeting
●      Language is no longer a barrier with real-time translation—from English to 100+ languages
●      With noise removal and speech enhancement, annoying disruptions like dog barking, lawn mowers, and rustling paper, will be a thing of the past—so you can send the best audio into your meeting
●      People Insights gives you more context with relevant, professional and up-to-date data on your meeting participants
