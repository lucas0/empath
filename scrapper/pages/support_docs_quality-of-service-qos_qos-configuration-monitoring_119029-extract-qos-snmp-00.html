Introduction
This document describes how to extract the various values related to Class Based Quality of Service (QoS) details (CISCO-CLASS-BASED-QOS-MIB) applied against Control Plane with Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Prerequisites
Requirements
Net-SNMP or any similar command line based utility that runs on a UNIX based operating system that polls SNMP Management Information Bases (MIBs) from a Cisco device. Net-SNMP is a 3rd Party Open Source utility available for download here.
Ensure Control Plane Policing (CoPP) is configured.
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
Cisco IOSÂ® Software Release 12.0(3)T or later
Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switch
Cisco SNMP Object Navigator
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Procedure
Get ifindex (1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.1) for the Control Plane as this example output shows:
show snmp mib ifmib ifindex | include Cont

Control Plane: Ifindex = 268
You can also achieve this with SNMP as this example shows:
UNIX #snmpwalk -v2c -c <community-name>  <ip address of device> | grep -i control plane

IF-MIB::ifDescr.268 = STRING: Control Plane
Note in this output that the ifIndex is 268.
Get the cbQosIfindex (1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.166.1.1.1.1.4 for the corresponding IfIndex in the router:
UNIX # snmpwalk -v 2c -c  <community-name>  <ip address of device>
 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.166.1.1.1.1.4 | grep -i 268  

SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.9.9.166.1.1.1.1.4.225 = INTEGER: 268
The cbQosPolicyIndex (1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.166.1.1.1.1.1) is  225.
cbQosCMName (1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.166.1.7.1.1.1) is the MIB Object that retrieves the names of class-maps configured on the router. This results in the output of the various class-maps configured with their indices..For example, cbQosConfigIndex (1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.166.1.5.1.1.2).
UNIX #snmpwalk -v2c -c <community-name> <ip address of device> 
      1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.166.1.7.1.1.1
Example
UNIX # snmpwalk -v2c -c <community-name> <ip address of device> 
       1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.166.1.7.1.1.1 | egrep -i "copp|class"

SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.9.9.166.1.7.1.1.1.1593 = STRING: "class-default"

SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.9.9.166.1.7.1.1.1.274033342 = STRING: "CoPP-IMPORTANT"

SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.9.9.166.1.7.1.1.1.280880137 = STRING: "CoPP-Match-all"

SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.9.9.166.1.7.1.1.1.321645237 = STRING: "CoPP-NORMAL"

SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.9.9.166.1.7.1.1.1.347132543 = STRING: "CoPP-CRITICAL2"

SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.9.9.166.1.7.1.1.1.373457077 = STRING: "CoPP-BAD"

SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.9.9.166.1.7.1.1.1.383240351 = STRING: "CoPP-CRITICAL"
Note the highlighted value of 274033342 which is the cbQosConfigIndex.
Use cbQosConfigIndex in order to fetch the cbQosPolicyIndex (1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.166.1.1.1.1.1) and cbQosObjectsIndex (1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.166.1.5.1.1.1) for the particular class-map. The example in this step shows how to monitor class-map CoPP-IMPORTANT:
UNIX #snmpwalk -v2c -c <community-name> <ip address of device> 
      1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.166.1.5.1.1.2
Get the OID (Object Identifier) output by searching 274033342 (highlighted value taken from Step 3) in this output:
UNIX #snmpwalk -v2c -c <community-name> <ip address of device> 
      1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.166.1.5.1.1.2
Example
UNIX# snmpwalk -v2c -c <community-name>  <ip address of device>
1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.166.1.5.1.1.2 | grep -i 'Gauge32: 274033342'

SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.9.9.166.1.5.1.1.2.225.131072 = Gauge32: 274033342 <<<< Match these value
cbQosConfigIndex is 274033342,  cbQosPolicyIndex is 225 and cbQosObjectsIndex is 131072.
Now  we have various options in order to poll the specific data from the Policy-map:
  +-- -R-- Counter   cbQosCMPrePolicyPktOverflow(1)
   +-- -R-- Counter   cbQosCMPrePolicyPkt(2)
   +-- -R-- Counter64 cbQosCMPrePolicyPkt64(3)
   +-- -R-- Counter   cbQosCMPrePolicyByteOverflow(4)
   +-- -R-- Counter   cbQosCMPrePolicyByte(5)
   +-- -R-- Counter64 cbQosCMPrePolicyByte64(6)
   +-- -R-- Gauge     cbQosCMPrePolicyBitRate(7)
   +-- -R-- Counter   cbQosCMPostPolicyByteOverflow(8)
   +-- -R-- Counter   cbQosCMPostPolicyByte(9)
   +-- -R-- Counter64 cbQosCMPostPolicyByte64(10)
   +-- -R-- Gauge     cbQosCMPostPolicyBitRate(11)
   +-- -R-- Counter   cbQosCMDropPktOverflow(12)
   +-- -R-- Counter   cbQosCMDropPkt(13)
   +-- -R-- Counter64 cbQosCMDropPkt64(14)
   +-- -R-- Counter   cbQosCMDropByteOverflow(15)
   +-- -R-- Counter   cbQosCMDropByte(16)
   +-- -R-- Counter64 cbQosCMDropByte64(17)
   +-- -R-- Gauge     cbQosCMDropBitRate(18)
   +-- -R-- Counter   cbQosCMNoBufDropPktOverflow(19)
   -- -R-- Counter   cbQosCMNoBufDropPkt(20)
   -- -R-- Counter64 cbQosCMNoBufDropPkt64(21)
For example, cbQosCMPostPolicyBitRate (1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.166.1.15.1.1.11) is an object that polls "The bit rate of the traffic after executing QoS policies".
UNIX #snmpwalk -v2c -c <community-name><ip address of device> 
      1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.166.1.15.1.1.11.225.131072

SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.9.9.166.1.15.1.1.11.225.131072 = Gauge32: 12000  
!--- Match this from the output taken from the router for verification.

Also use this procedure in order to find out/confirm the required OID for polling.
Additional Information
You can use SNMP in order to retrieve these counters in relation to platform(s):
6500 - CoPP hardware counters
7600 - CoPP software counters
If you try to get the counters the other way around (hardware counters in place of software counters and vice versa) via SNMP for respective platforms as mentioned, it is not possible. This is because the respective codes are designed this way and understand that you might need to use CLI only in order to get the counters and there is no alternative.
