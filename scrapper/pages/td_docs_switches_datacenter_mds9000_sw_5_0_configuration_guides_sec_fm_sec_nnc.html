As of Cisco Fabric Manager Release 5.0(1a), software configuration information is available in new feature-specific configuration guides for the following information:
•System management
•Interfaces
•Fabric
•Quality of service
•Security
•IP services
•High availability and redundancy
The information in these new guides previously existed in the Cisco MDS 9000 Family CLI Configuration Guide and in the Cisco MDS 9000 Family Fabric Manager Configuration Guide. Those configuration guides remain available on Cisco.com and should be used for all software releases prior to Fabric Manager Release 5.0(1a). Each guide addresses the features introduced in or available in a particular release. Select and view the configuration guide that pertains to the software installed in your switch.
Some information from the Cisco MDS 9000 Family CLI Configuration Guide and the Cisco MDS 9000 Family Fabric Manager Configuration Guide now appears in the following guides that are common among products that run the \/ operating system:
•Cisco NX-OS Licensing Guide - Explains the licensing model and describes the feature licenses.
•Cisco NX-OS Fundamentals Guide - Describes the switch setup utility and includes general CLI, file system, and configuration information.
For a complete list of document titles, see the list of Related Documentation in the "Preface."
