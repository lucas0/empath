JSON support
Support for JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data format has been added for Generic Data Sources. More and more external data providers are moving to JSON format instead of XML format due primarily to the compactness of the format. This feature increases the flexibility of our generic data source integration to support upload of content with this format.
System data source type
This new data source type is introduced to add IP addresses to the Data Integration feature to support implementation of custom suite welcome messages.
Table Lookup support
The primary use case for this feature is to support creation of custom welcome messages.
This feature allows users to create multiple mapping tables, each having multiple key-value mappings. User can upload tables from a TSV file or can create tables and mappings from the UI. Once tables are created, you can use the Table Lookup options or a custom XPath function can be defined, to look up values from these tables for specified keys for output field mapping.
Widgets Tool Enhancements
Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.0 introduces the following Widgets tool enhancements:
Default canvas background color is changed from white to gray.
Default alignment for the List component is changed from horizontal to vertical.
Multiple fonts are supported.
Internationalization and Localization
Note Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.0 supports internationalization and localization for the Cisco DMP 4310G only and the Cisco Unified IP Phone 7975G and IP Phone 9971.
Internationalization (i18n)
Internationalization (known as i18n) support refers to the software infrastructure that is designed to accommodate multiple language translations (localization) without requiring additional engineering changes to that software.
The Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.0 software supports i18n for the following general areas of the solution:
Control Panel in Cisco StadiumVision Director
Dynamic Menu Board application
Management Dashboard in Cisco StadiumVision Director

Note Certain locales are not supported in Release 4.0, such as right-to-left languages.
Language Packs for Localization
Note Language packs are release-specific. You can install available language packs for Release 4.0.0-707, after you have installed or upgraded to Release 4.0, and when the 4.0 version of the language pack for the desired language is available.
Cisco StadiumVision Director provides increased flexibility to upload and install only the specific language(s) that you want to support through the independent installation of Language Packs. The upload and installation of the language packs is performed using the Software Manager from the Cisco StadiumVision Director main menu. For more information about how to install language packs, see the Cisco StadiumVision Director Software Installation and Upgrade Guide, Release 4.0.
Caution A Cisco StadiumVision Director system that is using language support from Release 3.2.0-520 (SP2), will lose that support when first upgraded to Release 4.0, until language packs for the new release are installed.
The supported languages in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.0.0-707 (SP2) are:
Deutsch (de_DE)
English (en_US). This is the default locale in all Cisco StadiumVision Director releases.
French (fr_FR)
Portuguese (pt_BR)
Russian (ru_RU)
Simplified Chinese (zh_CN)

Modify and/or cancel a single occurrence, recurring event series, or an occurrence within a recurring event series.
Automate the start and stop of an event script.
Define event script parameters when scheduling an event script.
View scheduled event scripts by day, week, and month.
For more information, see “How to Schedule Event Scripts and Series” in the Cisco StadiumVision Director Operations Guide.
Server Administration
The following changes have been made that affect administration and behavior of Cisco StadiumVision Director:
Backup File Retention
CMS Restart After Backup
TUI
Backup File Retention
The default backup file retention policy and methodology has changed in Release 4.0 from retention by number of days to number of backup file instances (Figure 2). The default is to retain one backup only in the system.
Caution Be sure to note that in Release 4.0, the backup retention policy has been changed from the policy in Release 3.2 to help you maximize storage for your content and to help manage space for your backup file to be stored. With only a single backup file being retained after you upgrade, the first time that you run a backup on your 4.0 system, you will only have a single 4.0 backup file available for restore. See the “Upgrade Process” section in the “Important Migration and Upgrade Notes” section for new recommendations to the upgrade process.
CMS Restart After Backup
In Release 4.0, the CMS is automatically restarted after a backup is run. Therefore, the CMSRestartTask is no longer needed and can be removed if configured in your system.
TUI
The Text Utility Interface (TUI) has been changed under StadiumVision Server Administration > Retention Policy for both Backup/restore Files (Figure 2) and Log Files (Figure 3) menus.
Figure 2 TUI Backup/restore Files Menu
  The TUI Log Files menu options have been renamed for easier understanding. The default retention period is 15 days.
Figure 3 TUI Log Files Menu
  SV-4K Hardware SPDIF Support
Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.0.0-525 introduces support for audio from the primary video routed to the Sony/Phillips Digital Interface (SPDIF) port.
For more information about the SV-4K media player hardware, see the Cisco StadiumVision SV-4K Media Player Deployment Guide.
Synchronized Content Playback Across SV-4K Devices
Note This feature is supported only on the SV-4K media player. It does not apply to the Cisco DMP 4310G.
The enhanced Synchronized Content Playback Across SV-4K Devices feature provides enhanced synchronized content rendering of playlist items on the displays. This includes transitioning from one item to the next (such as for still images), and more accurate playback and rendering of local video content. For local video, this serves as the foundation for implementing video ribbon boards and video walls.
Note Widgets, external URL and multicast video tuning synchronization are outside the scope of this feature.
Content playback synchronization relies on using the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) that provides enhanced synchronization accuracy. The PTP master, in turn, will get its time from an NTP server.
For more information about provisioning PTP for the SV-4K media player, see the Cisco StadiumVision SV-4K Media Player Deployment Guide.
User Interface Change Summary

Management Dashboard
Many updates have been made across the Management Dashboard in Cisco StadiumVision Director to support the new SV-4K media player provisioning, monitoring, and management. This section highlights some of these changes.
Auto-Registration Settings
New and re-qualified auto-registration settings have been added to distinguish the firmware fields for the SV-4K versus the DMP 4310G.
Global DMP Settings
A new section of provisioning settings for the SV-4K is introduced in the Management Dashboard toolbox under SV Director Configuration > System Configuration > Global DMP Settings > SV-4K Settings.
The properties under each of the Global DMP Settings sections have also been reorganized to differentiate settings for the Cisco DMP 4310G and the new SV-4K media player. The current sections include:
Common
4310 v5.x.x Settings
SV-4K Settings
Luma Key
Support for control over the transparency of the second video template region is available through a configurable luma key value in the Management Dashboard for the SV-4K media player..
To set the luma key globally in the Management Dashboard, go to SV Director Configuration > System Configuration > Global DMP Settings > SV-4K Settings > Luma key. The default value is #ff2000.
The luma key is enabled on a per-template basis from the Templates Screen in the Control Panel. For more information about using a luma key, see “How to Use Luma Keying for Dual Video Templates” in the Cisco StadiumVision Director Operations Guide.
Management Dashboard Commands
The SV-4K media player supports a subset of the Management Dashboard commands that are available for the Cisco DMP 410G and introduces several new ones.
DMP Commands
The following DMP commands are removed:
Disable SSH Access
Enable SSH Access
Some of the new DMP commands are:
Disable Diagnostic Web Server
Enable Diagnostic Web Server (For use with Cisco Technical Support)
Reset Storage
For more information about the Management Dashboard commands supported in Release 4.0 for the SV-4K device, see the “Management Dashboard Commands for the SV-4K Media Player” appendix of the Cisco StadiumVision SV-4K Media Player Deployment Guide.
TV Commands
The following TV Commands have been renamed:
Show Init Swf is now Show Diagnostics
Hide Init Swf is now Hide Diagnostics
Display Init swf message is now Show Diagnostics with Message
Model Filtering
A new “Model” filter has been implemented that allows you to select media players by type:
DMP 4310 or SV-4K (Figure 5).
Figure 5 Managment Dashboard Model Filter
.
Templates Screen
The following enhancements are introduced to the Templates screen in the Control Panel:
A new default template called “Full Screen Dual Video” is added.
The “Enable luma key” option is introduced for the SV-4K media player only, to support transparency for overlays per template. It applies only to the second video region.
Zones Screen—New Zone
The “Use as Video Wall” check box is added to the New Zone dialog box to enable programmatic content synchronization for a script that runs on SV-4K media players that are configured for the same zone.
This feature has increased benefit for video wall deployment because when an SV-4K device reboots, it catches up with the content that the rest of the devices in the video wall are displaying. The SV-4K devices use the same template in a script state, and use the same playlist in the same screen regions. Also, the playlists must be created so that the number of items and content durations are uniform.
For more information, see the “Working with Video Walls” section of the Cisco StadiumVision Director Operations Guide.

Important Upgrade Notes for Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.0.0-601 (SP1)
Caution An upgrade to Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.0.0-601 (SP1) is required to resolve “CSCuu22735—Flash player unable to load Control Panel due to Adobe certificate issue.” section. After you perform an upgrade to Release 4.0.0-601, you must be sure to also perform the following post-upgrade verification steps including:

1. Clear the browser cache.
2. Close all browser windows and wait for 10 seconds before restarting.

Failure to do so might prevent the required Adobe libraries and certificate from reloading for proper operation of Cisco StadiumVision Director.
Important Upgrade Notes From Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2 to Release 4.0
Caution Before you upgrade your system from Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2 to Release 4.0, run a basic System State Report (SSR), download the SSR, and store it externally from Cisco StadiumVision Director. Once you have upgraded both your primary and secondary servers to Release 4.0, they will be configured to retain a single backup file only. You will no longer have access to any 3.2 data after the first 4.0 backup is completed. If for some reason you must revert to Release 3.2, contact Cisco Technical Support and provide them with your SSR file to help you restore it.

To help avoid any need to fall back to Release 3.2, be sure to follow carefully all recommended best practices and post-upgrade tasks as documented in the Cisco StadiumVision Director Software Installation and Upgrade Guide, Release 4.0, including thoroughly testing your system to your site requirements before failing over and upgrading your backup server to Release 4.0.
Limitations and Restrictions
When using Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.0, be aware of the following limitations and restrictions:
Caution Proof of play raw data repository in /var/sv/pofp/raw directory is not part of the backup process. In normal operation, a completed script with a green dot already has a copy of the raw data and is part of the backup data. No further action is needed aside from generating the PoP report. For completed scripts that do not have a green dot, it is very important to investigate or call for support within 60 days of the event, after which time the PoP messages in the raw directory will be deleted.
If you have previously accessed a different Cisco StadiumVision Director version on your computer, sometimes unexpected behavior or warnings arise, or you might access an older version of the interface. In this case, and especially after an upgrade, you must clear your browser cache.
The first release of Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.0 implements the infrastructure only to support i18n and L10n to support the independent installation of other language packs with Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.0 as they become available.
Cisco StadiumVision Director does not support internationalization for back-end messaging.
Non-English characters are not supported as a Cisco StadiumVision Director login credential.
Multi-user support in Cisco StadiumVision Director is limited to script editing only. No other Control Panel functions for templates, zones, groups, and playlists support a multi-user environment, and these areas can be deleted by other users. However, users are notified about potential impact due to currently locked scripts and are prompted for confirmation of deletion and given an option to use instant messaging to coordinate with the script owner.
No more than 10 user sessions can be supported at any one time in the Management Dashboard and Control Panel areas. The system does not prevent more than 10 sessions to be opened, so you need to be careful that you do not exceed this limit.
No more than 50 staging threads can be processing in Cisco StadiumVision Director at any one time. The default maximum is 10. The maximum is configured using the “stagingThreadNum” registry found under the Tools > Advanced > Registry section of the Management Dashboard.
Note If auto-registration is enabled and a new DMP is detected, then Cisco StadiumVision Director initiates staging and always uses 50 as the maximum value. In this case, the stagingThreadNum registry setting is ignored and remains unchanged.
Important Notes
This section includes other important information about the Cisco StadiumVision solution that you should know for optimal operation. It includes the following topics:
Media Player Maintenance Recommendations
System Utilization Values
Media Player Maintenance Recommendations
To avoid unexpected behavior and maintain normal operation of your devices, it is highly recommended that you perform a soft reboot of all of the media players in your system:
Cisco DMP 4310G—Weekly.
SV-4K—Weekly.
You can reboot DMPs manually or configure a periodic task to run automatically. Remember that the automatic scheduled task applies to all media players in the system.
Note Before you perform a reboot, be sure that there are not any active scripts running.
For more information see the “ How to Configure the Reboot DMP System Task From the Management Dashboard ” task note.
System Utilization Values
Measurement units for storage in Cisco StadiumVision Director are based on a KB equivalent of 1024 bytes [known as a kibibyte)KiB)], not 1000 bytes.
Therefore, a notation of MB actually means 1,048,576 (1024 x 1024) bytes in Cisco StadiumVision Director.

CSCuu95550—SV4K: Custom font files with consecutive spaces in name doesn't work.
Symptom Custom font files with consecutive spaces in the file name will not work.
For example:
“this is a test.ttf” file name will work.
“this is a test.ttf” file name will not work.
Workaround Rename files that contain consecutive spaces in name to not contain any spaces or no consecutive spaces.
CSCuu90971— SV4K: At times, multicast fails to fill region if it has diverging aspect ratio.
Note This defect is fixed with SV-4K firmware version 5.1.68.1.
Symptom Video fails to fill the whole template video region (scale up) to fill the whole 4:3 aspect ratio. It seems to correct itself when the user goes into Help, System Info or Guide and quits that page. After that, the video fills the whole region as it is supposed to do.
Workaround Ensure that your video region has a matching aspect ratio to the multicast stream you are playing in that region.
CSCuu90769—SV4K: If primary and secondary video regions transition at the same time, the secondary video might not play.
Symptom Occasionally when both regions transition, the secondary region (with lumakeyed videos) will show the first frame but will not play. The playlist will continue to rotate normally and videos will continue to play normally.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. In a script state use a dual video region template.
2. In primary region, assign a playlist that rotates every 15 seconds.
3. In secondary region, assign a luma-keyed playlist every 15 seconds.
Note The duration does not have to be 15 seconds, but the duration for both playlists should be the same.
4. Run the state and look at multiple transitions.
Workaround Do not have the playlist rotations occur at the same time.
CSCuu81607— Multicast video is not displayed in video region.
Symptom While State-1 is playing and a change to State-2 occurs exactly when one local video in the playlist is coming to an end and the next one is about to start, the multicast video is not being displayed sometime in the video region of State-2 and blank/black screen is displayed. The issue occurs randomly.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Create a playlist (duration 15 seconds) of containing local videos of duration 15 seconds each.
2. Create Non Video type Playlist (duration 15 seconds) with L-Wrap static contents.
3. Create a template with a video region (X-237, width-1684, height-947) and another non-video region (width-1920, height-1080).
4. Create a Script with 3 states: A blank state, state-1 and state-2.
5. Assign zones containing multiple Cisco 4310 DMPs to the states.
6. For State-1 assign the playlist created in step 1.
7. For State-2 assign a multicast channel to the video region and L-Wrap playlist (created in step 2) to the other region..
8. Play the script.
9. While State-1 is playing try to change the state to State-2 exactly when one local video in the playlist is coming to an end and the next one is about to start. Change the state exactly when local video transition is happening.
Workaround Create a duplicate state of State-2 and change to the duplicate state from State-2 after 60 seconds. Or, use an intermediate full screen static state.

CSCuu22735—Flash player unable to load Control Panel due to Adobe certificate issue.
Symptom Sometime on 5/5/2015, the ability to load the Cisco StadiumVision Director Control Panel was reported from the field and also reproduced in the Cisco lab. The Control Panel will start to load but will remain at 0% on screen. Before 5/5/2015 there were no issues in loading Control Panel.
Possible Cause A certificate in the Adobe library expired without announcement to the development community causing applications that utilize the Adobe library to cease operating on or after 5/6/2015. Adobe has since provided updated versions of their libraries with updated certificates.
Recommended Action Follow the workaround steps listed below as we are currently in the process of building a service pack with these libraries to address this within the next two weeks (no later than 5/22/2015).
Workaround Please utilize Mozilla Firefox to access Cisco StadiumVision Director once you’ve completed the workaround steps below. You may have to complete the steps daily.
Complete the following steps to reset the Mozilla Firefox browser:

On a PC, clear the browser cache from Control Panel > Flash Player Settings Manager.
On a Mac, clear the browser cache from System Preference > Flash Player.
Step 2 Select the Storage tab, click Delete All.
Step 3 Click Confirm.
Step 4 Select the Advanced tab, under Browsing Data and Setting, click Delete All.
Step 5 Go to the following URL using a Firefox browser on your PC or Mac:
http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html
Step 6 Uncheck “Store common Flash components to reduce download times”.
Step 7 Click Confirm.
Step 8 Close all Firefox sessions and verify that all sessions are closed.
Step 9 Open a new Firefox session.
Step 10 Launch Cisco StadiumVision Director.
  Note This issue also exists in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.1 and 3.2.
CSCuu04450—SV-4K: Cycle other states with widget > 1K times runtime stops responding
Symptom SV-4K: Cycle other states with widget > 1K times runtime stops responding. The widget contains the following components:
1. 2 x GSIS Clock
2. 1 x Text2Screen
3. 1 x Pic2Screen
Using a script and triggers to cycle the widget state with other states every 15 seconds, the runtime becomes unresponsive after > 1000 state changes.
Workaround There is no workaround.
CSCuu03150—SV-4K: Widget disappears on screen if certain conditions are met
Symptom SV-4K: Widget disappears on screen if certain conditions are met.
Conditions If all of the following conditions are met, the widget will either appear for several seconds and then disappear from the screen or it won't appear at all.
1. The template used has at least 2 regions and the non-widget region is playing video (multicast or local videos).
2. On the widget canvas a component is close to or extends outside the left edge of the canvas.
3. On the widget canvas another component extends outside the right edge of the canvas.
If any of the conditions are not met, the issue won’t occur.
Workaround Try to avoid at least 1 of the conditions and the issue will not occur. For example:
1. For the non-widget region, use a non-video region instead.
or
2. Move the components further away from the edge of the canvas.
CSCuu01028—4310: State change before runtime loads DMP won’t go to correct state
Symptom DMP 4310: State change before runtime loads DMP won’t go to correct state.
Conditions If the state changes in SVD before the 4310 runtime finishes loading, it will continue to play the default multicast video stream and won’t go into the correct state. The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Create a script with a blank first state.
2. Create other states with actions.
3. Run the script.
4. When the 4310 runtime is restarting, go to a state with action.
Notice when the 4310 finishes loading the runtime it will stay streaming the default multicast stream and not go to the active state selected in SVD. This does not occur 100% of the time. There seems to be a window during the runtime start up that when the state changes causes this issue to occur.
Note This issue also exists in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2.
Workaround Wait until the 4310 runtime has completely started before changing states. If there is a timer on the first blank state (best practice) in the script ensure the wait time is long enough. The duration of the empty state should be at least two minutes (120 seconds) depending on how many media players are in the system and the amount of time it takes to stage content.
CSCuu01207—IP Phone service does not work due to wrong DB value
Symptom The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Add a new suite under the Suits tab. Enter a name under the Intro sub-tab and do not click Save.
2. Go to the Phone & Remote subtab, assign a device (IP Phone) and click the save button.
3. Refresh the Luxury Suite List on the left-hand side and click on the suite you created.
4. Click on the Phone & Remote sub-tab and look for the device (IP Phone) assigned before.
Expected Result:
The IP Phone should already be assigned and the checkbox should be selected. Services should be available in the newly assigned IP Phone.
Actual Result:
The IP phone is not assigned and the checkbox is not selected. In the database a row is created in sne_suitemap table with the value 0 for column luxurySuiteId. The IP Phone service is not accessible and error message is displayed on IP Phone.
Recovery/Impact:
Once the above steps are performed (for example, once a row in sne_suitemap table is created with the value 0 for column luxurySuiteId for an IP Phone) the Service is not accessible from that IP Phone unless you delete the row from sne_suitemap table and then you can assign the IP phone to the suite again.
The issue is reproducible and once it occurred, there is no way to recover without deleting the row from DB.
Note This issue also exists in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2.
Workaround When creating a new Luxury Suite, click the Save button before assigning a Controller to the Suite.
CSCut92271—In the Widget Designer, changing databinding name will revert back to old one
Symptom In the Widget Designer, changing the databinding name will revert back to old one. This appears to only be a display issue, the databinding is actually changed.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Start from SVD main page, click Control Panel > Widgets tab.
2. Open a widget that has a component which is databinded to a data source.
3. Select the databinded component and click on the Data Binding tab on the bottom.
4. Pick another active Data Source and Data Field.
Notice the data binding has changed successfully.
5. Click on the canvas to deselect the component.
6. Select the component again.
Notice the Data Source and Data Field names have changed back to the old names. The actual databinding continues to be the new one which is the correct behavior.
Workaround Reload the Control Panel UI.
CSCut92240—Content doesn’t display for copied Widget containing data pull component
Symptom Content doesn’t display for the copied Widget that contains the data pull component.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Create a widget with a few text areas.
2. Bind the text areas with data fields of 3 or more data sources.
3. Add a few data pull components and bind them to each of the datasourses, then save the widget.
4. Create a playlist with the created widget.
5. Create a script, add a DMP, assign the playlist, and then run the script.
Contents from the datasource are displayed in the TV screen.
6. Stop the script.
7. Copy the created widget, rename it (optional).
8. Edit the playlist created earlier, then remove the previous widget and add the copied widget to the playlist.
9. Run the Script again.
Contents from datasources are not displayed.
Workaround
1. Remove all the data pull components from the copied widget, then save the widget.
2. Add data pull components again and bind them to appropriate data sources.
3. Save the widget.
CSCut85688—In FCS release the LLDP setting can become “yes” instead of “true”
Symptom In FCS release, the LLDP setting can become “yes” instead of “true”. The correct setting for “LLDP enabled” should be “true” or “false”. However, in the FCS release (build 230) the UI drop-down in the Dashboard has values “yes” and “no”.
The default database value from a fresh ISO install is “true” but if a user uses the drop-down in the Dashboard then clicks the save button, the value will change to either “yes” and “no” which is incorrect. The result is both “yes” and “no” will result in LLDP being disabled. This can cause various issues such as:
1. SV-4K DMP unable to negotiate 30 watts of power from the switch port resulting in an unexpected restart of the port PoE when the DMP draws too much power.
2. The Auto Link feature in SVD will not work since it depends on LLDP information from the switch port.
3. LLDP information will not be available to be displayed in SVD and the DMP.
Workaround In FCS2 release (build 402) if this value is “yes” then change it to “true” through the drop-down. Then reboot the DMPs.
CSCut52094—Widget using > 1 txt2scr component alternating colors not working
Symptom Widget using >1 txt2scr component alternating colors are not working. When there is more than 1 text2screen components in a widget, the alternating color feature does not work correctly. Only the first color will be used. When there is only 1 text2screen component, the alternating color features work correctly.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Create a Widget with only 1 Text2screen component.
2. Bind it to a data source.
3. Notice the data is alternating between the 2 colors chosen.
4. Add another text2screen component.
Notice the colors no longer alternate for both the first component that was working and the second component which is new.
Note This issue also exists in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2.
Workaround There is no workaround.

Symptom User gets a black screen after quitting SSC video album.
Conditions User is playing a video album and then quits it. The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Log into SVD.
2. Create a new suite.
3. Create a new SSC user.
4. Using new SSC user, log into the SSC album management module.
5. Create a new video album and publish it.
6. Using the IP Phone or the local control API start the new video album.
7. Play videos on the album.
8. Quit album.
Note This issue also exists in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2.
Workaround User does a channel up/down, then the 4310Gs will get back to multicast.
CSCut36513—SV-4K: DMP sluggish after high number of state changes (>1000).
Symptom SV-4K: DMP sluggish after high number of state changes (>1000). DMP starts exhibiting sluggish behavior after a high number of state changes. Test performed changed state every 15 seconds for over 5 hours.
Workaround Restarting runtime seems to fix the issue.
CSCut31933—Display Spec un-mute command has to be called “UnMute” (capitalization)
Symptom Display Spec un-mute command has to be called “UnMute” (notice capitalization). Sometimes in the UI this command can be called “Unmute” (note the capitalization). If the command is not exactly “UnMute” it will not work.
Workaround Change the command to or add a new command called “UnMute”.
CSCut19866—SV-4K: Show Diag. w/ msg the msg string truncated after first space.
Symptom SV-4K: Show Diag. w/ msg the msg string truncated after first space. When using the “Show Diagnostic with Message” Dashboard command the message string is truncated after the first space.

For example, the string “This is a test.” will be displayed as “This”. However “This-is-a-test.” will be displayed correctly since there is no space in the string.
Workaround Workaround is to use “%20” in place of a space in the string. For example “This%20is%20a%20test.”.
CSCut19833—SV-4K: If SVD not available for config files load runtime will be stuck.
Symptom SV-4K: If SVD is not available for config files load runtime will be stuck. When the DMP runtime is trying to load the channels/dmpconfig files if SVD is not available the runtime gets stuck at the start up screen. Even if SVD subsequently becomes available the runtime will not continue.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Stop httpd on the SVD server.
2. Restart the runtime on a DMP.
3. Notice when it is requesting the channels config file it fails and it gets stuck. Preferred behavior is to have a retry mechanism.
Workaround Workaround is to restart the runtime from Dashboard.
CSCut13072—4310G: Ch chg (IR/Phone) on static img in mixed pl/region video show behind.
Symptom 4310G Ch. change (IR/Phone) during static image playlist video show behind.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Create a playlist containing only static images typed video/mixed media playlist.
2. Create a new script where you assigned your newly created playlist to a template’s video region.
3. Using the IR controller, attempt to make a channel change (either up or down).
On the 4310Gs, the screen will continue to display the non-video playlist content and it will display multicast channel behind the static playlist.
Note This issue also exists in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2.
Workaround There is no workaround.
CSCut13034—Ch. banner wont display on IP phone sel. w/ static img non-vid pl/region.
Symptom When you do a selection on one or ALL DMPs on a given suite, the customary channel banner will not show on both 4310Gs and SV-4Ks alike.
Workaround There is no workaround.
CSCut11864—Msg displayed when a script is scheduled redundantly is not translated.
Symptom Msg displayed when a script is scheduled redundantly is not translated.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Upgrade the non-English language packs and apply the settings accordingly for one of them.
2. Login to SVD application.
3. Navigate to Scheduler.
4. Ensure that an event is scheduled at 9PM for a day.
5. Try to schedule another event for the same time.
6. The warning message is still displayed in English.
Observed Result:
The warning message displayed when a script is scheduled at the same time as one of the earlier scripts is still displayed in English.
Workaround There is no workaround.
CSCut11850—SVD Scheduler Logo, SysTime are not translated for Non-Eng Lang packs.
Symptom SVD Scheduler Logo, SysTime are not translated for Non-Eng Language packs.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Upgrade the non-English language packs and apply the settings accordingly for one of them.
2. Login to SVD application.
3. Navigate to Scheduler.
4. View the Cisco Stadium vision Director Scheduler Logo and System time.
Workaround There is no workaround.
CSCut08937—Scheduler: Date-time format should be set as per the client locale.
Symptom The scheduler date-time format is not set as per the client locale.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Log in to the SVD server (4.0 - 170).
2. Click on the Scheduler and it opens up to the month view.
3. Bring up the create event window by double clicking on any date.
4. Observe the time period - time format. The date and time format should be displayed as per the client locale. Currently we are showing the label below the time period.
Workaround There is no workaround.
CSCut07374—Scheduler: Same script can be scheduled for multiple concurrent events
Symptom Scheduler should block creating multiple events with the same scripts for the same time interval at all times. Currently scheduler allows the user to create multiple events for the same script for the same time interval in some special cases.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Open the Scheduler and click on the current date.
2. Create a recurring weekly future event.
3. On the Choose the days which is past for the current week.
4. Select a time and create the event.
5. Go to step one and repeat the same steps.
Expected Result:
Scheduler should block creating multiple events with same script for the same time.
Actual Result:
Scheduler allows the user to schedule multiple events with the same script for the same interval.
Workaround User to create a weekly event.
CSCut07046—Unable to create weekly events from current date in some special cases.
Symptom Scheduler does not allow to create events for a future date if user tries to create it from the current date, and if the time selected for the future event is past for the current day.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Open the Scheduler and click on any date.
2. Go to the ‘current date’ and double-click on the date to bring up the “Create Event” window.
3. Select a future date and select a time which is past for the current date.
4. Try to save the event.
Expected Result:
Event should be saved for the future date for any time given by the user (it should allow the user to select any time of the day for a future event).
Actual Result:
It blocks the user to create a future event for a time that is ‘past’ for the current date.
Workaround This only happens when user tries to create a future event from the ‘current date’. If user tries to create the event from any future date, this issue will not be there. User can select any time of the day for the event from a future date.
CSCut05896—Scheduler UI: extra event name is displayed for weekly events.
Symptom Scheduler UI: Extra ‘event name is displayed without color code’ for weekly events - this extra event is not created in the Control Panel - Control Panel list of scheduled events shows the scheduled events correctly.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Open the Scheduler and click on any date.
2. Create recurring weekly event using the ‘after’ option (eg: 5 instances).
3. Check if the events are showing correctly on the scheduler page for the scheduled days.
Expected Result:
Scheduler UI should not display any extra events on the following day.
Actual Result:
Scheduler displays the extra event name on the following day.
Note Event though this occurrence is created on the scheduler side, this occurrence is not listed in the CP, so the event runs correctly for the scheduled days.
Workaround User can click on this extra created event on the scheduler UI and delete it to avoid any confusion.
CSCut02474—Video content with large I-frames can cause macro-blocking on SV-4K.
Symptom Video content with large I-frames can cause macroblocking during playback on the SV-4K DMP. Here is the definition according to about.com - "macroblocking is a video artifact in which objects or areas of a video image appear to be made up of small squares, rather than proper detail and smooth edges. The blocks may appear throughout the image, or just in portions of the image."
Workaround Make use of CBR video only and adhere closely to content creation guidelines to mitigate the issue. However, if you are using the Adobe Creative Cloud video encoding tool, use the following special settings to work around a problem with non-standard H.264 support (the most important setting is the key frame distance):
Render settings:
VBR, 1 pass
Target: 10 Mbps
Max: 12 Mbps
Key Frame Distance: 9
CSCus99824—”Flash Problem” DMPs continually resets to zero and increments upwards.
Symptom “Flash Problem” DMPs continually resets to zero and increments upwards. Customer is expecting 194 DMPs to be in a “critical” status due to them being powered off. However there is a different category, “flash problem,” which denotes whether a valid UID (epoch time stamp value) was received by the flash template when it was polled. (An unexpected or ‘null’ value will cause the “flash problem” error even if the DMP itself is online.) It kind of jumps all over the place, reporting 0-13 and then slowly climbing back up to 194 of its own accord. If we leave it alone for an extended period of time we will eventually end up with 194 DMPs having a “flash problem.” We can't cleanly tie a “get status” request in and of itself with the “flash problem” category resetting to zero. Even after 5-6 minutes from the “get status” the numbers are the same.
To summarize, the complaint is that the “flash problem” category resets to zero, and then increments upwards during the course of a scan. This issue is potentially misleading if they look at the dashboard during this process. It would seem like desirable behavior is to cache the last result (from a finalized scan) and replace it with a new result after this process has completed.
Note This issue also exists in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.2.
Workaround There is no workaround.
CSCus94801—Scheduler - Unable to convert a recurring event to a single event.
Symptom Unable to convert a recurring event to a single event in the Scheduler application.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Log in to the SVD server.
2. Click on the Scheduler and it opens up to the month view.
3. Create a recurring event for few days (eg: event for 10 days).
4. Change this ‘recurring event’ to ‘single event’ by unchecking the option “Recurring Event”.
Expected Result:
This recurring event should be changed to single event.
Actual Result:
A warning message is displayed as “Same script has been scheduled for same date and time.”
Workaround Workaround is to delete the recurring event and create a single event with the same script and same time.
CSCus86181—Excel imports into table lookup feature can lead to quotes on values.
Symptom Excel imports into table lookup feature can lead to quotes on values. The use of commas (,) and quotation marks (“) on the string values on the confection of a table import will lead to double quotation marks on the saved Excel TSV file. Therefore, upon importing said file, both keys and their values can endup with quotation.
Workaround Avoid using commas and double quotes in the strings to be imported using the table lookup feature.
CSCus84150—Sometimes Dashboard DMP status doesn't update until being clicked on.
Symptom Sometimes Dashboard DMP status doesn't update until being clicked on.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Sometimes on a server a DMP status in Dashboard will show out of compliance for a DMP.
2. If the user clicks on the line then the status changes to compliant.
3. Perform a GetStatus, the DMP continues to be in compliance.
4. Close and reload the Dashboard.
5. Notice the DMP is out of compliance again until user clicks on it.
Workaround Perform a GetStatus.
CSCus78159—Users are allowed to create Display specs w/out specifying Make/Model #.
Symptom Users are allowed to create Display specs w/out specifying Make/Model #. When creating new display specs, both Make and Model row has an asterisk next to it indicating they are required fields. However customers are allowed to save the Display Spec by just filling in either Make or Model. They don’t need to specify both. If Model row is not specified for a Display Spec, then Zones & Groups > Locations tab > under Display Spec there will be no value next to the DMP.
Workaround User should fill in Make/Model # when creating a Display Spec.
CSCus74087—Sometimes return from ad-hoc state channel no change region will repaint.
Symptom Sometimes return from ad-hoc state channel no change region will repaint.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Create a normal state with dual video. Primary video region can either be multicast video or local video. Secondary video region will be luma video.
2. Create a ad-hoc state that changes the luma video but use “channel no change” for primary video region.
3. Run the normal state, go to ad-hoc state, then come back to normal state.
4. Notice sometimes the entire screen will repaint which is not the desired behavior.
Workaround There is no workaround.
CSCus72042—SV-4K: If runtime is restarted during its startup process crash can occur.
Symptom SV-4K: If runtime is restarted during its startup process crash can occur:
1. Starting/Stopping a script in rapid succession.
or
2. Send restart runtime commands from Dashboard in rapid succession.
There is a small window during the runtime startup process that if another restart is received the runtime could crash and the DMP will reboot after several minutes of blank screen. However the chance of occurrence is small.
Workaround Workaround is to wait until the runtime has fully started before starting/stopping a script or send a restart runtime command from Dashboard.
CSCur89659—SV-4K: Turning on PTP on DMP for first time requires an extra reboot.
Symptom For a SV-4K DMP turning on PTP on DMP for first time requires an extra reboot.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. In Dashboard configure the PTP domain and PTP Master Candidates fields.
2. Reboot the DMPs.
3. When they all finished starting up look at “http://x.x.x.x/ptp.html”. Notice even though it shows PTP to be on it doesn’t show any PTP information which means PTP isn’t correctly running.
4. Reboot all the DMPs.
5. Load the “ptp.html” page again. Notice the page now shows all the DMPs which is the correct behavior.
Workaround Reboot an extra time.
CSCur88531—SV-4K: If bootup with no HDMI plugged in resolution defaults to 640x480.
Symptom SV-4K: If bootup with no HDMI plugged in resolution defaults to 640x480. After HDMI is plugged in a reboot is needed to change the resolution.
Workaround Once HDMI is plugged in reboot the DMP to use the correct resolution.
CSCur84476 —SV-4K: Single item looping in playlist does not sync across DMPs.
Symptom Notice over time the sync between the DMPs will drift.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Create a playlist and place a single item in it.
2. “Change both the “Default item Duration” and the item duration to “0.”
3. Put the playlist in a state and run the script state across 2 or more DMPs.
Workaround Duplicate the item in the playlist and change the per-item duration back to the length of the item from “0.” Now that there are 2 items in the playlist it will give the runtime a chance to sync when the items transition from one to the other.
CSCur81524—SV-4K: First script state non-video, m-cast channel shows for a second or so.
Symptom SV-4K: When starting a script where the first state is a non-video state, multicast channel shows up for a second or so after script loads.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Log into Cisco StadiumVision Director.
2. Open the Control Panel.
3. Create a new non-video playlist with some images.
4. Create a new script, make sure that the first state uses a non-video state.
5. Save script.
6. Navigate to control and start script.
The runtime loading splash screen shows up. After that screen goes away, the user expects that the first script state will play. Instead, the user gets whatever multicast was playing before the script was started to run for a second or so.
Workaround As a best practice the first state in a script should be a “blank” state to allow all DMPs time to get into steady state before switching to a normal state. The duration of the empty state should be at least two minutes (120 seconds) depending on how many media players are in the system and the amount of time it takes to stage content.
