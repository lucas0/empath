Information about product support
The Cisco Billing and Measurements Server (BAMS) collects, formats, and stores billing and measurements data from the Cisco PGW 2200, also known as the Cisco Media Gateway Controller (previously the Cisco VSC3000 or Cisco SC2200). Cisco BAMS-formatted data can then be processed by a billing system and other measurement collection and reporting systems.
