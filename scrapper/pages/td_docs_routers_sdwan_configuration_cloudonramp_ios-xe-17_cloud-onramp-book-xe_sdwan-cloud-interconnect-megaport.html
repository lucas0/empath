Prerequisites for Cisco SD-WAN Cloud Interconnect with Megaport
Create Megaport account.
As part of the ordering process on Cisco Commerce workspace, you receive an email from Megaport about creating your account. Refer to the email for more information.
For a connection that requires a public peering between an Interconnect Gateway and a Cloud provider, specify a public BGP ASN and a public BGP peering IP address. Ensure that your organization is permitted to use the public BGP ASN and the public BGP peering IP address before you create the connection.
Ensure you have UUIDs for the required number of Cisco Catalyst 8000v instances that you wish to deploy as Interconnect Gateways.
Ensure that Cisco vManage can connect to the Internet.
As part of the configuration workflows, Cisco vManage connects to the Megaport portal via the Internet.
From Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1, ensure that you have the necessary Interconnect Gateway, Interconnect Connection, and supplemental licenses before you create Interconnect Gateways or Interconnect Connections. For more information, see License Management for Cisco SD-WAN Cloud Interconnect with Megaport.
Restrictions for for Cisco SD-WAN Cloud Interconnect with Megaport
General Restrictions
At each location, at a time, you can perform only a single interconnect operation such as deploying an Interconnect Gateway, or creating or deleting a connection at a time.
All interconnect and cloud operations are time bound. If an operation times out, Cisco vManage reports a failure. Currently, the time out values are not configurable.
If you modify the Global Settings, the changes are applied to any new gateways or connections created after the modification. The changes do not affect gateways or connections created before the modification.
Cloud Service Provider allocations apply to all Interconnect cloud connections created from Cisco vManage.
From Cisco vManage Release 20.9.2 and Cisco vManage Release 20.10.1, for a transit-hosted connection, in an AWS region, you can associate only one transit gateway with a Direct Connect gateway.
While Cisco vManage enforces this restriction from Cisco vManage Release 20.9.2 and Cisco vManage Release 20.10.1, we recommend that you associate only one transit gateway with a Direct Connect gateway in an AWS region with Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1 and earlier releases.
Starting from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10.1a, Cisco SD-WAN Cloud Interconnect with Megaport is supported only on versions Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a and later.
Interconnects to AWS
While creating a connection to an AWS cloud resource, adhere to the AWS quotas and limitations. Cisco vManage does not enforce all the AWS quotas and limitations.
You cannot use cloud resources belonging to different AWS accounts as part of a single connection.
Attach either private VIFs or transit VIFs to a Direct Connect gateway. You cannot attach a combination of private VIFs and transit VIFs to the same Direct Connect gateway.
From Cisco vManage Release 20.9.2, for a transit-hosted connection, in an AWS region, you can associate only one transit gateway with a Direct Connect gateway.
While Cisco vManage enforces this restriction from Cisco vManage Release 20.9.2, we recommend that you associate only one transit gateway with a Direct Connect gateway in an AWS region with Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1 and earlier releases.
All connections to a particular VPC must
peer with the same Direct Connect gateway
have the same transit gateway or virtual private gateway attachment
For a transit VIF, the transit gateway and Direct Connect gateway must use different BGP ASNs.
With Cisco vManage Release 20.5.x, you cannot edit a connection after its creation.
From Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, you can modify the bandwidth of hosted VIF connections created earlier. However, you cannot modify the bandwidth of hosted connections after they have been created.
While creating host VPC tags, choose to use the tag with either the AWS Multi Cloud workflow or the Interconnect Connectivity workflow. This choice cannot be altered after the tag is created and persists till the deletion of the tag.
Cisco vManage Release 20.9.x and earlier: A host VPC tag selected for Interconnect Connectivity cannot be edited while the tag is in use.
From Cisco vManage Release 20.10.1: A host VPC tag selected for Interconnect Connectivity can be edited while the tag is in use to add or remove host VPCs.
Cisco vManage Release 20.9.x and earlier: If a host VPC is associated with a tag and the tag is used in configuring an Interconnect Connection, the host VPC cannot be dissociated from the tag and associated with another tag.
From Cisco vManage Release 20.10.1: If a host VPC is associated with a tag and the tag is used in configuring an Interconnect Connection, you can dissociate the host VPC from the tag if one or both of the following conditions are met:
Additional host VPCs are associated with the tag
Additional VPC tags are used in configuring the Interconnect Connection
After a host VPC is dissociated from a tag, it can be associated with another tag.
If a VPC tag is used in configuring an Interconnect Connection, you can associate more host VPCs with the tag provided that these host VPCs belong to the same regions as the host VPCs already associated with the tag.
While creating a Direct Connect Private Hosted VIF, a Direct Connect Private Hosted Connection, or a Direct Connect Transit Hosted Connection to an AWS Direct Connect Gateway from an Interconnect Gateway, you can specify a custom IP address for BGP peering or let Cisco vManage pick an IP address from an internally reserved pool.
In Cisco vManage Release 20.5.x, the IP address is picked from the subnet 192.168.0.0/16. From Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, the IP address is picked from the subnet 198.18.0.0/16. Before upgrading Cisco vManage from release 20.5.x to 20.6.1 or later, check if any connection to AWS is configured to use a custom BGP peering IP address from the subnet 198.18.0.0/16, which is internally reserved from Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1. If so, delete the connection and re-create the connection with a custom IP address that does not overlap with 198.18.0.0/16.
When editing interconnect transit connection, if a new transit gateway is selected without a VPC tag in the same region, connection edit is discarded.
Interconnects to Microsoft Azure
While creating host VNet tags, choose to use the tag with either the Microsoft Azure Multi Cloud workflow or the Interconnect Connectivity workflow. This choice cannot be altered after the tag is created and persists till the deletion of the tag.
Cisco vManage Release 20.9.x and earlier: A host VNet tag selected for Interconnect Connectivity cannot be edited after creation.
From Cisco vManage Release 20.10.1: A host VNet tag selected for Interconnect Connectivity can be edited while the tag is in use to add or remove host VNets.
Cisco vManage Release 20.9.x and earlier: If a host VNet is associated with a tag and the tag is used in configuring an Interconnect Connection, the host VNet cannot be dissociated from the tag in use and associated with another tag.
From Cisco vManage Release 20.10.1: If a host VNet is associated with a tag and and the tag is used in configuring an Interconnect Connection, the host VNet can be dissociated from the tag if one or both of the following conditions are met:
Additional host VNets are associated with the tag
Additional VNet tags are used with the Interconnect Connection
After a host VNet is dissociated from a tag, it can be associated with another tag.
If a VNet tag is used in configuring an Interconnect Connection, you can associate more host VNets with the tag provided that these host VNets belong to the same regions as the host VNets already associated with the tag.
While creating a private-peering connection to a Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute from an Interconnect Gateway, you can attach to the connection only the VNets, virtual WANs, and virtual hubs that belong to the same resource group as the ExpressRoute circuit. Attaching VNets, virtual WANs, and virtual hubs from a different resource group is not a supported configuration.

Interconnects to AWS
When you delete a connection to AWS, Cisco vManage deletes the VIF, the virtual private gateway, and the route table that were created while establishing the connection.
When you delete a connection, Cisco vManage removes any attachments and associations to a Direct Connect gateway, transit gateway, or virtual private gateway that were created while establishing the connection.
While creating a connection to AWS, if you created a Direct Connect gateway or transit gateway from Cisco vManage, deleting the connection does not delete the gateway. Manage these AWS resources as required.
When you create a connection, a new route table is created and set as the Main route table for the host VPCs attached to the connection.
In Cisco vManage Release 20.5.1, a default route to the virtual private gateway or transit gateway is created in the Main route table and route propagation is enabled. Edit the routes and propagation as required.
From Cisco vManage Release 20.5.1, the static routes and subnet associations required to be accessed by the interconnect should be moved to the newly created Main route table by Cisco vManage.
From Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, a default route is created in the Main route table to only the transit gateway, and route propagation is enabled. Edit the routes and propagation as required.
If you modify the Global Settings, the changes are applied to any new gateways or connections created after the modification. The changes do not affect gateways or connections created before the modification.
Interconnects to Google Cloud
For nonredundant connectivity, you must deploy a Google Cloud Router in each network-region and create a VLAN attachment for each Google Cloud Router. In the Megaport fabric, an interconnect is created from the Interconnect Gateway to each Google Cloud Router.
For redundant connectivity, you must deploy two Google Cloud Routers in each network-region and create a VLAN attachment for each Google Cloud Router. In the Megaport fabric, an interconnect is created from each of a pair of Interconnect Gateways to each Google Cloud Router.
For use with interconnect attachments, you must set the Google ASN for the Google Cloud Routers to 16550.
Interconnects to Microsoft Azure
Only one pair of Interconnect Gateways can connect to a particular ExpressRoute to provide a HA connection to the VNet attched to the ExpressRoute.
To connect a second pair of Interconnect Gateways to the same vNet, do as follows: create another ExpressRoute; attach the vNet to the ExpressRoute; and connect the Interconnect Gateways to the ExpressRoute
You can have a maximum four such ExpressRoutes connecting to a VNet, and connect each Express Route to a pair of Interconnect Gateways.
An ExpressRoute can connect to maximum of 10 VNets. You can attach VNets to an ExpressRoute while creating connections to the ExpressRoute from Interconnect Gateways. VNets are attached based on the VNet tags you choose for the connection.
If you choose a VNet tag that applies to more than 10 VNets or choose a combination of VNet tags so that the total number of select VNets is more than 10, interconnect creation fails.

Note
Any VNets that you may have attached to the ExpressRoute from the Azure portal are also considered while determining the number VNets that you can attach to the ExpressRoute while creating the connection from the interconnect gateways.
You can connect a VNet to either a VNet gateway or an ExpressRoute gateway. So, if you have created a private peering to a VNet through a VNet gateway, you cannot create a private peering to the same VNet through an ExpressRoute gateway, and vice-versa.
If a VNet is connected to virtual hub in a virtual WAN, the same VNet cannot be connected to another virtual WAN.
Each region of a virtual WAN must have only one virtual hub.
All the VNets in a region must connect to a single virtual hub in the same region.
Redundant connectivity is the default and only supported configuration. You must create connections to Microsoft Azure from a pair of Interconnect Gateways in the Megaport fabric.
When choosing a pair of Interconnect Gateways from which you wish to create the primary and secondary connections to a Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute, ensure that the Interconnect Gateways are configured to use the same BGP ASN for BGP peering.
Information About Cisco SD-WAN Cloud Interconnect with Megaport
You can deploy a Cisco Catalyst 8000v Edge Software (Cisco Catalyst 8000V) instance in the fabric of the SDCI provider Megaport. Further, you can link a branch location to the Cisco Catalyst 8000v instance using the Cisco SD-WAN fabric. We recommend that you deploy the Cisco Catalyst 8000v instance at a Megaport location closest to your branch location.
The Cisco Catalyst 8000v instance acts as an edge device in the SD-WAN fabric and as the Interconnect Gateway in the Megaport fabric. From the Interconnect Gateway, you can create a direct Layer 2 connection (an interconnect) in the Megaport fabric to a cloud onramp or another Interconnect Gateway. The interconnects link branch locations, or link branch locations to cloud service providers through the Megaport fabric.

Note
In the Megaport terminology, the interconnect gateway is also referred to as the Megaport Virtual Edge (MVE). The direct Layer 2 connection from an interconnect gateway to a Cloud OnRamp or another interconnect gateway is called a Virtual Cross Connect (VXC).
In this setup, Cisco SD-WAN fabric acts as the overlay network, and the Megaport fabric acts as the underlay network. The Megaport fabric provides data-center-agnostic, efficient, high-speed, low-latency, high-bandwidth connectivity across data centers in 700 global locations.
You can create the following types of connections from an Interconnect Gateway:

AUDIT_INFO
Benefits of Audit
Audit helps in identifying the gaps or disconnects between Cisco vManage intent and what has been realized in the cloud. The gaps are in terms of cloud resources, connectivity and states. When such gaps are detected, Cisco vManage flags such gaps and helps you take corrective action.

Scenario Resolution
Unable to add Interconnect Account
Verify that the account credentials associated with Cisco vManage are correct.
If you updated the credentials with Interconnect Provider, update the account credentials on Cisco vManage.
While attempting to create an Interconnect Gateway, the device list is empty Verify that the devices has been assigned a template. (Recommended template: Default_MEGAPORT_ICGW_C8000V_Template_V01)
While attempting to create an Interconnect Gateway, cannot find the desired location Click the Refresh button to update the list of available locations.
Creation of Interconnect Gateway failed
Check the configuration task progress on Cisco vManage for any error messages.
If you are using the Interconnect Global Settings, check whether the selected software image is available at the Interconnect Provider location.
If the VM instance is not deployed or the IP pool is exhausted, check with the Interconnect provider.
While creating a Direct Connect connection, the Direct Connect gateway or the transit gateway list is empty
On the AWS portal, verify that the desired Direct Connect gateway or transit gateway is available.
Click the Refresh button to fetch the list of gateways from AWS.
If a gateway is not available in AWS, create the gateway through Cisco vManage.
While creating a Direct Connect connection, host VPC tags are not listed Verify that the host VPC tags are available and enabled for Interconnect Connectivity.
Creation of Direct Connect connection failed
Check the configuration task progress on Cisco vManage for any error messages.
If you are using the Interconnect Global Settings, check whether the internal IP address pool has been exhausted. If yes, delete some connections and retry.
If you are using custom settings, ensure that you haven’t entered overlapping CIDR subnets for peering.
Check whether you have reached any connection limits. See Usage Notes for Cisco SD-WAN Cloud Interconnect with Megaport.
Verify permissions of the Interconnect Provider account and the AWS account.
Traffic flow issues
Ensure that the required security rules for inbound and outbound traffic are configured for the host VPC.
Verify whether the virtual interface has been created and attached to the Direct Connect gateway.
In AWS, verify whether the BGP peering status is in the UP state for the virtual interface.
Verify whether the correct route table is being used as the main routing table for the host VPC and whether the necessary routes are being propagated towards the virtual private gateway or the transit gateway.
Verify whether the virtual private gateway or transit gateway is attached to the Direct Connect gateway.
Latency issues
Verify whether the Interconnect Gateway location is in close proximity to the Direct Connect location chosen while creating the connection.
Ensure that you have configured the appropriate bandwidth for the connection.
Cloud Gateways are not displayed in the drop-down list
Ensure that the necessary Cloud Gateways are created using the Multicloud workflow and the minimum requirements listed in this document are met.
Traffic to VPC or VNET workload is sent over the internet even after creating an Interconnect Connection to the Cloud Gateway
When an SD-WAN branch is connected to a Cloud Gateway through the internet and through an Interconnect Connection from an Interconnect Gateway to access the same VPC or VNET workload, by default, traffic from the branch is sent through the internet.
To make the private path through the Interconnect Gateway the preferred path, apply appropriate control and data policies to the WAN edge device at the branch, the Interconnect Gateway, and the Cloud Gateway.
