Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco vManage CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
On very congested and large networks, the default hold time may not be sufficient for all routers and access servers to receive hello packets from neighbors. In this case, increase the hold time duration. The hold time should be at least three times the hello interval. If a router does not receive a hello packet within the specified hold time, services through this router are considered unavailable. Increasing the hold time will delay route convergence across the network.
For usage guidelines, see the Cisco IOS XE hold-time command.

Device(config)# router eigrp virtual-name
Device(config-router)# address-family ipv4 vrf 1 autonomous-system 4453

Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Release 17.2.1v Command qualified for use in Cisco vManage CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
By default, routes from other routing protocols are not redistributed into EIGRP. It can be useful for EIGRP to learn OMP routes, because OMP learns routes to destinations throughout the overlay network. This command can be used to redistribute omp routes into EIGRP.

Device(config)# router eigrp INSTANCE1
Device(config-router)# address-family ipv4 unicast vrf 1 autonomous-system 100
