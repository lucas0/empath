    Cisco CrossworkOptimization Engine provides real-time network optimization capabilities that allow operators to effectively maximize network utility as well as increase service velocity using real-time traffic engineering and proactive optimization.
Network operators are facing challenges to support the exponential growth of network traffic while addressing the pressure to efficiently run network operations. Providing quick service and network resolutions is vital for the business to remain viable. Network operators need a toolset to help automate bandwidth optimization and steer traffic efficiently with minimal operator intervention.
Figure 1.            
Figure of network development lifecycle with related actions for each phase
In a typical network development lifecycle, there is always a feedback loop that is traditionally done manually through human intervention. With network automation, the objective is to automate the feedback loop to enable quicker reaction to network events and faster determination on actions to perform on the network, while preserving operator intent in the network.
Looking at the network operation lifecycle above, Crosswork Optimization Engine is built to fulfill the need for a closed-loop optimization cycle as described under “Near Real-Time Feedback Loop.” Through Crosswork Optimization Engine, the operator would be able to define the optimization intent, implement the intent, and continuously monitor, track, and react to maintain the original intent.

Real-time, multivendor visibility
End-to-end visibility is important to any network operator to run their network effectively. Crosswork Optimization Engine provides not only this visibility, but also the ability to visualize the network across different layers (L2 adjacencies and L3 IP topology) and the relationship between each layer.
Crosswork Optimization Engine leverages IETF-standard BGP-LS protocol to discover IP networks automatically, with features such as:
●      Up-to-date visibility: Maintains real-time, up-to-date visibility of the network infrastructure, which provides the network operator with true representation of the actual topology.
●      Hierarchical view: Provides a hierarchical view of the topology, which enables operators to define the different levels of granularity in the topology visualization.
●      Visualization of both SR-MPLS and SRv6 networks.

Simplified workflow for SR -TE policy and RSVP-TE tunnel lifecycle management
Crosswork Optimization Engine also provides an easy-to-use UI to manage the SR-TE policy and RSVP-TE tunnel lifecycle. The UI enables the network operator to:
1.     Create, modify, and remove SR-TE policies or RSVP-TE tunnels using an intuitive workflow.
2.     Continuously track SR-TE policies and RSVP-TE tunnels dynamic path computations to maintain SLA objectives.
3.     Preview an SRTE policy or RSVP-TE tunnel before deploying it to the network.

Bandwidth management feature packs:
The Crosswork Optimization Engine feature packs allow users to augment their traffic engineering operations and include bandwidth use cases or preserve bandwidth as an intent in the network. With Crosswork Optimization Engine 3.0, the following bandwidth management capabilities with feature packs are offered:
1.     Bandwidth on Demand:
As the name suggests, Bandwidth on Demand allows an operator/user to provision a Segment Routing Traffic Engineering (SR-TE)–based policy with a requested bandwidth between a specific set of devices. It is a soft bandwidth guarantee and can include a secondary optimization objective such as latency/TE/IGP.
2.     Local Congestion Mitigation:
Local Congestion Mitigation resolves congestion issues at the local interface level. This is done by rerouting traffic via tactical SR-TE policies only between devices on either side of the congested link. This way, the mitigation is localized to the congested interface and the end-to-end policy is not rerouted. This feature allows for operators to regain some control of the network by introducing a human in the loop. Upon congestion detection, mitigation recommendations are provided to the user and applied to the network only upon user confirmation. It can also be used as a monitoring tool to understand long-term congestion and failure patterns in the network, which will enable operators to augment capacity or perform maintenance in the identified parts of the network.
3.     SR Circuit Style Manager
Segment Routing Circuit-Style (SR Circuit-Style) is a new way to provide a predictable way to transport circuit-like services (Optical circuits, TDM) over a Segment Routing network. To do so, SR Circuit-Style provides a bandwidth management mechanism that will guarantee that a given service will get the necessary bandwidth along its path (and along its backup path). The Segment Routing policy itself is supposed to follow some strict rules when provisioned: explicit path only, co-routed, bi-directional (guaranteed latency), Bandwidth guaranteed, Fault protected and Diversity.

There are two options for COE 5.0 installation – via vCenter and on a CSP device. Please see rows 1 and 2 for system requirements for both options.
Table 3.        Crosswork Optimization Engine 5.0 System Requirements
System Resource Type
Requirement Details
Hypervisor and vCenter
●  VMware vSphere 6.7 or later.
●  VMware vCenter Server 7.0 and ESXi 7.0.
●  VMware vCenter Server 6.7 (Update 3g or later) and ESXi 6.7 (Update 1).
Installation should be done from the Crosswork Installer
CSP DC requirements*
●  Cisco CSP, Release 2.8.0.276
Allowed hardware list:
●  UCSC-C220-M4S, UCSC-C240-M4SX
●  N1K-1110-X, N1K-1110-S
●  CSP-2100, CSP-2100-UCSD, CSP-2100-X1, CSP-2100-X2 CSP-5200, CSP-5216, CSP-5228
●  CSP-5400, CSP-5436, CSP-5444, CSP-5456
CPU/memory/storage profiles (per VM)
The data center host platform has to accommodate 3 VMs of the following minimum configuration. It is preferrable that the VMs are hosted on separate physical servers for diversity:
vCenter:
●  12 vCPUs | 96 GB RAM Memory | 1 TB disk space
CSP:
●  12 CPU cores | 96 GB RAM Memory | 1 TB disk space
Note: The install allows VM Memory and CPU sizes to be adjusted, and re-adjusted post installation.
Storage requirements vary based on factors such as the number of devices being supported and the type of deployment selected. Due to their performance, solid state drives (SSD) are preferred over traditional hard disk drives (HDD). If you are using HDD, the minimum speed should be over 15,000 RPM.
The VM data store(s) need to have disk access latency of <10 ms or >5000 IOPS. SSD or high-performance disks are recommended.
●  By default, enforcing a “hard” reservation for the VM’s resources, the requirement will be 12vCPUs, 100% memory (i.e., 96 Gb for Large) and a revised 18 GHz reservation per VM, up from the previous default of 24 Gb and 16 GHz.
Additional SSD Storage
50 GB (approximately) of storage is required for the Crosswork OVA (in vCenter), OR the Crosswork QCOW2 image on each CSP node (in CSP).
Network connections
For production deployments, we recommend that you use dual interfaces, one for the Management network and one for the Data network.
When the VMs are deployed on separate physical hosts, the network connectivity between the hosts needs to be a minimum of 10 Gbps.
IP addresses
●  2 IP subnets for the Management and Data network with each allowing a minimum of 4 assignable IP addresses (IPv4 or IPv6). Each Crosswork VM requires an IP address from the Management and Data subnets, respectively. In addition, the installation as a whole requires one Virtual IP (VIP) address from the Management and Data subnets, respectively. The total number of IP addresses on each subnet is 4, making for a total of 8 IP addresses across the two subnets.
●  Note: When deploying a IPv6 cluster, the installer needs to run on an IPv6-enabled container/VM.
●  Note: At this time, your IP allocation is permanent and cannot be changed without redeployment. For more information, contact your Cisco Customer Experience team.
●  Dual-stack configuration is not supported in Crosswork Platform Infrastructure. Therefore, all addresses for the environment must be either IPv4 or IPv6. Do not attempt to configure both in a single interface.
Upgrade requirements
Upgrade of a Crosswork cluster of ‘N’ UCS or CSP nodes will require ‘N+1’ UCS or CSP nodes for the OVA upgrade. For example, in a cluster of 3 ‘nodes,’ an additional node will be needed for the upgrade, bringing the total to 4 ‘nodes’ or UCS/CSPs.
The additional node is just temporary for the duration of the upgrade to facilitate the upgrade. Post upgrade, a cluster of N nodes will continue with the same number of nodes/resources.
*Please contact your local account team or Customer Experience team before deploying the CSP option.
