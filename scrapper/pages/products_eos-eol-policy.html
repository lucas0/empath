End-of-Life Policy
Purpose
All products reach the end of their life cycle for several reasons, including market demands, technology innovation and development-driven changes, or product maturity and replacement with functionally richer technology. Even so, Cisco also recognizes that end-of-life (EOL) milestones often prompt companies to review the impact to the Cisco products, services, or subscriptions in their networks. With that in mind, we have set out below Cisco's End of Life milestones to help manage EOL transitions and to explain the role that Cisco can play in helping to migrate to alternative Cisco technology.
Scope
Cisco’s End of Life Policy (“Policy”) applies to all Cisco hardware, software, cloud services and service offers (collectively “Products”) that have their own unique product part number or product identifier (“PID”). Versions or releases of a Product that do not have a unique PID are not subject to this Policy.
This Policy covers all new EOL notifications made in all theaters on or after September 29th 2022. It does not apply to a Cisco Product that is already subject to an EOL notification as of September 29th 2022.
Policy
End of Life Milestones:
External notification of end of sale is typically six (6) months before the End of Sale (“EOS”) date, which is the date after which you can no longer purchase the relevant Cisco Product. Such notice will appear on cisco.com at http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-listing.html. Please visit this site regularly as it contains useful information regarding Cisco's end-of-life program. Sign up to receive notifications at the Cisco Notification Service.
No subscriptions (including renewals) with a term extending beyond Last Day of Support (“LDOS”) will be sold after the EOL Notification Date.
The Last customer ship date for hardware is three (3) months after the hardware EOS date.
Cisco will provide the following to customers with active support contracts or subscriptions (including cloud services):
One (1) year of routine failure analysis for hardware from the EOS date.
One (1) year of bug fixes, maintenance releases, workarounds or patches for critical bugs from the EOS date, when reported to TAC. After the first year, Cisco will provide bug fixes, workarounds and/or patches, where available, for (i) two (2) years for OS software, and (ii) one (1) year for application software. Customers may be required to install a newer software version to receive the above software support.
Three (3) years of TAC support for OS software from the software EOS date, except for the final release of the OS software running on EOS hardware as noted below.
Two (2) years of TAC support for application software from the EOS date.
TAC support from the EOS date until the end of the term for subscription software and cloud services.
Five (5) years of TAC support for hardware from the EOS date. TAC support for the final release of OS software running on the EOS hardware will be coterminous with the hardware LDOS, regardless of the OS software EOS date.
Five (5) years of replacement parts for hardware from the EOS date, in accordance with Cisco’s Return Materials Authorization (RMA) process.
Customers may:
Add a new support contract to hardware (including OS software) and application software for up to one (1) year from the EOS date, provided the contract end date does not exceed LDOS.
Renew support contracts for hardware (including, OS software) and application software, provided the contract end date does not exceed LDOS.
Renew or add on to an existing software subscription or cloud service on or after the EOS date, provided the new subscription end date does not exceed the last date the subscription or cloud service is available as determined by Cisco.
EOL Milestone Table
Definitions
For purposes of this policy, the following definitions apply:
End of Life (EOL) A process that guides the final business operations associated with the Cisco Product life cycle. The end-of-life process consists of a series of technical and business milestones and activities that, once completed, make a Product obsolete. Once obsolete, the Product is not sold, improved, maintained, or supported.
End of Sale date (EOS) The Product is no longer offered for sale after this date. This is also the last date to order the Product through Cisco point-of-sale mechanisms. The EOS date is documented in the EOL notification.
EOL Notification Date The date on which the end of sale and the end-of-life milestones for a Product is communicated to the public.
Last Date of Support (LDOS) The last date to receive support as entitled by active service contracts for covered Cisco hardware and software. After this date, support is no longer available.
