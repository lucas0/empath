Network Diagram
The configuration that is described in this document uses this network topology:
Workflow for FirePOWER Services on UCS-E
Here is the workflow for FirePOWER services that run on a UCS-E:
The data-plane pushes traffic for inspection out from the BDI/UCS-E interface (works for G2 and G3 Series devices).
The Cisco IOS®-XE CLI activates packet redirection for analysis (options for all interfaces or per-interface).
The sensor CLI setup startup script simplifies the configuration.
Configure CIMC
This section describes how to configure the CIMC.
Connect to CIMC
There are multiple ways to connect to the CIMC. In this example, the connection to the CIMC is completed via a dedicated management port. Ensure that you connect the M port (dedicated) to the network with the use of an Ethernet cable. Once connected, run the hw-module subslot command from the router prompt:
ISR-4451#hw-module subslot 2/0 session imc

IMC ACK: UCSE session successful for IMC
Establishing session connect to subslot 2/0
To exit, type ^a^q

Interfaces
On the Dual-Wide UCS-E, there are four interfaces:
The highest MAC address interface is Gi3 on the front panel
The second highest MAC address interface is Gi2 on the front panel
The last two that appear are the internal interfaces
On the Single-Wide UCS-E, there are three interfaces:
The highest MAC address interface is Gi2 on the front panel
The last two that appear are the internal interfaces
Both of the UCS-E interfaces on the ISR4K are trunk ports.
The UCS-E 120S and 140S have three Network Adaptor plus Management Ports:
The vmnic0 is mapped to UCSEx/0/0 on the router backplane
The vmnic1 is mapped to UCSEx/0/1 on the router backplane
The vmnic2 is mapped to the UCS-E front plane GE2 interface
The front-panel management (M) port can only be used for the CIMC.
The UCS-E 140D, 160D, and 180D have four Network Adaptors:
The vmnic0 is mapped to UCSEx/0/0 on the router backplane.
The vmnic1 is mapped to UCSEx/0/1 on the router backplane.
The vmnic2 is mapped to the UCS-E front plane GE2 interface.
The vminc3 is mapped to the UCS-E front plane GE3 interface.
The front-panel management (M) port can only be used for the CIMC.
vSwitch Interfaces on ESXi
The vSwitch0 on the ESXi is the management interface through which the ESXi, FireSIGHT Management Center, and the FirePOWER NGIPSv device communicate to the network. Click Properties for the vSwitch1 (SF-Inside) and the vSwitch2 (SF-Outside) in order to make any changes.
This image shows the properties of the vSwitch1 (you must complete the same steps for the vSwitch2):
