Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCvy17030 FMC Connection Events page "Error: Unable to process this query. Please contact support."
Problem Description
The Firepower Management Center (FMC) MonetDB event database might crash and fail to show connection events.
Background
The FMC MonetDB database stores logs of various connection events. The database might crash, which results in loss of access to connection event data for some versions of Firepower software that run MonetDB Version 11.37.12.
Problem Symptom
Connection event processing is unavailable and "Error: Unable to process this query. Please contact support." is displayed in the user interface.
Error messages contained in the "merovingian.log" log file on the FMC indicate that a file cannot be opened because it does not exist. The name of the missing file is frequently either "01/166" or "01/167".
