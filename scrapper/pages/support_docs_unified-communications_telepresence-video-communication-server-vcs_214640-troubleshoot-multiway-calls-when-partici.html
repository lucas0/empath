Introduction
This document describes how to troubleshoot the problem when Cisco Telepresence Video Communication Server (VCS) participants on a Multiway call fail to merge a Cisco Unified Call Manager (CUCM) endpoint.

Components Used
This document is not restricted to specific software and hardware versions.
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Problem

When 2 participants are on a point to point call on the VCS and then, they dial out to an endpoint on the CUCM and press merge , the merge fails.
Solution

When you collect the logs from CUCM, you see that the VCS sends out a REFER to the CUCM. Basically the VCS asks the endpoint on the CUCM to dial into the multiway URI .
The CUCM usually sends a 404 Not Found for this REFER .

This is because the Rerouting Calling Search Space on the CUCM does not have the partition to reach the SIP route pattern that points to the SIP trunk to VCS.

The Inbound Calls Calling Search Space (CSS) or Out-of-Dialog Refer CSS has nothing to do with this call scenario, it is the Rerouting Calling Search Space on the SIP trunk that must be able to reach the SIP route pattern in order to reach the VCS.
