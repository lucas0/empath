Introduction
This document describes a few queries about the HSEC license for the autonomous and SDWAN modes.
Is a reload required on ISR4K/ISR1K/8300/8200 platforms for 'license feature hsec' to take effect?
No, a reload is not needed with CLI 'license feature hsec'. CLI is applicable only in the autonomous mode. In SDWAN, reload is required followed by the hsec installation either online or offline.

Is it true that on 8500-based platforms, a reload is required for hsec to get activated?
Yes, the 8500 platform family requires a reload in either autonomous or controller mode.

Is a reload needed for C8000v post activation of hsec?
No, it is not needed. The license stays as 'not-in-use' as per the design on C8kv, but the device gets unlimited throughput immediately after the hsec install.
Do you need to reload for CSR1000v post activation of hsec?
No, post activation of hsec, the CSR1000v does not require a reload.
Is the reload behavior the same for SDWAN and non-SDWAN modes?
No, the SDWAN and non-SDWAN modes with respect to the hsec enablement are quite different.
In the SDWAN mode, a reload is required to enable/activate hsec, while in the non-SDWAN mode, the CLI 'license feature hsec' enables/activates hsec on the device. A reload is not needed on CSR1000v and C8kv platforms in the SDWAN mode.
Is it also true for the deactivation of hsec license?
The hsec license can be uninstalled in the non-SDWAN mode, however, the hsec license cannot be uninstalled while the feature is in use. The user is required to disable/deactivate hsec license with CLI 'no license feature hsec' and reload the device for the license to be in the 'not-in-use' state and then initiate the uninstall command. The hsec license 'uninstall' in the SDWAN mode is not supported as the feature cannot be disabled. However, the user has an option to go to the autonomous mode and uninstall as a workaround upon known challenges with the mode changes.
