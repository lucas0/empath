Migrating the Cisco Nexus 1000V VSMs
This document describes how to migrate the Cisco Nexus 1000V VSMs in high-availability (HA) pair from Cisco Nexus 1010 Virtual Services Appliance (Cisco Nexus 1010 VSA) or Cisco Nexus 1100 Cloud Services Platform (Cisco Nexus 1100 CSP) to Cisco Cloud Services Platform 5000 (Cisco CSP 5000) while keeping one VSM active at all times.
Prerequisites
Following are the prerequisites for migrating the Cisco Nexus 1000V VSMs while keeping one VSM active:
Cisco Nexus 1010 VSA or Cisco Nexus 1100 CSP must have Release 4.2(1)SP1(4) or later.
Layer 2 connectivity must exist between the Cisco Nexus 1010 VSA or Cisco Nexus 1100 CSP and the Cisco CSP 5000.
Layer 2 or Layer 3 connectivity (depending upon the SVS connection mode) must exist between the Cisco CSP 5000 and the VEMs.
Migrating the Primary VSM
Exporting the Primary VSM
Before you begin
Log in to the Cisco Nexus 1010 VSA or Cisco Nexus 1110 CSP CLI in EXEC mode.
Make sure all prerequisites specified in Prerequisites are met.
Procedure
Step 1
Shut down the primary VSM.
Example:
n1110-x# config t
n1110-x(config)# virtual-service-blade VSM-test
n1110-x(config-vsb-config)# shutdown primary 
Step 2
Export the primary VSM to an image file.
Example:
n1110-x# export primary
Note: export started..
Note: 
 Export operation may take upto 100 minutes. Please be patient..
Note: please be patient..
Note: export completed...
Step 3
Identify the image file location and name.
Example:
n1110-x# dir bootflash:export-import
4096    Jan 25 20:50:12 2016  5/

Usage for bootflash://sup-local
 2266730496 bytes used
 1724649472 bytes free
 3991379968 bytes total
n1110-x# dir bootflash:export-import/5/ 
190632137    Jan 25 20:50:30 2016  Vdisk5.img.tar.00
Step 4
Copy the image file to an FTP or SFTP server.
Example:
n1110-x# copy bootflash:export-import/5/Vdisk5.img.tar.00 
ftp://admin@10.10.10.1/share/SV-REPO/Vdisk5.img.tar.00

Enter vrf (If no input, current vrf 'default' is considered): 
Password: 
***** Transfer of file Completed Successfully *****    
Copy complete, now saving to disk (please wait)...
Step 5
Make a copy of the VSM configuration. You can use this file as a reference when creating vNICs on Cisco CSP 5000.
Example:
n1110-x# show running-config
  virtual-service-blade vsm-test
  virtual-service-blade-type name VSM_SV3-1.6
  interface control vlan 119
  interface control uplink PortChannel1
  interface management vlan 119
  interface management uplink PortChannel1
  interface packet vlan 119
  interface packet uplink PortChannel1
  ramsize 4096
  disksize 3
  numcpu 2
  cookie 744636134
  shutdown primary
  no shutdown secondary
Step 6
From the CLI of the active VSM, clear the MAC address of the peer supervisor.
Example:
n1000v# peer-sup mac-addresses clear
Importing the Primary VSM
This section describes how to import the primary VSM image file to Cisco CSP 5000 by using the web interface. You can also use the Cisco CSP 2100 commands and REST APIs to import the primary VSM.
To import the primary VSM through web interface, do the following:
Procedure
Step 1
Log in to the Cisco CSP web interface.
Step 2
Click the Configuration tab and then click the Repository tab .
Step 3
On the Repository Files page, click Select.
Step 4
Select the primary VSM image file exported in the previous section (Vdisk5.img.tar.00), click Open, and then click Upload.
After the VSM image is uploaded, the image name and other relevant information are displayed in the Repository Files table.
Step 5
Click the Configuration tab and then click the Services tab.
Step 6
On the Services page, click Create to create a new service for the primary VSM.
Step 7
Enter a name for the service in the Enter Service Name field and press Enter.
Step 8
Click Target Host Name and choose a target host for the primary VSM from the available hosts.
Step 9
Click Image Name and choose the imported image (Vdisk5.img.tar.00) from the list.
Step 10
Click vNIC, create three vNICs for each interface of the VSM, and do the following for each vNIC:
Click VLAN and enter the same VLAN ID that was used in the primary VSM configuration.
Click Model and choose e1000.
Click Network Name and specify the name of the uplink.
Tip 
For the values of these fields, you can refer to the copy of the primary VSM configuration saved in Step 5 of Exporting the Primary VSM.
No change is required in the VLAN Type, VLAN Tagged, and Native VLAN fields.
Step 11
Click Resource Config and do the following:
Click Number of Cores and enter the same value that was used in the primary VSM configuration.
Click RAM (MB) and enter the same value that was used in the primary VSM configuration.
Tip 
For the values of these fields, you can refer to the copy of the primary VSM configuration saved in Step 5 of Exporting the Primary VSM.
No change is required in the Disk Space (GB) field.
Step 12
(Optional) Click VNC Password and enter a complex alphanumeric password in the Enter VNC Password field and the Repeat Password field to secure your remote access.
Step 13
Leave the Storage Config, Crypto Bandwidth, and Serial Port fields as they are. No change is required in these fields.
Step 14
Click Deploy.
The primary VSM service is deployed and it is automatically powered on.
Verifying High Availability After Importing the Primary VSM
A few minutes after the primary VSM on Cisco CSP 5000 is powered on, the console of the secondary VSM displays messages of the system entering the HA mode as shown in the following example. If these messages are not displayed, verify the layer 2 connectivity between the vnic1 interface on both primary and secondary VSMs.

Migrating the Secondary VSM
Exporting the Secondary VSM
After verifying that the primary VSM is stable, export the secondary VSM.
Before you begin
Log in to the Cisco Nexus 1010 VSA or Cisco Nexus 1110 CSP CLI in EXEC mode.
Make sure all prerequisites specified in Prerequisites are met.
Procedure
Step 1
Shut down the secondary VSM.
Example:
n1110-x# config t
n1110-x(config)# virtual-service-blade VSM-test
n1110-x(config-vsb-config)# shutdown secondary 
Step 2
Delete the existing export files from the bootflash: export-import directory.
Example:
n1110-x(config-vsb-config)# delete bootflash:export-import/5/
 This is a directory.  Do you want to continue (yes/no)?  [y] y
Step 3
Export the secondary VSM to an image file.
Example:
n1110-x# export secondary
Note: export started..
Note: 
 Export operation may take upto 100 minutes. Please be patient..
Note: please be patient..
Note: export completed...
Step 4
Identify the image file location and name.
Example:
n1110-x# dir bootflash:export-import
4096    Jan 25 20:50:12 2016  5/

Usage for bootflash://sup-local
 2266730496 bytes used
 1724649472 bytes free
 3991379968 bytes total
n1110-x# dir bootflash:export-import/5/ 
190632137    Jan 25 20:50:30 2016  Vdisk5.img.tar.00
Step 5
Rename the image file from Vdisk5.img.tar.00 to Vdisk5b.img.tar.00.
Step 6
Copy the image file to an FTP or SFTP server.
Example:
n1110-x# copy bootflash:export-import/5/Vdisk5b.img.tar.00 
ftp://admin@10.10.10.1/share/SV-REPO/Vdisk5b.img.tar.00

Enter vrf (If no input, current vrf 'default' is considered): 
Password: 
***** Transfer of file Completed Successfully *****    
Copy complete, now saving to disk (please wait)...
Step 7
Make a copy of the VSM configuration. You can use this file as a reference when creating vNICs on Cisco CSP 5000.
Example:
n1110-x# show running-config
  virtual-service-blade vsm-test
  virtual-service-blade-type name VSM_SV3-1.6
  interface control vlan 119
  interface control uplink PortChannel1
  interface management vlan 119
  interface management uplink PortChannel1
  interface packet vlan 119
  interface packet uplink PortChannel1
  ramsize 4096
  disksize 3
  numcpu 2
  cookie 744636134
  shutdown primary
  shutdown secondary
Step 8
From the CLI of the active VSM, clear the MAC address of the peer supervisor.
Example:
n1000v# peer-sup mac-addresses clear
