    Overview
The Secure Campus is a place in the network (PIN), a cluster of buildings, where a company does business. This guide addresses campus business flows across all industries and the security used to defend them. Campus examples are company headquarters, or any group of buildings that requires network services. More complex than branches due to physical and logical scale, they support network access for employees, third parties, and customers across multiple buildings and floors.
The Secure Campus is one of the six places in the network within SAFE. SAFE is a holistic approach in which Secure PINs model the physical infrastructure and Secure Domains represent the operational aspects of a network.
The Secure Campus architecture guide provides:
●      Business flows typical for campus locations
●      Campus threats and security capabilities
●      Business flow security architecture
●      Design examples and a parts list
  Figure 1.           The Key to SAFE. SAFE provides the Key to simplify cybersecurity into Secure Places in the Network (PINs) for infrastructure and Secure Domains for operational guidance.
SAFE simplifies security by starting with business flows, then addressing their respective threats with corresponding security capabilities, architectures, and designs. SAFE provides guidance that is holistic and understandable.

Business Flows
The Secure Campus is where physical presence is important for internal employees, third-party partners, and customers over multiple physical buildings.
●      Internally, employees use devices (PCs, laptops, phones, tablets, and other tools) that require access to campus-critical applications, collaboration services like (voice, video, email) and the Internet.
●      Third parties, such as service providers and partners, require remote access to applications and devices.
●      Customers at the campus use guest Internet access on their phones or tablets.
Figure 3.           Campus business use cases are color coded to define where they flow.
  Functional Controls
Functional controls are common security considerations that are derived from the technical aspects of the business flows.
Functional Controls
Description
Secure Applications
Applications require sufficient security controls for protection.
Secure Access
Employees, third parties, customers, and devices securely accessing the network.
Secure Remote Access
Secure remote access for employees and third-party partners that are external to the company network.
Secure Communications
Email, voice, and video communications connect to potential threats outside of company control and must be secured.
Secure Web Access
Web access controls enforce usage policy and help prevent network infection.
  Figure 4.           Campus business flows map to functional controls based on the types of risk they present.
  Capability Groups
Campus security is simplified using foundational, access and business capability groups.
Each flow requires access and foundational groups. Additional business activity risks require appropriate controls as shown in figure 5 which often reside outside the branch (non-campus capabilities).
For more information regarding capability groups, refer to the SAFE overview guide.
Figure 5.           Campus security simplified into capability groups
Secure Campus threats and capabilities are defined in the following sections.
Threats
Campuses have many employees, partner and guest users who use email, browse the web, collaborate. With a combination of wired and wireless access, the attack surface extends beyond the building.
The campus has six primary threats:
Phishing
Phishing is social engineering to trick people into clicking on a malicious link or opening an infected attachment of an email.
Messages looks as if they are from a legitimate organization, usually a financial institution, but contains a link to a fake website that replicates the real one
Unauthorized network access
The act of gaining access to a network, system, application or other resource without permission. The attacker could cause damage in many ways, perhaps by accessing sensitive files from a host, by planting a virus, or by hindering network performance by flooding your network with illegitimate packets.
Malware propagation
Devices present in the campus are a big source of contamination. Devices of employees, partners or customers can be infected from multiple sources such as web use, email use, or lateral infection from other devices on the network. Devices accepting credit cards and the Internet of Things are common attack points.
Web-based exploits
Malvertizing and compromised sites hosting exploit kits to take over employee devices using browser vulnerabilities.
BYOD - Larger attack surface
Mobile devices can roam networks increasing chances of compromise, and the spread of infection. The large variety of mobile devices makes security policies and posture checking almost impossible when no device standardization exists. Limited on-device security capabilities (e.g., firewall, anti-malware, browser sand-boxing).
Botnet infestation
Botnets are networks made up of remote-controlled computers, or “bots.” These computers have been infected with an advanced form of malware which allows the devices to be remotely controlled. The controller of a botnet is able to direct the activities of these compromised computers to perform other attacks, steal data, or send spam.
Security Capabilities
The attack surface of the campus is defined by the business flow, which includes the people and the technology present. The security capabilities that are needed to respond to the threats are mapped in Figure 6. The campus security capabilities are listed in table 1. The placement of these capabilities are discussed in the architecture section.
Figure 6.           Secure Campus Attack Surface and Security Capabilities

Architecture
SAFE underscores the challenges of securing the business. It enhances traditional network diagrams to include a security-centric view of the company’s business. The Secure Campus architectures are logical groupings of security and network capabilities that support campus business use cases. It follows a classic access/distribution/core architecture, scaling as needed by increasing distribution blocks  as floors or buildings are added.
SAFE business flow security architecture depicts a security focus. Traditional design diagrams that depict cabling, redundancy, interface addressing, and specificity are depicted in SAFE design diagrams. Note that a SAFE logical architecture can have many different physical designs.
Figure 7.           SAFE Model. The SAFE Model simplifies complexity across a business by using Places in the Network (PINs) that it must secure.
Secure Campus
The Secure Campus architecture has the following characteristics:
●      Location size consists of multiple buildings/floors that may have multiple business flows
●      Many varied devices requiring network connectivity
●      Devices (sensors, thermostats, printers, etc.)
●      Separate appliances for services for redundancy and maximum uptime
●      Wireless connectivity
●      Local application services (also in data center or cloud)
Figure 8.           Secure Campus. The Secure Campus business flows and security capabilities are arranged into a logical architecture. The colored business use cases flow through the green architecture icons with the required blue security capabilities.
Attack Surface
The Secure Campus attack surface consists of Humans, Devices, Network, and Applications. The sections below discuss the security capability that defends the threats associated with that part of the surface. Note that the capability might be a service that is supplied from another PIN. For example, the Identity service is prompted to a human, on a user’s device, enforced at the switch, andserved from the Data Center. However, for the sake of simplifying, Identity is depicted logically where the risk exists of supplying credentials: the human.
Human
Typically, humans in the campus are employees, partners, or customers. No amount of technology can prevent successful attacks if the humans in the company, both internal and partner users, are not trained to keep security in mind. One of the biggest problems is that humans are prone to compromise by various types of social exploits such as phishing.
Security training and metrics of adoption are critical elements to reducing the risk of this attack surface.
Administrators have more authority than normal users and the systems they have access to. Additional controls should be used like two-factor authentication, limited access to job function, and logging of their changes.
It is not the purpose of this guide to advise on the specifics. Appropriate identity services defined by policy must be supplied with associated, approved clients and devices.
Figure 9.           Business Use Cases
Devices
Malware propagation, Botnet infestation and a large attack surface are campus threats targeting devices. Perimeter defenses are no longer (if ever) sufficient.
Devices are part of the security reference architecture. A secure company uses the network and the devices connecting to it as baselines for comparison. If you are not using the network as a sensor, you are not secure. This visibility allows for effective containment through intelligent architectural design. It is equally important to ensure that clients (PCs, tablets, phones, and other devices) are participating in security and that malicious devices are quarantined.
Figure 10.        Campus Devices
Access Layer
Unauthorized network access is the primary threat addressable by the access layer.
The access/distribution/core is classic network hierarchy. The access layer is where users and devices connect to the company network. This layer connects to the distribution or core layer. Its hierarchical organization simplifies network troubleshooting and segments traffic for security. It is the first line of defense within the Secure Campus architecture. The network as a sensor utilizes flow analytics to capture anomalies and provide visibility to attacks.
Its purpose is to identify the users, to assess compliance to policy of devices seeking access to the network, and to respond appropriately. Violations of posture, identity, or anomalous behavior can be enforced.
  Figure 11.        Access Layer
Distribution Layer
Distribution layers segregate the access layer from the services layer. These layers provide a distribution method of services that discretely separates business-based traffic into flows, and allows scale as employees are moved, added, or changed.
Figure 12.        Distribution Layer
Core Layer
The core layer provides scale to the distribution blocks and connects them to the foundational security capabilities in the services layer.
Figure 13.        Core Layer
Services Layer
Web-based exploits are threat vectors that large campus populations need protection from.
The services layer connects the Secure Campus to the data center via service providers. It connects the access and distribution layers inside the campus to the security and inspection capabilities that secure the separate business flows coming into and out of the campus. Depending on the size of the campus, some security controls are brought into the campus as appliances rather than being served centrally as a service. See the Appendix for proposed options.

Summary
Today’s companies are threatened by increasingly sophisticated attacks. Campuses are commonly targeted because they are susceptible to physical access and have a large mix of services across increasingly complicated devices.
Cisco’s Secure Campus architecture and solutions defend the business against corresponding threats.
SAFE is Cisco’s security reference architecture that simplifies the security challenges of today and prepares for  the threats of tomorrow.
Appendix
Appendix A - A Proposed Design
The Secure Campus has been deployed in Cisco’s laboratories. Portions of the design have been validated and documentation is available on Cisco Design Zone.
Figure 15 depicts the specific products that were selected within Cisco’s laboratories. It is important to note that the Secure Campus architecture can produce many designs based on performance, redundancy, scale, and other factors. The architecture provides the required logical orientation of security capabilities that must be considered when selecting products to ensure that the documented business flows, threats, and requirements are met.
