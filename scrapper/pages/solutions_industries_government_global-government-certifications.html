Certifying products to meet global requirements
Cisco believes in the value of, and is committed to, the government product certification process. We deliver the right products with the right certifications to meet and exceed Public Sector customer expectations. The government certification business is complex. Therefore, Cisco has a dedicated resource team for overall program management of global government certifications and is our 3rd pillar of excellence in support of building trustworthy products.
Governments worldwide need to ensure that products they use meet their criteria, perform as expected, and work with their existing technology. As a leader in providing certified and evaluated products to the global marketplace, Cisco responds to these needs by maintaining an active product certification and evaluation program for global government customers.
