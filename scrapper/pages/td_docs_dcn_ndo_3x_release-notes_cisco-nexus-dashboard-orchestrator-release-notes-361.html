This document describes the features, issues, and deployment guidelines for Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator software.
Cisco Multi-Site is an architecture that allows you to interconnect separate Cisco APIC, Cloud APIC, and DCNM domains (fabrics) each representing a different region. This helps ensure multitenant Layer 2 and Layer 3 network connectivity across sites and extends the policy domain end-to-end across the entire system.
Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator is the intersite policy manager. It provides single-pane management that enables you to monitor the health of all the interconnected sites. It also allows you to centrally define the intersite configurations and policies that can then be pushed to the different Cisco APIC, Cloud APIC, or DCNM fabrics, which in term deploy them in those fabrics. This provides a high degree of control over when and where to deploy the configurations.
