About Cloud Service Endpoint Groups

Note
The following content refers to "Multi-Site Orchestrator" which has been rebranded to Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator. Same information is applicable to both products.
A cloud service EPG is a managed object that is a named logical entity that contains a collection of cloud native or third-party service instances or endpoints. In this situation, an endpoint refers to a particular service instance. For example, an SQL server would be considered an endpoint, and a collection of SQL servers would form a service endpoint group. Other examples of service EPGs would be a collection of Storage Accounts, a collection of Key Vaults, and so on.
Service EPGs have several unique attributes:
Service Type: This attribute indicates what type of cloud service is being grouped. Examples of available service types include Azure SQL, Azure Containter Registery, Azure ApiManagement Services, and so on. The service type Custom is used when configuring a third-party service EPG.
Deployment Type: This attribute indicates how and where the service is deployed. Following are the available deployment types:
Cloud Native: In this type of deployment, the service is instantiated in the cloud provider's network and the user or applications consuming it have a handle to the service. For example, an Azure storage account might reside inside Azure's own VNet, and you would have a URL to access the storage contents.
Cloud Native Managed: In this type of deployment, the service is instantiated in your VNet or subnet (created through the Cisco Cloud APIC). For example, an Azure Kubernetes cluster (AKS) could be deployed in a subnet that is managed by the Cisco Cloud APIC.
Third-Party: This is a deployment where a third-party (not Azure) is providing services through the market place. Access to this service is provided through the private links feature.
Access Type: This indicates how the service will be accessed. Following are the available access types:
Public: The service will be accessed using the public IP address assigned to it. Access to the public IP address range of a particular service is achieved using the Azure "Service Tags" in the NSG rules.
Private: The service will be accessed using a private IP address assigned to it. This assignment is done through the creation of private endpoints when the deployment is of type Cloud Native. In the case of a Cloud Native Managed deployment, the private IP is assigned by the service from the subnet IP space.
Only certain deployment types, and certain access types within each deployment type, are supported for each service type, described in the previous bullets. The following table provides more information on the deployment types and access types that are supported for each service type.

Service Endpoint selectors: Service endpoints can be selected using the existing selectors (used in the cloud EPG selection) as well as the new types of selectors listed below:
Resource Name: The service resource's name
Resource ID: The cloud provider's ID for the resource
URL: The alias or FQDN that identifies the service (the private link alias is used in Azure)
The following table provides more information on the endpoint selectors that are supported for each deployment type.

Note

Guidelines and Restrictions for Cloud Service EPGs
You must have the NSG-per-subnet configuration enabled if you are configuring cloud service EPGs.
A service EPG with a Cloud Native deployment type and a Public access type requires an NSG rule to allow access to the Azure PaaS service using Azure-defined tags. Cisco ACI Multi-Site Orchestrator will create the NSG rule only on sites where the service EPG that is configured as Cloud Native/Public is present; ACI Multi-Site Orchestrator will not create the NSG rule for remote sites. To make this work, local deployment of that service EPG should be present on all the sites.
For example, assume ACI Multi-Site Orchestrator is managing two sites (site1 and site2):
Site1 contains the service EPG configured as Cloud Native/Public, so ACI Multi-Site Orchestrator creates the NSG rule to allow access to an Azure PaaS service using the Azure-defined tags (for example, the Azure Key Vault service). Site1 is the provider for this service.
Site2 is the consumer for this service, and wants to access to site1's Azure Key Vault service.
In this situation, ACI Multi-Site Orchestrator will program the site1 VMs, but will not program the site2 VMs, so the site2 VMs cannot access the Azure Key Vault service provided by site1.
To make this work, deploy the Azure Key Vault service in site2 as well, where that Azure Key Vault service is just a dummy service, with no resources. By enabling that Azure Key Vault service on site2, the site2 VMs can then access the Azure Key Vault service on site 1 through ACI Multi-Site Orchestrator.
About Service Types
Additional information specific to certain service types are provided below:
Azure Storage
Azure ApiManagement Services
Azure Databricks Services
Azure Active Directory Domain Services
Azure Kubernetes Services
Azure Redis Cache
Azure Storage
The Azure Storage service type is a general service type that can be broken down into four subtypes:
Blob
File
Table
Queue
If you were to configure a service EPG with the following values, using the general Azure Storage service type:
Service type: Azure Storage
Deployment type: Cloud Native
Access type: Private
Then four private endpoints are automatically configured for this service EPG, one for each of the four subtypes listed above.
However, if you were to configure a service EPG with the following values, using a more specific Azure Storage service type:
Service type: One of these service types:
Azure Storage Blob
Azure Storage File
Azure Storage Table
Azure Storage Queue
Deployment type: Cloud Native
Access type: Private
Then only one private endpoint is automatically configured for this particular subtype for this service EPG.
Note that the four specific Azure Storage subtypes (Blob, File, Table, and Queue) are not allowed if you have an access type of Public with the deployment type of Cloud Native. This is because Azure service tags are not storage subtype specific.
Azure ApiManagement Services
For an Azure ApiManagement (APIM) Services instance to be deployed in a VNet, it needs to be able to access a lot of other Azure services. In order to do this, the security group rules that allow this access must be programmed.
Cisco Cloud APIC automates this and configures the rules listed here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-using-with-vnet#-common-network-configuration-issues
Azure Databricks Services
Azure Databricks requires the following:
Access to other services
Two subnets for deployment, where the subnets are delegated to Microsoft
For Azure Databricks, make the following configurations:
Before configuring the service EPG, you must configure two subnets specifically for the Azure Databricks Services.
When configuring the service EPG, you must create two service endpoint selectors that will be used to match the two service subnets.
Once the subnet is identified with the Azure Databricks service EPG through the configured endpoint selectors, Cisco Cloud APIC delegates subnets to Azure and configures the rules listed here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/azure/vnet-inject
Azure Active Directory Domain Services
Azure Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) requires the following:
Access to other services
No routing table is attached to the subnet when it is being deployed
The action of de-associating the routing table from the subnet should be done through the Azure portal after configuring the service EPG and before deploying ADDS. The routing table can be attached to the subnet after the deployment is completed.
Cisco Cloud APIC automates the programming of the rules listed here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-domain-services/network-considerations
Azure Kubernetes Services
Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) requires access to other services.
Cisco Cloud APIC automates the programming of the rules listed here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/limit-egress-traffic#required-outbound-network-rules-and-fqdns-for-aks-clusters
Azure Redis Cache
Azure Redis cache requires access to other services.
Cisco Cloud APIC automates the programming of the rules listed here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-how-to-premium-vnet#outbound-port-requirements
About Deployment Types
Additional information specific to certain deployment types are provided below:
Cloud Native
Cloud Native Managed
Cloud Native
In this type of deployment, the service is instantiated in the cloud provider's network and the user or applications consuming it have a handle to the service. For example, an Azure storage account might reside inside Azure's own VNet, and you would have a URL to access the storage contents.
The following is an example service EPG with a Cloud Native deployment type:
Service Type: Azure SQL
Deployment type: Cloud Native
Access type: Private
In this example scenario, you would make the following configurations in this order:
In the Cisco ACI Multi-Site Orchestrator, create a private link label in a cloud context profile to be used by the Azure SQL service EPG.
Follow the procedures in Tasks To Perform Prior to Configuring Service EPGs. Configure a private link label to be used by the Azure SQL service EPG (for example, SQL-PLL).
In the Cisco ACI Multi-Site Orchestrator, create a service EPG of the service type Azure SQL.
Follow the procedures in Creating a Service EPG, using the following parameters:
Service Type: Azure SQL
Deployment type: Cloud Native
Access type: Private
When you are configuring the endpoint selector as part of the process of configuring this type of service EPG, configure the endpoint selector to match the appropriate value for the SQL server.
For example, if you wanted to select an SQL server with the name ProdSqlServer, you would make the following selections:
Key: Name
Operator: equals
Value: ProdSqlServer
As another example, if you wanted to select an SQL server using the cloud provider's resource ID of /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Sql/servers/ProdSqlServer, you would make the following selections:
Key: Resource ID
Operator: equals
Value: /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Sql/servers/ProdSqlServer
In the Azure portal, configure the Azure SQL resources in the cloud.
Cloud Native Managed
In this type of deployment, the service is instantiated in your VNet or subnet (created through the Cisco ACI Multi-Site Orchestrator). For example, an Azure ApiManagement Services could be deployed in a subnet that is managed by the Cisco ACI Multi-Site Orchestrator.
The following is an example service EPG with a Cloud Native Managed deployment type:
Service Type: Azure ApiManagement Services
Deployment type: Cloud Native Managed
Access type: Private
In this example scenario, you would make the following configurations in this order:
In the Cisco ACI Multi-Site Orchestrator, create a subnet in a cloud context profile to be used by the Azure ApiManagement Services service EPG.
Follow the procedures in Tasks To Perform Prior to Configuring Service EPGs. Configure a subnet to be used by the Azure ApiManagement Services service EPG (for example, 10.50.0.0/16).
In the Cisco ACI Multi-Site Orchestrator, create a service EPG of the service type Azure ApiManagement Services.
Follow the procedures in Creating a Service EPG, using the following parameters:
Service Type: Azure ApiManagement Services
Deployment type: Cloud Native Managed
Access type: Private
When you are configuring the endpoint selector as part of the process of configuring this type of service EPG, configure the endpoint selector to match the IP address that you used when you created a subnet in the cloud context profile in the first step.
For example, using the example provided in the first step, you would configure this endpoint selector for this service EPG:
Key: IP
Operator: equals
Value: 10.50.0.0/16
In the Azure portal, configure the Azure ApiManagement Services resources in the cloud.
Tasks To Perform Prior to Configuring Service EPGs

Configuring Cloud Native as the Deployment Type
Use the procedures in this section to configure Cloud Native as the deployment type for the service EPG.
Procedure
Step 1
Navigate to site local.
Step 2
In the middle pane, scroll down to EPGs and click the service EPG that you just created.
Step 3
In the right pane, scroll down to the Selectors area.
Step 4
If you selected Private as the access type, the Private Link Labels option becomes available.
A private link label is used to associate the subnets to the service EPGs.
Step 5
Click Select Private Link Label.
The Select Private Link Label window appears.
Step 6
Search for the appropriate private link label.
Search for the private link label that you created using the procedures provided in Tasks To Perform Prior to Configuring Service EPGs.
Step 7
Click Add Selector.
Step 8
Enter a name in the Name field.
Step 9
Click the Key drop-down list to choose a key.
The options are:
Choose Custom if you want to create a custom endpoint selector.
Choose Region if you want to use the Azure region for the endpoint selector.
Choose Cloud Resource Name if you want to use the service resource's name for the endpoint selector.
For example, to select an SQL server with the name ProdSqlServer, you would choose Name in the Key field, and you would enter ProdSqlServer in the Value field later in these procedures.
Choose Cloud Resource ID if you want to use the cloud provider's ID for the endpoint selector.
For example, to select an SQL server using the cloud provider's resource ID, you would choose Resouce ID in the Key field, and you would enter the value of the selector, such as /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Sql/servers/ProdSqlServer, in the Value field later in these procedures.
Step 10
Click the Operator drop-down list to choose an operator.
The options are:
equals: Used when you have a single value in the Value field.
not equals: Used when you have a single value in the Value field.
in: Used when you have multiple comma-separated values in the Value field.
not in: Used when you have multiple comma-separated values in the Value field.
has key: Used if the expression contains only a key.
does not have key: Used if the expression contains only a key.
Step 11
Enter a value in the Value field then click the check mark to validate the entries.
The value you enter depends on the choices you made for the Key and Operator fields.
Step 12
When finished, click the check mark to validate the selector expression.
Step 13
Determine if you want to create additional expressions for the selector.
If you create more than one expression under a single selector, a logical AND exists between those expressions.
For example, assume you created two sets of expressions under a single selector:
Selector 1, expression 1:
Key: Region
Operator: equals
Value: westus
Selector 1, expression 2:
Key: Cloud Resource Name
Operator: equals
Value: ProdSqlServer
In this case, if both of these expressions are true (if the region is westus AND if the name attached to the resource is ProdSqlServer), then that endpoint is assigned to the service EPG.
Step 14
Click the check mark after every additional expression that you want to create under this selector, then click Add when finished.
Step 15
If you want to create additional endpoint selectors, click Add Endpoint Selector again and repeat these steps to create additional endpoint selectors.
If you create more than one endpoint selector under an EPG, a logical OR exists between those endpoint selectors. For example, assume you had created endpoint selector 1 as described in the previous step, and then you created a second endpoint selector as described below:
Endpoint selector 2, expression 1:
Key: Region
Operator: in
Value: eastus, centralus
In this case:
If the region is westus AND the name attached to the resource is ProdSqlServer (endpoint selector 1 expressions)
OR
If the region is either eastus or centralus (endpoint selector 2 expression)
Then that end point is assigned to the service EPG.
Step 16
Click Save when finished.
Configuring Cloud Native Managed as the Deployment Type
Use the procedures in this section to configure Cloud Native Managed as the deployment type for the service EPG.
Procedure
Step 1
Navigate to site local.
Step 2
In the middle pane, scroll down to EPGs and click the service EPG that you just created.
Step 3
In the right pane, scroll down to the Selectors area.
Step 4
Click Add Selector.
The Add Selector window appears.
Step 5
In the Add Selector window, enter a name in the Name field.
Step 6
Click the Key drop-down list to choose a key.
At this time, IP is the only option available as a key for this access type.
Step 7
Click the Operator drop-down list to choose an operator.
The options are:
equals: Used when you have a single value in the Value field.
not equals: Used when you have a single value in the Value field.
in: Used when you have multiple comma-separated values in the Value field.
not in: Used when you have multiple comma-separated values in the Value field.
has key: Used if the expression contains only a key.
does not have key: Used if the expression contains only a key.
Step 8
Enter the appropriate IP address or a subnet in the Value field then click the check mark to validate the entries.
Enter the IP address or subnet that you created using the procedures provided in Tasks To Perform Prior to Configuring Service EPGs.
Step 9
When finished, click the check mark to validate the selector expression.
Step 10
Determine if you want to create additional endpoint selector expressions to the endpoint selector.
If you create more than one expression under a single endpoint selector, a logical AND exists between those expressions.
For example, assume you created two sets of expressions under a single endpoint selector:
Endpoint selector 1, expression 1:
Key: IP
Operator: equals
Value: 192.1.1.1/24
Endpoint selector 1, expression 2:
Key: IP
Operator: not equals
Value: 192.1.1.2
In this case, if both of these expressions are true (if the IP address belongs to subnet 192.1.1.1/24 AND the IP address is not 192.1.1.2), then that endpoint is assigned to the service EPG.
Step 11
Click the check mark after every additional expression that you want to create under this endpoint selector, then click Add when finished.
You are returned to the Create EPG screen, with the new endpoint selector and the configured expressions shown.
Step 12
If you want to create additional endpoint selectors, click Add Endpoint Selector again and repeat these steps to create additional endpoint selectors.
If you create more than one endpoint selector under an EPG, a logical OR exists between those endpoint selectors. For example, assume you had created endpoint selector 1 as described in the previous step, and then you created a second endpoint selector as described below:
Endpoint selector 2, expression 1:
Key: IP
Operator: equals
Value: 192.2.2.2/24
In this case:
If the IP address belongs to subnet 192.1.1.1/24 AND the IP address is not 192.1.1.2 (endpoint selector 1 expressions)
OR
If the IP address belongs to subnet 192.2.2.2/24
Then that end point is assigned to the service EPG.
Step 13
Click Save when finished.
Configuring Third-Party as the Deployment Type
Use the procedures in this section to configure Third-Party as the deployment type for the service EPG. Private is the only option available to you as an access type. This means that you will use only private endpoints to the service, if the service offers it.

Note
You must choose Custom as the Service Type if you choose Third-Party as the Deployment Type.
Procedure
Step 1
Navigate to site local.
Step 2
In the middle pane, scroll down to EPGs and click the service EPG that you just created.
Step 3
In the right pane, scroll down to the Selectors area.
The Select Private Link Label option becomes available with this access type. A private link label is used to associate the subnets to the service EPGs.
Step 4
Click Select Private Link Label.
The Select Private Link Label window appears.
Step 5
Search for the appropriate private link label.
Search for the private link label that you created using the procedures provided in Tasks To Perform Prior to Configuring Service EPGs.
Step 6
Click Add Selector.
The Add Selector window appears.
Step 7
In the Add Endpoint Selector window, enter a name in the Name field.
Step 8
Click the Key drop-down list to choose a key.
At this time, URL is the only option available as a key for this access type, where you will use the alias or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that identifies the service for the endpoint selector.
Step 9
Click the Operator drop-down list to choose an operator.
The options are:
equals: Used when you have a single value in the Value field.
not equals: Used when you have a single value in the Value field.
in: Used when you have multiple comma-separated values in the Value field.
not in: Used when you have multiple comma-separated values in the Value field.
has key: Used if the expression contains only a key.
does not have key: Used if the expression contains only a key.
Step 10
Enter a valid URL in the Value field then click the check mark to validate the entries.
Step 11
When finished, click the check mark to validate the selector expression, then click Add.
You are returned to the Create EPG screen, with the new endpoint selector and the configured expression shown.
Step 12
If you want to create additional endpoint selectors, click Add Endpoint Selector again and repeat these steps to create additional endpoint selectors.
If you create more than one endpoint selector under an EPG, a logical OR exists between those endpoint selectors.
For example, assume you created two endpoint selectors as described below:
Endpoint selector 1:
Key: URL
Operator: equals
Value: www.acme1.com
Endpoint selector 2:
Key: URL
Operator: equals
Value: www.acme2.com
In this case:
If the URL is www.acme1.com
OR
If the URL is www.acme2.com
Then that end point is assigned to the service EPG.
Step 13
Click Save when finished.
