Introduction
This article describes the process of rehosting licenses from a failed product as part of specific license reservation (SLR) in Cisco Smart Software Manager (CSSM).
If the license rehost from a failed product results in the Insufficient Licenses alert on your Virtual account, then the system allows you to rehost licenses for product instances only up to a certain threshold which is 10% of the product instances on your Virtual account.
Anytime you attempt to rehost licenses from a product instance, the system checks whether this action would result in the Insufficient Licenses alert which indicates that you are reserving more licenses than what you have available on your Virtual account. The system applies the following logic:
 If you have a sufficient quantity of licenses on your Virtual account, then the system allows you to rehost licenses without checking the threshold.
If you have an insufficient quantity of licenses, the system checks the threshold and does not allow for license rehost for more than 10% of the product instances on your Virtual account.
The system applies the threshold to the total number of product instances on your Virtual account to identify how many product instances you can rehost (round off to the next highest whole number after applying threshold percentage).
For example:
• For 1-10 product instances on your Virtual account, you could rehost one product instance.
• For 11-20 product instances on your Virtual account, you could rehost two product instances.
• For 21-30 product instances on your Virtual account, you could rehost three product instances.
Prerequisites

Active Cisco.com account
Smart account user, or Smart account administrator, or Virtual account user, or Virtual account administrator role (To request access to a Smart account or Virtual account, refer to How to Request Access to an Existing Smart Account.)

ClickClose. 
Step result: The system displays the notification message that confirms that you successfully downloaded the file with the authorization code.

Verification Step: On theInventorytab, select your Virtual account, clickEvent Log, search by product of the replacement device, and then pressEnter.
