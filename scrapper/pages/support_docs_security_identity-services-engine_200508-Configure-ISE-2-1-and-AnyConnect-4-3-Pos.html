Introduction
This document describes how to configure the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) to provide full access to the network only when USB mass storage devices are disconnected.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:
Basic knowledge of Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) CLI configuration and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) VPN configuration
Basic knowledge of remote access VPN configuration on the ASA
Basic knowledge of ISE and posture services
Components Used
Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) version 2.1 along with AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client 4.3 supports USB Mass Storage Check and Remediation. The information in this document is based on these software versions:
Cisco ASA software Versions 9.2(4) and later
Microsoft Windows Version 7 with Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Version 4.3 and later
Cisco ISE, Release 2.1 and later
Configure
Network Diagram
The flow is the following:
User is not connected to VPN yet, private USB Mass Storage device is plugged in and content is available for the user
VPN session initiated by AnyConnect client is authenticated via ISE. Posture status of the endpoint is not known, rule "Posture_Unknown" is hit and as a result the session will be redirected to the ISE
The USB checks introduces a new class of checks in AC ISE posture, in that they will continuously monitor the endpoint as long as it remains in the same ISE controlled network.The only logical remediation action available is to block the USB device(s) identified by their drive letter
VPN session on ASA is updated, redirect ACL is removed and full access is granted
VPN session has been presented just as an example. Posture functionality is working fine also for other types of the access.
ASA
ASA is configured for remote SSL VPN access using ISE as AAA server. Radius CoA along with redirect ACL needs to be configured:
aaa-server ISE21 protocol radius
 authorize-only
 interim-accounting-update periodic 1
 dynamic-authorization
aaa-server ISE21 (outside) host 10.48.23.88

AnyConnect 4.0 Integration with ISE Version 1.3 Configuration Example
ISE
Step 1. Configure Network Device
From Administration > Network Resources > Network Devices > add ASA.
Step 2. Configure Posture conditions and policies
Make sure posture conditions are updated: Administration > System > Settings > Posture > Updates > Update now option.
ISE 2.1 comes with a preconfigured USB Condition, which checks if a USB mass storage device is connected.
From Policy > Policy Elements > Conditions > Posture > USB Condition verify existing condition:
From Policy > Policy Elements > Results > Posture > Requirements, verify preconfigured requirement which uses that condition.
From Policy > Posture, add a condition for all Windows to use that requirement:
From Policy > Policy Elements > Results > Posture > Remediation Actions > USB Remediations verify preconfigured remediation action to block USB storage devices:
Step 3. Configure Client Provisioning resources and policy
From Policy > Policy Elements > Client Provisioning > Resources download compliance module from Cisco.com and upload manually the AnyConnect 4.3 package:
Using Add > NAC Agent or AnyConnect Posture Profile create an AnyConnect Posture profile (name: Anyconnect_Posture_Profile) with default settings.
Using Add > AnyConnect Configuration add an AnyConnect Configuration (name: AnyConnect Configuration):
From Policy > Client Provisioning create a new policy (Windows_Posture) for Windows to use the AnyConnect Configuration:
Step 4. Configure Authorization rules
From Policy > Policy Elements > Results > Authorization add an Authorization Profile (name: Posture_Redirect) that redirects to a default Client Provisioning Portal:
Note: ACL_WEBAUTH_REDIRECT ACL is defined on ASA.
From Policy > Authorization create an authorization rule for redirection. An authorization rule for Compliant devices is preconfigured on ISE:
If the endpoint is compliant, full access is provided. If status is unknown or noncompliant, redirection for Client Provisioning is returned.
Verify
Before VPN session establishment
USB device plugged in, and its content is available for the user.
VPN session establishment
During authentication, ISE will return redirect access-list and redirect url as part of Posture_Redirect Authorization Profile
Once the VPN session is established, ASA traffic from the client will get redirected according to redirect access-list:

  Redirect ACL : ACL_WEBAUTH_REDIRECT
Client Provisioning
At that stage, endpoint web browser traffic is redirected to ISE for client provisioning:
If needed, AnyConnect along with the Posture and Compliance module is updated.
Posture check and CoA
Posture module is executed, discover ISE (it might be required to have DNS A record for enroll.cisco.com to succeed), download and check posture conditions, new OPSWAT v4 block USB device action. Configured message will be displayed for the user:
Once the message is confirmed, USB device is no longer available for the user:
ASA removes redirection ACL providing full access. AnyConnect reports compliance:
Also detailed reports on ISE can confirm that required conditions are passed.
Posture Assessment by Condition:
Posture Assessment by Endpoint:
Details of Endpoint Report:
Troubleshoot
ISE is able to provide the details on the failing conditions, actions should be taken accordingly.
