Bias-Free Language
The Cisco® ONS 15216 8-Channel CWDM Multiplexer/Demultiplexer is a passive unit that in the transmit direction, combines eight ITU-T G.694.2 coarse wavelength-division multiplexing (CWDM) wavelengths into a composite signal. In the receive direction, the unit separates a composite signal into eight individual wavelengths.
Applications
The Cisco ONS 15216 8-Channel CWDM Multiplexer/Demultiplexer (Figure 1) is ideal for building point-to-point networks with limited scale requirements. Gigabit Ethernet and Fibre Channel (1-, 2-, and 4-Gbps) CWDM wavelengths can be provisioned using Cisco CWDM Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP) units housed directly in Cisco routers and switches, while 10-Gbps CWDM wavelengths are supported through the Multirate DWDM OTU2 XPonder Card for the Cisco ONS 15454 MSTP card hosting CWDM 10-Gigabit Small Form-Factor Pluggable (XFP) units. This card supports two wavelengths and can be housed in the Cisco ONS 15454 M2 or M6 chassis, providing a small, cost-effective, AC-powered solution for 10-Gbps CWDM applications.

Edge Mounting Bracket
The Cisco ONS 15216 8-Channel CWDM Multiplexer/Demultiplexer occupies two positions in the Cisco ONS 15216 Edge Mounting Bracket. The mounting bracket occupies one rack unit (1RU) and mounts into a standard 19-inch rack. It has four positions for mounting Optical Add/Drop Multiplexers (OADMs).
