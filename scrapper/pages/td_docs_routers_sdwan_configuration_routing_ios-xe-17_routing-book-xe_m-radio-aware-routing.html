Radio-Aware Routing Support
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1
This feature enables Radio-Aware Routing (RAR) support on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. RAR is a mechanism that uses radio signals to interact with the routing protocol OSPFv3 to signal the appearance, disappearance, and link conditions of one-hop routing neighbors. In large mobile networks, connections to the routing neighbors are interrupted due to distance and radio obstructions. RAR addresses the challenges faced by merging IP routing and radio communications in mobile networks.

Supported Devices for RAR
The following platforms support RAR:
Cisco 4000 Series Integrated Services Routers
Cisco 1000 Series Integrated Services Routers
Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers
Cisco CSR 1000 Series Cloud Service Routers
Cisco CSR 8000 Series Cloud Service Routers
Prerequisites for RAR
The RAR configuration requires Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) support. To use the PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) and virtual multipoint interface (VMI) features for RAR, a unified representation of the MANET to routing protocols (OSPFv3 or EIGRP) is required.
Benefits of RAR
The Radio Aware Routing feature offers the following benefits:
Provides faster network convergence through immediate recognition of changes.
Enables routing for failing or fading radio links.
Allows easy routing between line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight paths.
Provides faster convergence and optimal route selection so that delay-sensitive traffic, such as voice and video, is not disrupted
Provides efficient radio resources and bandwidth usage.
Reduces impact on the radio links by performing congestion control in the router.
Allows route selection based on radio power conservation.
Enables decoupling of the routing and radio functionalities.
Provides simple Ethernet connection to RFC 5578, R2CP, and DLEP compliant radios.
Restrictions for RAR
The Radio Aware Routing feature has the following restrictions:
The Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) and Router to Radio Control Protocol (R2CP) protocols are not supported.
Multicast traffic is not supported in aggregate mode.
Cisco High Availability (HA) technology is not supported.
Information about RAR
Radio-Aware Routing (RAR) is a mechanism that uses radio interfaces to interact with the Open Shortest Path First (OSPFv3) protocol to signal the appearance and link conditions of one-hop routing neighbors.
In large mobile network, distance and radio obstructions often interrupt the connections to the routing neighbors. When these signals do not reach the routing protocols, protocol timers are used to update the status of a neighbor. Routing protocols have lengthy timer, which is not recommended in mobile networks.
The connectivity between two Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices happen over a PPPoE connection using variable bandwidth and a limited buffering. OSPFv3 and EIGRP are the supported routing protocols.

Overview of RAR
The following topology shows the RAR deployment on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
Figure 1. RAR Architecture
The four Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices connect to each other through a radio connected to a physical interface on the device
PPPoE-RAR configurations happen on all three routers and once the underlay RAR network is established, the Cisco SD-WAN tunnels form on the network.
The loopback interface acts as a WAN interface and binds to the Virtual Multipoint interface (VMI). The VMI interface in turn binds to the physical interface
The PPP connections between any two devices act as the underlay network.
The Cisco SD-WAN tunnels are established over the PPPoE-RAR underlay network.
Cisco vManage, Cisco vSmart Controllers, and Cisco vBond Controllers connect through a radio connection in the deployment scenario.
Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs)
MANETs for device-to-radio communications address the challenges faced when merging IP routing and mobile radio communications in ad hoc networking applications. MANET-routing protocols provide signaling among MANET routers, including scope-limited flooding and point-to-point delivery of MANET routing protocol signaling in a network.
System Components of RAR
The Radio Aware Routing (RAR) feature is implemented using the MANET (Mobile adhoc network) infrastructure comprising of different components such as PPPoE, Virtual multipoint interface (VMI), QoS, routing protocol interface and RAR protocols.
Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet PPPoE or PPPoE
PPPoE is a well-defined communication mechanism between the client and the server. In the RAR implementation, radio takes the role of the PPPoE client and router takes the role of the PPPoE server. This allows a loose coupling of radio and router, while providing a well-defined and predictable communication mechanism.
As PPPoE is a session or a connection oriented protocol, it extends the point-to-point radio frequency (RF) link from an external radio to an IOS router.
PPPoE Extensions
PPPoE extensions are used when the router communicates with the radio. In the Cisco IOS implementation of PPPoE, each individual session is represented by virtual access interface (connectivity to a radio neighbor) on which, QoS can be applied with these PPPoE extensions.
RFC5578 provides extensions to PPPoE to support credit-based flow control and session-based real time link metrics, which are very useful for connections with variable bandwidth and limited buffering capabilities (such as radio links).
Virtual Multipoint Interface (VMI)
Though PPPoE Extensions provides the most of the setup to communicate between a router and a radio, VMI addresses the need to manage and translate events that higher layers (example, routing protocols) consume. In addition, VMI operates in the Bypass mode.
In Bypass mode, every Virtual Access Interface (VAI) representing a radio neighbor is exposed to routing protocols OSPFv3 and EIGRP, so that, the routing protocol directly communicates with the respective VAI for both unicast and multicast routing protocol traffic.
In Aggregate mode, VMI is exposed to the routing protocols (OSPF) so that the routing protocols can leverage VMI for their optimum efficiency. When the network neighbors are viewed as a collection of networks on a point-to-multipoint link with broadcast and multicast capability at VMI, VMI helps in aggregating the multiple virtual access interfaces created from PPPoE. VMI presents a single multi access layer 2 broadcast capable interface. The VMI layer handles re-directs unicast routing protocol traffic to the appropriate P2P link (Virtual-Access interface), and replicats any Multicast/Broadcast traffic that needs to flow. Since the routing protocol communicates to a single interface, the size of the topology database is reduced, without impacting the integrity of the network.
Configure RAR
To configure RAR using Cisco vManage, Create a CLI add-on feature template and attach it to the device template.
This section provides examples of RAR configurations that you can add to the CLI add-on template.

Configure the RAR Feature in Bypass Mode
The following example is an end-to-end configuration of RAR in the bypass mode:

Note
Before you begin the RAR configuration, you must first configure the subscriber authorization enable command to bring up the RAR session. Without enbaling authorization, the Point-to-Point protocol does not recognize this as a RAR session and may not tag manet_radio in PPPoE protocol. By default, bypass mode does not appears in the configuration. It appears only if the mode is configured as bypass.
