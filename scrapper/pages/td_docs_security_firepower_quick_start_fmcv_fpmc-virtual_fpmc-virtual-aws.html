Chapter: Deploy the Management Center Virtual On the AWS Cloud
Chapter Contents
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources into a virtual network that you define. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that might operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.
You can deploy the management center virtual on the AWS Cloud.

Management Center Virtual Requires 28 GB RAM for Upgrade (6.6.0+)
The management center virtual platform has introduced a new memory check during upgrade. The management center virtual upgrades to Version 6.6.0+ will fail if you allocate less than 28 GB RAM to the virtual appliance.

Important
As of the Version 6.6.0 release, lower-memory instance types for cloud-based management center virtual deployments (AWS, Azure) are fully deprecated. You cannot create the new management center virtual instances using them, even for earlier versions. You can continue running existing instances. See Table 1.
As a result of this memory check, we will not be able to support lower memory instances on supported platforms.
The following table summarizes the AWS instances types that the management center virtual supports; those that Versions 6.5.x and earlier support, and those that Version 6.6.0+ support.

Note
Version 6.6 adds support for the C5 instance types shown in the following table. Larger instance types provide more CPU resources to your AWS VMs for increased performance, and some allow for more network interfaces.

*Note that the management center virtual will not support these instance types on Version 6.6.0 and above. Beginning with Version 6.6.0, you must deploy the management center virtual (any version) using an instance with at least 28 GB RAM. See Deprecated Instances and Resizing Instances for more information.

Platform
Version 7.1.0+
Management Center Virtual 300 (FMCv300)
c5.9xlarge: 36 vCPUs, 72 GB
SSD storage: 2000 GB
Deprecated Instances
You can continue running your current Version 6.5.x and earlier management center virtual deployments, but you will not be able to launch the new management center virtual deployments (any version) using these instances:
c3.xlarge—4 vCPUs, 7.5 GB (DISABLED for the management center virtual after Version 6.6.0+)
c3.2xlarge—8 vCPUs, 15 GB (DISABLED for the management center virtual after Version 6.6.0+)
c4.xlarge—4 vCPUs, 7.5 GB (DISABLED for the management center virtual after Version 6.6.0+)
c4.2xlarge—8 vCPUs, 15 GB (DISABLED for the management center virtual after Version 6.6.0+)
Resizing Instances
Because the upgrade path from any earlier version of management center virtual (6.2.x, 6.3.x, 6.4.x, and 6.5.x) to Version 6.6.0 includes the 28 GB RAM memory check, you need to resize your current instance type to one that supports Version 6.6.0 (see Table 1).
You can resize an instance if the current instance type and the new instance type that you want are compatible. For the management center virtual deployments:
Resize any c3.xlarge or c3.2xlarge to the c3.4xlarge instance type.
Resize any c4.xlarge or c4.2xlarge to the c4.4xlarge instance type.
Be aware of the following before resizing your instance:
You must stop your instance before you change instance types.
Verify that your current instance type is compatible with the new instance type that you choose.
If this instance has an instance store volume, any data on it is lost when the instance is stopped. Migrate your instance store-backed instance before you resize.
If you're not using an Elastic IP address, the public IP address is released when you stop the instance.
For instructions on how to resize your instance, see the AWS documentation “Changing the Instance Type” (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-resize.html).
AWS Solution Overview
AWS Solution Overview
AWS is a collection of remote computing services offered by Amazon.com, also called web services, that make up a cloud-computing platform. These services operate from 11 geographical regions across the world. In general, you should become familiar with the following AWS services when deploying the management center virtual:
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)—a web service that enables you to rent virtual computers to launch and manage your own applications and service, such as a firewall, in Amazon's data centers.
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)—a web service that enables you to configure an isolated private network that exists within the Amazon public cloud. You run you EC2 instances within a VPC.
Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)—a web service that provides you with a data storage infrastructure.
You create an account on AWS, set up the VPC and EC2 components (using either the AWS Wizards or manual configuration), and chose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) instance. The AMI is a template that contains the software configuration needed to launch your instance.

Note
The AMI images are not available for download outside of the AWS environment.
Guidelines and Limitations for AWS Deployment
Supported Features (7.1.0+)
Management Center Virtual 300 (FMCv300) for AWS—A new scaled management center virtual image is available on the AWS platform that supports managing up to 300 devices and has higher disk capacity.

Create the VPC
A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS cloud. You can launch your AWS resources, such as management center virtual instances, into your VPC. You can configure your VPC; you can select its IP address range, create subnets, and configure route tables, network gateways, and security settings.
Before you begin
Create your AWS account.
Confirm that AMIs are available for the management center virtual instances.
Procedure
Step 1
Log into aws.amazon.com and choose your region.
AWS is divided into multiple regions that are isolated from each other. The region is displayed in the upper right corner of your screen. Resources in one region do not appear in another region. Check periodically to make sure you are in the intended region.
Step 2
Click Services > VPC.
Step 3
Click VPC Dashboard > Your VPCs.
Step 4
Click Create VPC.
Step 5
Enter the following in the Create VPC dialog box:

A CIDR block of IP addresses. The range of IP addresses in the subnet must be a subset of the range of IP addresses in the VPC. Block sizes must be between a /16 network mask and a /28 network mask. The size of the subnet can equal the size of the VPC.
Step 4
Click Yes, Create to create your subnet.
Step 5
Repeat for as many subnets required. Create a separate subnet for management traffic and create as many subnets as needed for data traffic.
What to do next
Add a route table to your VPC as described in the next section.
Add a Route Table
You can attach a route table to the gateway you configured for your VPC. You can also associate multiple subnets with a single route table, but a subnet can be associated with only one route table at a time.
Procedure
Step 1
Click Services > VPC.
Step 2
Click VPC Dashboard > Route Tables, and then click Create Route Table.
Step 3
Enter a user-defined Name tag to identify the route table.
Step 4
Select the VPC from the drop-down list that will use this route table.
Step 5
Click Yes, Create to create your route table.
Step 6
Select the route table that you just created.
Step 7
Click the Routes tab to display the route information in the details pane.
Step 8
Click Edit, then click Add another route.
In the Destination column, enter 0.0.0.0/0.
In the Target column, select the Internet Gateway you created above.
Step 9
Click Save.
Step 10
Click the Subnet Associations tab and click Edit.
Step 11
Check the box next to the subnet to be used for the management center virtual's management interface and click Save.
What to do next
Create a security group as described in the next section.
Create a Security Group
You can create a security group with rules specifying allowed protocols, ports and source IP ranges. Multiple security groups can be created with different rules which you can assign to each instance. AWS has detailed documentation on Security Groups if you are not familiar with this feature.
Procedure
Step 1
Click Services > EC2.
Step 2
Click EC2 Dashboard > Security Groups.
Step 3
Click Create Security Group.
Step 4
Enter the following in the Create Security Group dialog box:
A user-defined Security group name to identify the security group.
A Description for this security group.
The VPC associated with this security group.
Step 5
Configure Security group rules:
Click the Inbound tab, then click Add Rule.
Note
  HTTPS and SSH access is required to manage the management center virtual from outside AWS. You should specify the Source IP addresses accordingly. Also, if you are configuring both the management center virtual and threat defense virtual within the AWS VPC, you should allow the private IP management subnet access.
Click the Outbound tab, then click Add Rule to add a rule for outbound traffic, or leave the defaults of All traffic (for Type) and Anywhere (for Destination).
Step 6
Click Create to create your security group.
What to do next
Create network interfaces as described in the next section.
Create Network Interfaces
You can create network interfaces for the management center virtual using static IP addresses. Create network interfaces (external and internal) as needed for your particular deployment.
Procedure
Step 1
Click Services > EC2.
Step 2
Click EC2 Dashboard > Network Interfaces.
Step 3
Click Create Network Interface.
Step 4
Enter the following in the Create Network Interface dialog box:
A optional user-defined Description for the network interface.
Select a Subnet from the drop-down list. Make sure to select the subnet of the VPC where you want to create the instance.
Enter a Private IP address. It is recommended to use a static IP address rather than auto-assign.
Select one or more Security groups. Make sure the security group has all the required ports open.
Step 5
Click Yes, Create to create your network interface.
Step 6
Select the network interface that you just created.
Step 7
Right-click and select Change Source/Dest. Check.
Step 8
Choose Disabled, then click Save.
Repeat this for any network interfaces you create.
What to do next
Create elastic IP addresses as described in the next section.
Create Elastic IPs
When an instance is created, a public IP address is associated with the instance. That public IP address changes automatically when you STOP and START the instance. To resolve this issue, assign a persistent public IP address to the instance using Elastic IP addressing. Elastic IPs are reserved public IPs that are used for remote access to the management center virtual as well as other instances. AWS has detailed documentation on Elastic IPs if you are not familiar with this feature.

Note
At a minimum, you want to create one elastic IP addresses for the management center virtual and two elastic IP addresses for the threat defense virtual management and diagnostic interfaces.
Procedure
Step 1
Click Services > EC2.
Step 2
Click EC2 Dashboard > Elastic IPs.
Step 3
Click Allocate New Address.
Repeat this step for as many elastic/public IPs that you require.
Step 4
Click Yes, Allocate to create your elastic IP.
Step 5
Repeat for as many elastic IPs required for your deployment.
What to do next
Deploy the management center virtual as described in the next section.
Deploy the Management Center Virtual Instance
Before you begin
Configure AWS VPC and EC2 elements as described in Configuring Your AWS Environment.
Confirm that an AMI is available for the management center virtual instances.

Note
The default admin password is the AWS Instance ID, unless you define a default password with user data (Advanced Details > User Data) during the initial deployment.
Procedure
Step 1
Go to https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace (Amazon Marketplace) and sign in.
Step 2
After you are logged in to the Amazon Marketplace, click the link provided for the management center virtual.
Note
  If you were previously in AWS, you may need to sign out and then sign back in for the link to work.
Step 3
Click Continue, then click the Manual Launch tab.
Step 4
Click Accept Terms.
Step 5
Click Launch with EC2 Console in your desired region
Step 6
Choose an Instance Type supported by the management center virtual; see About Deployment On the AWS Cloud for the supported instance types.
Step 7
Click the Next: Configure Instance Details button at the bottom of the screen:
Change the Network to match your previously created VPC.
Change the Subnet to match your previously created management subnet. You can specify an IP address or use auto-generate.
Under Advanced Details > User Data, add the default login information.
Modify the example below to match your requirements for device name and password.
Sample login configuration:
#FMC
{
"AdminPassword": "<enter_your_password>",
"Hostname": "<Hostname-vFMC>"
}
Caution
  Use only plain text when entering data in the Advanced Details field. If you copy this information from a text editor, make sure you copy only as plain text. If you copy any Unicode data into the Advanced Details field, including white space, the instance may be corrupted and you will have to terminate the instance and re-create it.
In Version 7.0 and greater, the default admin password is the AWS Instance ID, unless you define a default password with user data (Advanced Details > User Data) during the initial deployment.
In earlier releases the default admin password was Admin123.
Step 8
Click Next: Add Storage to configure your storage device settings.
Edit the settings of the root volume so the volume Size (GiB) is 250 GiB. Less than 250 GiB will limit event storage and is not supported.
Step 9
Click Next: Tag Instance.
A tag consists of a case-sensitive key-value pair. For example, you could define a tag with Key = Name and Value = Management.
Step 10
Select Next: Configure Security Group.
Step 11
Click Select an existing Security Group and choose the previously configured Security Group, or create a new Security Group; see AWS documentation for more information on creating Security Groups.
Step 12
Click Review and Launch.
Step 13
Click Launch.
Step 14
Select an existing key pair or create a new key pair.
Note
  You can select an existing key pair, or create a new key pair. The key pair consists of a public key that AWS stores and a private key file that the user stores. Together they allow you to connect to your instance securely. Be sure to save the key pair to a known location, as it will may be required to connect to the instance.
Step 15
Click Launch Instances.
Step 16
Click EC2 Dashboard > Elastic IPs and find a previously allocated IP, or allocate a new one.
Step 17
Select the elastic IP, right-click and select Associate Address.
Locate the Instance or Network Interface to select, then click Associate.
Step 18
Click EC2 Dashboard > Instances.
Step 19
The management center virtual Instance state will show “running” and Status checks will show pass for “2/2 checks” after only a few minutes. However, deployment and initial setup processes will take approximately 30 to 40 minutes to complete. To view the status, right-click the Instance, then select Instance Settings > Get Instance Screenshot.
When setup is complete (after approximately 30 to 40 minutes), the Instance Screenshot should show a message similar to “Cisco Firepower Management Center for AWS vW.X.Y (build ZZ)” and possibly followed by some additional lines of output.
You should then be able to log in to the newly created the management center virtual using SSH or HTTPs. Actual deployment times may vary depending on the AWS load in your region.
You can access the management center virtual using SSH:
ssh -i <key_pair>.pem admin@<Public_Elastic_IP>
SSH authentication is handled by a key pair. No password is required. If you are prompted for a password then setup is still running.
You can also access the management center virtual using HTTPS:
https//<Public_Elastic_IP>
Note
  If you see a “system startup processes are still running” then setup is not yet complete.
If you get no response from SSH or HTTPS, double check these items:
Make sure deployment is complete. The management center virtual VM Instance Screenshot should show a message similar to “Cisco Firepower Management Center for AWS vW.X.Y (build ZZ)” and possibly followed by some additional lines of output.
Make sure you have an Elastic IP and that it is associated with the management center's management network interface (eni) and that you are connecting to that IP address.
Make sure there is an Internet Gateway (igw) associated with your VPC.
Make sure your management subnet has a route table associated with it.
Make sure the route table associated with your Management subnet has a route for “0.0.0.0/0” that points to your Internet gateway (igw).
Make sure your Security Group allows incoming SSH and/or HTTPS from the IP addresses you are connecting from.
What to do next
Configuring Policies and Device Settings
After you install the threat defense virtual and add the device to the Management Center, you can use the management center user interface to configure device management settings for the threat defense virtual running on AWS and to configure and apply access control policies and other related policies to manage traffic using your threat defense virtual device. The security policy controls the services provided by the threat defense virtual, such as Next Generation IPS filtering and application filtering. You configure the security policy on the threat defense virtual using the management center. For information about how to configure the security policy, see the Configuration Guide or the online help in Management Center.
