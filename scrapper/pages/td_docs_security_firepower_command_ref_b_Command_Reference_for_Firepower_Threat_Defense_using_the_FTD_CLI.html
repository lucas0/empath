Chapter: Using the Command Line Interface (CLI)
Chapter Contents
The following topics explain how to use the command line interface (CLI) for Secure Firewall Threat Defense devices and how to interpret the command reference topics. Use the CLI for basic system setup and troubleshooting.

Note
When you deploy a configuration change using the Secure Firewall Management Center or Secure Firewall device manager, do not use the threat defense CLI for long-running commands (such as ping with a huge repeat count or size); these commands could cause a deployment failure.

Logging Into the Command Line Interface (CLI)
To log into the CLI, use an SSH client to make a connection to the management IP address. Log in using the admin username (default password is Admin123) or another CLI user account.
You can also connect to the address on a data interface if you open the interface for SSH connections. SSH access to data interfaces is disabled by default. To enable SSH access, use the device manager (management center or device manager) to allow SSH connections to specific data interfaces. You cannot SSH to the Diagnostic interface.
You can create user accounts that can log into the CLI using the configure user add command. However, these users can log into the CLI only. They cannot log into the device manager web interface. The CLI supports local authentication only. You cannot access the CLI using external authentication.
Console Port Access
In addition to SSH, you can directly connect to the Console port on the device. Use the console cable included with the device to connect your PC to the console using a terminal emulator set for 9600 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, no flow control. See the hardware guide for your device for more information about the console cable.
The initial CLI you access on the Console port differs by device type.
ASA hardware platforms—The CLI on the Console port is the regular threat defense CLI.
Other hardware platforms—The CLI on the Console port is Secure Firewall eXtensible Operating System (FXOS). You can get to the threat defense CLI using the connect command. Use the FXOS CLI for chassis-level configuration and troubleshooting only. For the Firepower 2100, you cannot perform any configuration at the FXOS CLI. Use the threat defense CLI for basic configuration, monitoring, and normal system troubleshooting. See the FXOS documentation for information on FXOS commands for the Firepower 4100 and 9300. See the FXOS troubleshooting guide for information on FXOS commands for other models.
Command Modes
The CLI on a threat defense device has different modes, which are really separate CLIs rather than sub-modes to a single CLI. You can tell which mode you are in by looking at the command prompt.
Regular Threat Defense CLI
Use this CLI for threat defense management configuration and troubleshooting.
>
Diagnostic CLI
Use this CLI for advanced troubleshooting. This CLI includes additional show and other commands, including the session wlan console command needed to enter the CLI for the wireless access point on an ASA 5506W-X. This CLI has two sub-modes; more commands are available in Privileged EXEC Mode.
To enter this mode, use the system support diagnostic-cli command in the threat defense CLI.
User EXEC Mode. The prompt reflects the system hostname as defined in the running configuration.
firepower>
Privileged EXEC Mode. Enter the enable command to enter this mode (press enter without entering a password when prompted for a password). Note that you cannot set a password for this mode. Access is protected by the account login to the threat defense CLI only. However, users cannot enter configuration mode within Privileged EXEC mode, so the extra password protection is not necessary.

Expert Mode
Use Expert Mode only if a documented procedure tells you it is required, or if the Cisco Technical Assistance Center asks you to use it. To enter this mode, use the expert command in the threat defense CLI.
The prompt is username@hostname if you log in using the admin user. If you use a different user, only the hostname is shown. The hostname is the name configured for the management interface. For example,
admin@firepower:~$
FXOS CLI
With the exception of the ASA hardware models, FXOS is the operating system that controls the overall chassis. Depending on the model, you use FXOS for configuration and troubleshooting. From FXOS, you can enter the threat defense CLI using the connect command.
For all appliance-mode models (models other than the Firepower 4100/9300), you can go from the threat defense CLI to the FXOS CLI using the connect fxos command.
The FXOS command prompt looks like the following, but the prompt changes based on mode. See FXOS documentation for details about FXOS CLI usage.

Syntax Formatting
Command syntax descriptions use the following conventions:
Convention
Description
command
Command text indicates commands and keywords that you enter literally as shown.
variable
Variable text indicates arguments for which you supply values.
[x]
Square brackets enclose an optional element (keyword or argument).
[ x | y]
Square brackets enclosing keywords or arguments separated by a vertical bar indicate an optional choice.
{x | y}
Braces enclosing keywords or arguments separated by a vertical bar indicate a required choice.
[x {y | z}]
Nested sets of square brackets or braces indicate optional or required choices within optional or required elements. Braces and a vertical bar within square brackets indicate a required choice within an optional element.
Entering Commands
When you log into the CLI through the console port or an SSH session, you are presented with the following command prompt:
>
You type the command at the prompt and press Enter to execute the command. Additional features include:
Scrolling through command history—You can use the up and down arrow keys to scroll through the commands that you have already entered. You can reenter or edit and reenter the commands in the history.
Completing commands—To complete a command or keyword after entering a partial string, press the space or Tab key. The partial string must match a single command or keyword only for it to be completed.
Abbreviating commands—In the regular CLI, you cannot abbreviate commands. You must enter the full command string. However, in the diagnostic CLI, you can abbreviate most commands down to the fewest unique characters for a command; for example, you can enter show ver instead of show version .
Stopping command output—If a command produces a lot of output, you can get out of it by pressing the q key.
Stopping long-running commands—If a command is not returning output fast enough, and you want to try a different command, press Ctrl+C.
Filtering Show Command Output
You can filter the output of show commands by piping the output to filtering commands. Piping output works with all show commands but is most useful when dealing with commands that produce a lot of text.
To use the filtering capabilities, use the following format. In this case, the vertical bar | after the show command is the pipe character and is part of the command, not part of the syntax description. The filtering options come after the | character.
show command | {grep | include | exclude | begin} regular expression
Filtering Commands
You can use these filtering commands:
grep —Display only those lines that match the pattern.
include —Display only those lines that match the pattern.
exclude —Exclude all lines that match the pattern, show all other lines.
begin —Find the first line that includes the pattern, and display that line and all subsequent lines.
regular_expression
A regular expression, typically a simple text string. Do not enclose the expression in single or double-quotes, these will be seen as part of the expression. Also, trailing spaces will be included in the expression.
The following example shows how to change the output of the show access-list command to show only those rules that apply to the inside1_2 interface.
