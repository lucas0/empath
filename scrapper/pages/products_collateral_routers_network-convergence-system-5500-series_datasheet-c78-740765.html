Product overview
Based on the Cisco® Global Cloud Index, digitalization is projected to grow global data center and public/private cloud network traffic more than 25 percent annually, resulting in a threefold increase by 2019. To help network providers meet these challenges, the Cisco Network Convergence System 5500 Series is built with features such as extremely high port densities, deep packet buffering, and forwarding hardware optimized for these types of deployments.
The Cisco NCS 5500 Series provides a wide variety of combo line cards and chassis to address the customer’s need to use flexible interfaces and port densities along with full bandwidth utilization of forwarding Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). The Cisco NCS 5500 Series also offers high scaled line card and fixed chassis, which improves Forwarding Information Base (FIB) scale capabilities 8 times or more when compared with the base version of the line card. These line cards are capable of advanced packet forwarding, segment routing, programmable network management, and telemetry along with the robust and mature features already present in 64-bit Cisco IOS® XR Software.
The Cisco NCS 5500 Series software feature licenses are designed to map to specific use cases for their network that have discernible value. The feature sets that differentiate these use cases are notated by command references throughout this document. As new features are added to Cisco IOS XR, they will be specifically added to feature licenses as applicable. Cisco also has given customers the flexibility to purchase as they desire based on their budget situation, using either one initial payment covering all the possible features and capacity that might be required during the product deployment or a pay-as-you-go approach that enables customers to minimize their initial costs and only pay for features and capacity as they use them. The NCS 5500 Series has both software feature licenses and hardware port enablement/bandwidth enablement licenses. This document covers the software feature licenses and the main feature areas they cover. Figure 1 shows NCS-5500 family of products.

License usage examples
Table 2.        Software license usage/quantity examples
All NCS 5500 licenses are smart license based. There are no PAK licenses.
Type
Example
Bandwidth-based license
License ending in 100T, 100S, 50T, or 50S
●  Example 1: If two ports are inserted with 40G optics, only one 100T or 100S license is needed.
●  Example 2: If 5 x 40G ports are being used, only 2 x 100T or 100S licenses are needed.
●  Example 3: If one 50T or 50S license was purchased, users can use the software features on 1 x 40G port and 1 x 10G port or 5 x 10G ports.
●  Example 4: If one 50T or 50S license was originally purchased for use with a 40G optic but this was later updated it to a 100G optic, then an additional 50T or 50S license will need to be purchased.
Upgradable modular line cards
Licenses for modular line cards:
NC55-36X100G-U-BA, NC55-18H18F-BA, NC55-24H12F-SB
●  Example 1: If NC55-18H18F-BA is used and features need to be applied to all 36 ports running at 40G, then either:
◦  One license in each feature area of use ending in 1818T is needed for the entire line card.
◦  Or an equivalent number 50T bandwidth license is needed (29 in this example).
●  Example 2: If NC55-18H18F-BA is used and 10 of the maximum 18 ports were upgraded to 100G via hardware upgrade license (hardware license not described in this document) and features need to be applied to all 36 ports, which include 26 x 40G ports and 10 x 100G ports, either:
◦  One license in each feature area of use ending in 1818T plus 10 x 50T license for the 10 upgraded ports is needed.
◦  Or an equivalent number 50T bandwidth license is needed (41 in this example).
●  Example 3: If NC55-24H12F-SB is used and features need to be applied to all 36 ports running at 40G, then either:
◦  One license in each feature area of use ending in 2412S is needed.

●  Example 4: If NC55-24H12F-SB is used and 24 of the maximum 24 ports were upgraded to 100G via hardware upgrade license (hardware license not described in this document) and features need to be applied to all 36 ports, which include 12 x 40G ports and 24 x 100G ports, then either:
◦  One license in each feature area of use ending in 2412S plus 24 x 50S license for the 24 upgraded ports is needed.
◦  Or an equivalent number 50S bandwidth license is needed (58 in this example).
●  Example 5: If NC55-36X100G-U-BA is used and features need to be applied to all 36 ports running at 40G, then either:
◦  One license in each feature area of use ending in 36HTU is needed.
◦  Or an equivalent number 50T bandwidth license is needed (29 in this example).
●  Example 6: If NC55-36X100G-U-BA is used and 36 of the maximum 36 ports were upgraded to 100G via hardware upgrade license (hardware license not described in this document) and features need to be applied to all 36 ports, which include 36 x 100G ports, then either:
◦  Two licenses in each feature area of use ending in 36HTU.
◦  Or one license in each feature area of use ending in 36HTU plus 36 x 50T license for the 36 upgraded ports is needed.
◦  Or an equivalent number 50T bandwidth license is needed (72 in this example).
Upgradable fixed chassis
Licenses for fixed chassis:
NCS-5501-U,
NCS-5501-U-SE,
NCS-5502-U40,
NCS-5502-U40-SE,
NCS-5502-U100,
NCS-5502-U100-SE.
●  Example 1: If the NCS-5501-U is used and features need to be applied to the base level (no additional HW ports activated), then only the license ending in 5501TU is needed.
●  Example 2: If the NCS-5501-U is used and additional ports are added via hardware license (not described in this document), then there needs to be one 5501TX license for each HW license added.
●  Example 3: If the NCS-5502-U40 or U100 is used and features need to be applied to the base level (no additional HW ports activated), then only the license ending in 5502TU is needed.
●  Example 4: If the NCS-5502-U40 or U100 is used and additional ports are added via hardware license (not described in this document), then there needs to be one 5502TX license for each HW license added.
Nonupgradable modular line cards or fixed chassis
Licenses not listed earlier and are not system or bundled licenses
●  Example 1: If NC55-36X100G-BA is used and features need to be applied to all 36 ports running at 100G, then either:
◦  One license in each feature area of use ending in 36HT is needed for the entire line card.
◦  Or an equivalent number 100T bandwidth license is needed (36 in this example).
●  Example 2: If NC55-36X100G-BA is used and features need to be applied to all 36 ports running at but 10 are with 40G optics and 26 are with 100G, then either:
◦  One license in each feature area of use ending in 36HT is needed for the entire line card.
◦  Or an equivalent number 100T bandwidth license is needed (30 in this example).
System license
License includes:
NC55P-TIMING-F and NC55P-TIMING-M
●  Example 1: If a modular chassis is used and NC55-RP-E is required along with timing-capable line cards, then only one NC55P-TIMING-M license is need for the entire chassis.
●  Example 2: If a fixed chassis is used with timing ports, then only one NC55P-TIMING-F license is need for the entire chassis.
MACsec license
License includes: NC55P-MSEC-36HT,
NC55P-MSEC-6DWMT,
NC55P-MSEC-100T, and NC55P-MSEC-50T
●  Example 1: If NC55-36X100G-BM is used and MACsec features need to be applied to all 36 ports running at 100G, then either:
◦  One MACsec license ending in 36HT is needed for the entire line card.
◦  Or an equivalent number 100T bandwidth license is needed (36 in this example).
●  Example 2: If NC55-6X2H-DWDM-BM is used and MACsec features need to be applied to all 6 ports running at 150G mode, then:
◦  One MACsec license ending in 6DWMT is needed for the entire line card, but this is a bit overkill as it is priced at a 6 x 200G level. But it is useful if you don’t want to go back to buy additional licenses as your MACsec bandwidth grows.
◦  Or an equivalent number 50T bandwidth licenses is needed (18 in this example).
●  Example 3: If NCS-55A1-36H-B is used and MACsec features need to be applied to all 10 ports running at 100G, then:
◦  One MACsec license of ending in 36HT is needed for the entire line card, but this is a bit overkill as it is priced at a 36 x 100G level. But it is useful if you don’t want to go back to buy additional license as your MACsec bandwidth grows.
◦  Or an equivalent number 100T bandwidth licenses is needed (10 in this example).
Bundled licenses
License includes NC55P licenses with BDL or BNDL in the middle of the PID name
●  Example 1: On the per port (bandwidth) bundled license like those ending in BDL-100T, each bundled license contains a bundle of 4 x licenses:
◦  ADVL3-100T
◦  ADVL2-100T
◦  CRAGR-100T
◦  PEER-100T
◦  ADVDC-100T is NOT included but implied because it’s a subset of CRAGR.
●  Example 2: On the per fixed chassis or line card bundled license like those with BDL middle but ending in something other than 100T, 100S, 50T and 50S, each bundled license contains a bundle of 4 x licenses (we will use NC55P-BDL-36HT in this example):
◦  ADVL3-36HT
◦  ADVL2-36HT
◦  CRAGR-36HT
◦  PEER-36HT
◦  ADVDC-36HT is NOT included but implied because it’s a subset of CRAGR.
