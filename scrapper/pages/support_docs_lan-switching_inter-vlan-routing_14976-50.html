Introduction
This document describes how to configure the configurations to set up Inter VLAN routing with the use of an external Cisco router.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of this topics:
Basic Routing knowledge.
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
Catalyst 3512XL switch that runs Cisco IOS 12.0(5.x)XU
Cisco 2621 router that runs Cisco IOS 12.1(3)T
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Conventions
For more information on document conventions, refer to the Cisco Technical Tips Conventions.
Background Information
This document describes the configurations to setup Inter-VLAN routing with the use of an external Cisco routers and explains it with sample configurations on 802.1Q trunking between a Catalyst 3500-XL switch and a Cisco 2600 router; the results of each command are displayed as they are executed. Cisco 3600 or other members of the Cisco 2600 series routers, with FastEthernet interfaces, and any Catalyst switch can be used in the scenarios presented in this document to obtain the same results.
Trunking is a way to carry traffic from several VLANs over a point-to-point link between the two devices. Initially, there were two ways in which Ethernet trunking was implemented:
InterSwitch Link (ISL) Cisco proprietary protocol.
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.1Q standard.
A trunk link is created and used to carry traffic from two or more VLANs, for example, VLAN1 and VLAN2 across a single link between Catalyst switches and/or a Cisco router.
The Cisco router is used to do the Inter-VLAN routing between VLAN-X and VLAN-Y, this configuration can be useful when the Catalyst series switches are Layer 2 (L2) only and cannot route or communicate between the VLANs (such as 2900XL/3500XL/2940/2950/2970).
To create the examples in this document, the next switches in a lab environment were used with cleared configurations:
Catalyst 3512XL switch that runs Cisco IOS 12.0(5.x)XU
Cisco 2621 router that runs Cisco IOS 12.1(3)T
For Catalyst 2900XL/3500XL/2940/2950/2970 Switches:
Refer to Table 1 for a sample list of switch models that support trunking:

Note: Only registered Cisco users have access to internal documents, tools, and information.
Note: In Catalyst 2900XL/3500XL/2940/2950/2970 switches, a VLAN interface, for example, int vlan 1, int vlan 2, and int vlan x can be created for each and every VLAN that is configured on the switch. However, only one VLAN can be used at a time as a management VLAN. The IP address is assigned to the VLAN interface of the management VLAN only. If the IP address is assigned to another VLAN interface whose VLAN is not used as management VLAN, that interface cannot come up. It is preferred to create the VLAN interface only for the management VLAN.
For Cisco 2600 Routers
For 802.1Q trunking, one VLAN is not tagged. This VLAN is called native VLAN. The native VLAN is used for untagged traffic when the port is in 802.1Q trunking mode. While you configure 802.1Q trunking, remember that the native VLAN must be configured the same on each side of the trunk link. It is a common mistake not to match the native VLANs when 802.1Q trunking between the router and the switch is configured.
In this sample configuration, the native VLAN is VLAN1, by default, on both the Cisco router and the Catalyst switch. Dependent on your network needs, you can have to use a native VLAN other than the default VLAN, VLAN1. Commands have been mentioned in the  Configurations section of this document on how to change the native VLAN on these devices.
Sample configurations presented in this document can be used on Cisco 2600/3600 and other series routers with Fast Ethernet interfaces or higher. Also, ensure that you use the Cisco IOS version that supports 802.1Q VLAN trunking. For a sample list of Cisco 2600/3600 routers that support 802.1Q VLAN trunking and the supported Cisco IOS versions, refer to Table 2.

!-- Set the VTP Mode. In our example, we have set the mode to be transparent. 
!-- Depending on your network, set the VTP Mode accordingly. 

3512xl#vlan database
3512xl(vlan)#vtp transparent
Setting device to VTP TRANSPARENT mode.
!-- Adding VLAN2. VLAN1 already exists by default.

3512xl(vlan)#vlan 2
VLAN 2 added:
Name: VLAN0002
3512xl(vlan)#exit
APPLY completed.
Exiting....


!-- Enable trunking on the interface fastEthernet 0/1.
!-- Enter the trunking encapsulation as either as dot1q.

3512xl#configure terminal 
Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z. 
3512xl(config)#interface fastEthernet 0/1 
3512xl(config-if)#switchport mode trunk 
3512xl(config-if)#switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q  

!-- In case of 2940/2950 series switches, none of the above two commands are used, 
!-- 2940/2950 series switches only support 802.1q encapsulation which is configured automatically, 
!-- when trunking is enabled on the interface by using switchport mode trunk command. 
!-- In case of dot1q, you need to make sure that the native VLAN matches across the link. 

!-- On Catalyst Switches, by default, the native VLAN is 1. 
!-- It is very important that you change the native VLAN on the router accordingly. 
!-- You may change the native VLAN, if needed, by using the following command: 
!-- 3512xl(config-if)#switchport trunk native vlan <vlan ID> 

!-- Allow all VLANs on the trunk.
 
3512xl(config-if)#switchport trunk allowed vlan all 
3512xl(config-if)#exit 

!-- The following set of commands can place FastEthernet 0/2 into VLAN2.  

3512xl(config)#interface fastEthernet 0/2 
3512xl(config-if)#switchport mode access 
3512xl(config-if)#switchport access vlan 2 
3512xl(config-if)#exit 

!-- FastEthernet 0/3 is already in VLAN1 by default.  

3512xl(config)#interface fastEthernet 0/3

Debug and Show Commands
This section helps you confirm that your configuration works as expected.
On the Catalyst switch, you can use the next commands to help with the verification:
show interface {FastEthernet | GigabitEthernet} <module/port> switchport
show vlan
show vtp status
On the Cisco 2600 router, use the next commands:
show ip route
show interface
Sample show Command Output
Catalyst Switch
show int {FastEthernet | GigabitEthernet} <module/port> switchport
This command is used to check the administrative and operational status of the port. It is also used to make sure that the native VLAN matches on both sides of the trunk. The native VLAN is used for untagged traffic when the port is in 802.1Q trunking mode.
For 802.1Q trunking, the output command shows:
3512xl#show int fastEthernet 0/1 switchport
Name: Fa0/1
Switchport: Enabled
Administrative mode: trunk
Operational Mode: trunk
Administrative Trunking Encapsulation: dot1q
Operational Trunking Encapsulation: dot1q
Negotiation of Trunking: Disabled
Access Mode VLAN: 0 ((Inactive))
Trunking Native Mode VLAN: 1 (default)
Trunking VLANs Enabled: ALL
Trunking VLANs Active: 1,2
Pruning VLANs Enabled: 2-1001

Priority for untagged frames: 0
Override vlan tag priority: FALSE
Voice VLAN: none
show vlan
This command is used to verify that the interfaces (ports) belong to the correct VLAN. In this example, only interface Fa0/2 belongs to VLAN2. The rest are members of VLAN1.
3512xl#show vlan
VLAN Name                             Status    Ports
