Prerequisites for Using the Software Upgrade Workflow
Ensure that the Cisco devices are running the required software versions for using the software upgrade workflow feature. For the respective device requirements, see Supported Devices for the Software Upgrade Workflow.
Access the Software Upgrade Workflow
Before You Begin
To check if there is an in-progress software upgrade workflow:
From the Cisco vManage toolbar, click the Task-list icon. Cisco vManage displays a list of all running tasks along with the total number of successes and failures.
Access the Software Upgrade Workflow
In the Cisco vManage menu, click Workflows > Workflow Library.

Note
In the Cisco vManage Release 20.8.1, the Workflow Library is titled Launch Workflows.
Start a new software upgrade workflow: Library > Software Upgrade.
OR
Alternatively, resume an in-progress software upgrade workflow: In-progress > Software Upgrade.
Follow the on-screen instructions to start a new software upgrade workflow.

Note
Click Exit to exit from an in-progress software upgrade workflow. You can resume the in-progress workflow at your convenience.

Note
In a multi-node cluster setup, if the control connection switches to a different node during a device upgrade from Cisco vManage, the upgrade may be impacted due to NetConf session timeout. The device then establishes control connection to a different node. You need to re-trigger the upgrade activity.
Verify the Status of the Software Upgrade Workflow
To check the software upgrade workflow status:
From the Cisco vManage toolbar, click the Task-list icon.
Cisco vManage displays a list of all running tasks along with the total number of successes and failures.
Click the + icon to view the details of a task.
Cisco vManage opens a pane displaying the status of the task and details of the device on which the task was performed.
Schedule Software Upgrade Workflow
Introduced in Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1, the scheduler in the software upgrade workflow enables you to schedule workflows at your convenience and avoid any downtime due to the software upgrade process. A scheduler enables you to schedule the upgrade workflow either Now or Later. If you choose to schedule an upgrade for a later time, you can enter the Start Date, Start time, and Select Timezone.
Schedule Software Upgrade Workflow
Use the following steps to schedule a software upgrade workflow:
In the Cisco vManage menu, click Workflows > Workflow Library
OR
Starting from Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1, click Workflows > Popular Workflows > Software Upgrade..
Start a new software upgrade workflow: Workflow Library > Software Upgrade.
OR
Alternatively, resume an in-progress software upgrade workflow: In-progress > Software Upgrade.
In the Scheduler section, choose Later.

Note
Use the Now option to perform the software upgrade for the selected devices immediately.
Choose the Start Date, Start Time, and Select Timezone.

Note
Start date and time should always be greater than the Cisco vManage server date and time.
Click Next.
The software upgrade workflow is scheduled.
Cancel the Scheduled Software Upgrade Workflow
To cancel a scheduled software upgrade workflow,
From the Cisco vManage menu, click Maintenance > Software Upgrade.
Choose the device that is scheduled for a software upgrade from the list of devices.
Click Cancel Software Upgrade.
