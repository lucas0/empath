Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine 5.0 Release Notes
This document provides information about Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine, including product overview, new features and functionality, compatibility information, and known issues and limitations.
Overview
Network operators are facing challenges to support the exponential growth of network traffic while addressing the pressure to efficiently run network operations. They need a toolset to help automate bandwidth optimization and efficiently steer traffic with little operator intervention. Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine fulfills this need by providing real-time network optimization capabilities that allow operators to effectively maximize network utility as well as increase service velocity.
Looking at the following figure, Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine is built to fulfill the need for a closed-loop optimization loop as described under “Near Real-Time Feedback Loop”. Through Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine, the operator is able to define the optimization intent, implement the intent, and continuously monitor, track, and react to maintain the original intent.
Figure 1. Network Resolution Lifecycle
Real-time Visibility
To run their network effectively, end-to-end visibility is important to any network operator. Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine not only provides this visibility, but also the ability to visualize the network across different layers and the relationship between each layer. Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine leverages IETF-standard BGP-LS protocol to discover IP network automatically, including the following features:
Real-time visibility: Provides the network operator with a true representation of the actual topology
Hierarchical topology view: Enables operators to define the different levels of granularity in the topology visualization
Simplified SR-TE Policy and RSVP-TE Tunnel Lifecycle Management
Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine also provides an easy to use UI and API to manage and monitor the TE tunnel lifecycle. The UI and API enables the network operator to perform the following tasks:
Visualize SR-TE (SR-MPLS and SRv6) policies and RSVP-TE tunnels.
Create, modify, and remove SR-MPLS policies and RSVP-TE tunnels using an intuitive workflow
Continuously track SR-MPLS policies and RSVP-TE tunnels and use dynamic path computations to maintain SLA objectives
Preview an SR-MPLS policy or RSVP-TE tunnel before deploying it to the network
Extensibility through Feature Packs
Crosswork Optimization Engine feature packs to help tackle bandwidth management, network congestions, and prevent over capacity utilization. A user defines the bandwidth optimization intent and the tools implement the intent, and continuously monitor, track, and react to maintain the original intent. A user can also define network congestion thresholds and configure whether to have the tool automatically remediate congestion or provide mitigation suggestions the operator can choose to act upon.
Due to licensing or the configuration of the role associated with your user account, you may not be able to access all of the features and functions. For licensing and ordering information, work with your Cisco Partner or Cisco Sales representative.
What's New
This section lists new features and changes delivered in Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine 5.0. For system requirements information, see the Cisco Crosswork Network Controller 5.0 Installation Guide.
Table 1. New Features and Functionality in Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine 5.0
Feature
What's New?
SR Circuit Style Manager (CSM)
CSM is a new feature pack that provides a bandwidth-aware Path Computation Element (PCE) to compute Circuit Style SR-TE policy paths that you can visualize in your network. Circuit Style enables segment routed transport tailored for circuit-oriented services over a packet based network through the use of bi-directional, co-routed, path protected SR-TE policies. Circuit Style SR-TE policies are typically used for high priority services, such as crucial monetary transactions or important live video feed, which require committed bandwidth with fast and fail-safe connections. CSM ensures dynamic Circuit Style SR-TE policies are provisioned along paths that meet strict bandwidth requirements while at the same time respecting any additional user configured constraints such as latency minimization and disjointness.
Centralized bandwidth accounting in the CSM feature pack allows the user to monitor resource reservation levels and quickly identify hot spots where available bandwidth in the circuit style bandwidth pool is low. The ability to visualize Circuit Style SR-TE policies in your network topology enables easy verification of Circuit Style SR-TE policy configurations, details, and path states. With a few clicks you can view Active and Protect paths, operational status, reserved bandwidth pool size and monitor path failover behavior for individual Circuit Style SR-TE policies.
Segment Routing Tree Segment Identifier (Tree-SID)
In addition to being able to visualize Tree-SID policies, you now have the ability to provision static Tree-SID policies in the UI (Traffic Engineering or Services & Traffic Engineering > Tree-SID tab > Create).
Note
  If there are any PCEs running Cisco IOS versions that are not supported in the network, Tree-SID visualization will not work. To view Cisco IOS versions that are supported in this release, see Compatibility Information.
Traffic Engineering Dashboard
In the Policies and Tunnels Under Traffic Threshold Range dashlet (Traffic Engineering or Services & Traffic Engineering > TE Dashboard), you can now define a traffic threshold range with a minimum and maximum value.
On certain dashlets in the TE Dashboard there is a new 1H time range and a new calendar icon. You can use the new calendar icon to set a date and time range.


Home Dashboard
Ability to add or remove TE dashlets.
SRv6
You can now visualize PCC-initiated SRv6 explicit policies including the segment list information.
IPv4 Unnumbered Interface
IPv4 unnumbered interfaces allow you to enable IP processing on a serial interface without assigning it an explicit IP address. The IP unnumbered interface can "borrow" the IP address of another interface already configured on the router, which conserves network and address space.
IPv4 unnumbered interface information (when available) is now displayed as either an index or a combination of the TE Router ID and the index in device, link, and topology details. For example:


You can also view unnumbered interface information in the segment list of SR Policy Candidate Path information.
UI and Topology
Multiple UI and topology map updates have been made, including the following:
You can now search within the topology map. This feature allows you to quickly locate devices based on the following criteria:
Civic Location (for example, San Jose)
Host/Device name (for example, NAT-01)
IP address (for example, 121.10.10.1.1)
Import and Export geographical objects using Keyhole Markup Language (KML) format:
Using the Crosswork Network Controller UI, you can import and export KML files to exam, change, or add device geographical information and see the updates in the UI map. For example, you may use the export function to download your device’s data in KML format to your system, exam and/or change the device details, and upload it into a map generator (such as Google Maps) to view your updated device information and coordinates outside of Crosswork Network Controller. You can then use the import function to upload the updated, or browse for a new, KML file back into Crosswork Network Controller. If changes were made, they will now appear in the geographical map after it refreshes. When using the import function, Crosswork Network Controller also provides a sample KML template. The sample KML template provides information on where to identify devices and their coordinates, an optional device name, and the IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of a device with corresponding coordinates. This template can be used on your system before importing back into Crosswork Network Controller.
Enhanced L2 link information:
The Link Type text in the Link Details Summary page now indicates discovery method: L2 Ethernet (CDP) or L2 Ethernet (LLDP). Link discovery can be configured in Administration > System Settings tab > Topology: Discovery.
Utilization information (virtual interfaces display rate only)
Updated utilization tooltip
The Dashboard now includes Circuit Style, Hop Count, and an Unknown category details
A History view has been added to the Traffic Engineering page
Two new columns are added to the Link Details table: Delay and Jitter
New search icon added in the topology screen
Enhanced device group feature
New import and export feature using KML format is added in the topology screen
Various table enhancements (inline buttons, borders, hover states, show/hide columns, and so on)
Enhanced filtering in columns and added a check box in drop-down popovers to allow multiple selections
Updated titles for consistency for parameters, pages, and menus
Bandwidth Optimization
This feature pack has been removed.
Alarms and Events
New and updated alarms and events for the following:
Tree-SID policy state and path changes.
Several topology changes (for example: ISIS or OSPF link down, LLDP or CDP link down, node deletion, duplicate IP address detection, and so on)
Changes in LSP operational states (for example: state down, deleted, and updated)
Ability to track and clear alarms.
IP source address logs
The source IP addresses can now be captured in audit log files (Administration > AAA > Settings > Source IP). Captures the last source IP address that initiated an operation. For more information on audit logs, see the See the "Manage System Health" chapter (under Collect Audit Information) in the Cisco Crosswork Network Controller 5.0 Administration Guide.

Upgrade Crosswork Optimization Engine Feature Packs
If you have enabled feature packs (LCM or BWoD) in Crosswork Optimization Engine 4.1 and want to upgrade to Crosswork Optimization Engine 5.0, you must perform the following tasks prior to upgrading:
LCM
From the LCM Configuration page:
Set the Delete Tactical SR Policies when Disabled option to False. This task must be done prior to disabling LCM so that tactical polices deployed by LCM remain in the network after the upgrade.
Set the Enable option to False. If LCM remains enabled, there is a chance that tactical policies may be deleted after the upgrade.
Note all options (Basic and Advanced) in the LCM Configuration page so that you can confirm the same configuration has been migrated after the upgrade.
Export the current list of interfaces managed by LCM (Traffic Engineering > Local Congestion Mitigation > Export icon). Confirm the interfaces are valid by reimporting the CSV file without errors. For more information, see "Add Individual Interface Thresholds" in the Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine 5.0 User Guide.
After the upgrade, wait until the Traffic Engineering page shows all the nodes and links before enabling LCM
Note:
After the system is stable and before enabling domains for LCM, confirm that the migration of previously monitored interfaces has completed and that each domain has the expected configuration options.
Navigate to Administration > Alarms > All > Events and enter LCM to filter the Source column.
Look for the following event: "Migration complete. All migrated LCM interfaces and policies are mapped to their IGP domains". If this message does not appear wait for the Congestion Check Interval period (set in the LCM Configuration page), then restart LCM (Administration > Crosswork Manager > Optimization Engine > optima-lcm > ... > Restart).
Wait until the optima-lcm service changes from Degraded to Healthy state.
For each domain, navigate to the Configuration page and verify the options have been migrated successfully. If the domain configurations are incorrect, restart LCM (Administration > Crosswork Manager > Optimization Engine > optima-lcm > ... > Restart).
Check the Events page for the event mentioned above and the Configuration page to verify the options.

Note
If the confirmation message does not appear or domain configuration options are incorrect, then contact Cisco Technical support and provide them with showtech information and the exported Link Management CSV file.
You can also manually add missing interfaces that were previously monitored or update domain configuration options after the system is stable.
BWoD
Set the Enable option to False. If BWoD remains enabled, there is a chance that tactical policies may be deleted after the upgrade.
Note all options (Basic and Advanced) in the BWoD Configuration page so that you can confirm the same configuration has been migrated after the upgrade.
After the upgrade, wait until the Traffic Engineering page shows all the nodes and links before enabling BWoD.

On Cisco 8000 Series Routers, only static Tree-SID policies with leaf role are supported.
The RestConf API is not supported.
Tree-SID policy details do not show IPv6 router ID or SRv6 core information.
SR-MPLS
In the SR-MPLS provisioning screen and while previewing an SR-MPLS policy with an IPv6 address, a parsing error is displayed instead of correct error message: "Request Failed. Endpoint address is IPv6, IPv6 provisioning is not supported yet."
Updating the SID constraint on an existing policy is not allowed by the SR-PCE. The modification screen gives a successful update message, instead of a warning message that it is not allowed.
APIs
The Topology API cannot discover and report IPv6 Link-Local style links.
The Dashboard Export API cannot export CSV files to an external location. It can only export to /mnt/cw_glusterfs/bricks/rscoean/export.
BWoD
BWoD gets disabled when SR Policy Traffic field has 'Measured' selected and Policy Violation field has 'Strict Network' selected.
