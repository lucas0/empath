Introduction
The article describes a process of converting a fulfilled product activation key (PAK) to a Smart License for Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Firepower.
Caution: You should only convert a product activation key (PAK) to a Smart License for ASA products that are running Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) software. To identify whether your license can be converted or not, refer to Cisco Firepower System Feature Licenses. For more information about Firepower Licensing, refer to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about Firepower Licensing.
Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure that:
You have the following data at your disposal:
Active Cisco.com account
Administrator or User access to a Smart Account (To request Administrator or User access to a Smart account, refer to How to Request Access to an Existing Smart Account.)
Your PAK is assigned to your Smart Account.
How to Convert a Fulfilled PAK to a Smart License for ASA Firepower
Step 1: 
Go to Cisco Software Central and log in with your Cisco.com account.
Step 2:
In the Traditional Licenses section, click Access LRP.
Step 3:
In the Show Smart Account and Virtual Account drop-down lists, confirm that the correct respective accounts are selected.
Note: If the system displays the Welcome To The License Registration Portal alert dialog box, you can select Do not show this message again to prevent it from being displayed again.
(Optional) Step 4:
Note: If you already have the license key of your device at your disposal, you can skip to step 6.
On the PAKs or Tokens tab, select a product activation key (PAK) with the Fulfilled status that you want to convert to a Smart license. Click the blue circled chevron icon and select Get PAK or Token information.
Note: Notice that when you click the blue circled chevron icon, the Convert to Smart Licensing option is not available from here.
(Optional) Step 5:
In the PAK/Token dialog box, click the Devices tab, and then copy the License Key. Close the dialog box.
Note: If the product activation key (PAK) has the Fulfilled Status and the Devices tab does not display any device information, you need to open a case in Support Case Manager (SCM) to have the product activation key (PAK) converted to a Smart License.
Step 6:
Click the Devices tab, press Ctrl+F, paste the License Key in the find box, and then press Enter. The system highlights the License Key of the device to which the license from the fulfilled product activation key (PAK) is assigned to.
Step 7:
Select the check box next to the device, click the blue circled chevron icon, and then select Convert Licenses to Smart Licensing.
Step 8:
In the Select Product Family dialog box, from the Product Family drop-down list, select the product family that is compatible with your license. Click Next.
Note: In the Firepower Perpetual Family, the Control & Protect Licenses are not convertible, as they are built into Smart Licensing.
Step 9:
In the Convert to Smart Entitlements dialog box, select your Virtual Account from the drop-down list, select the check box next to the stock keeping unit (SKU), and then click Submit.
Note: If more than one product activation keys (PAKs) are associated with the device, then you can select some or all licenses to be converted in the Convert to Smart Entitlements dialog box.
Step 10:
When the system displays the License Request Status dialog box with the message about successful conversion, note down the Transaction ID (you will need the Transaction ID in the Next Steps section). Click Close.
Note: Once you convert the fulfilled product activation key (PAK) to a Smart License, the device that the traditional license was assigned to disappears from the list of devices.
Note: If you experience any issue with converting to Smart License, refer to the Troubleshooting section of this article.
