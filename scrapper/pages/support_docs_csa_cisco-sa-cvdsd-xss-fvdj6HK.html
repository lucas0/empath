Summary
A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface on an affected device.
This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
