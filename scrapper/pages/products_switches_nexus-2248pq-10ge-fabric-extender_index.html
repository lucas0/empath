Cost Effective Access Layer, 40 GE Connectivity

The combination of the Cisco Nexus 2248PQ and upstream Cisco Nexus 5000 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 6000 Series Switches provides a cost-effective access layer and scalable strategy for 10 GE and FCoE at the server access layer. It also helps to enable a smooth migration to a 40 GE network fabric.
