Eliminating language barriers
In the US 1 in 4 children are born to immigrant families. Non-English speaking parents lack understanding and support to help their children, while teachers lack the tools to effectively communicate with these parents. Here’s how TalkingPoints helps:
TalkingPoints is a multilingual, family engagement platform with two-way translation and coaching that promotes family engagement and drives learning outcomes.
The technology empowers teachers and parents to build strong partnerships, change mindsets and increase their capacity to support students.
Since 2015, Talking Points has supported family engagement and teacher-family connections—reaching 4.5M students, parents and teachers, with over 200 million conversations facilitated between families and educators to date.
89% of schools served by TalkingPoints are Title I eligible.

Thanks to Cisco's support, we tripled our reach in a single quarter, serving millions of families this year to stay connected and informed about their children's learning through expanding TalkingPoints' organizational infrastructure in every direction.”
