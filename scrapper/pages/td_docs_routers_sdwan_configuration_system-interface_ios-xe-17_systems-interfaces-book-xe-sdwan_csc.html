Cisco SD-WAN Support for Carrier Supporting Carrier Connectivity
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1
The feature adds support for carrier supporting carrier (CSC) connectivity on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
CSC enables you to interconnect IP or multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) networks operating at different sites over an MPLS backbone network. Using CSC requires an edge router that supports CSC functionality, called a carrier edge (CE) device, at each site. This feature enables a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device to serve as a CE device, making it unnecessary to have a separate dedicated CE device at each site managed by Cisco SD-WAN.

Information About Cisco SD-WAN Carrier Supporting Carrier
Carrier Supporting Carrier
Carrier supporting carrier (CSC) is a hierarchical VPN model that allows organizations to interconnect their IP or MPLS networks located at different sites over an MPLS backbone network. This eliminates the need for the organizations to build and maintain their own MPLS backbone.
The following are components of CSC:
Backbone carrier: The service provider that provides the backbone network. Typically, the backbone carrier network employs multiple segments to segregate the traffic of different customer carriers that share the backbone carrier network. The backbone carrier may be managed by the same organization or by a different organization as the customer carriers.
Customer carrier: An organization that uses the backbone network to route traffic from one site to another. The customer carrier may be part of the organization that operates the backbone network, or may be independent.
CSC-CE: Customer edge (CE) device. This device operates within a local site network and connects the site to the backbone carrier, using an MPLS connection. It utilizes the backbone carrier to connect to other sites.
CSC-PE: Provider edge (PE) device. This device operates within the backbone carrier network and connects to CSC-CE devices at customer sites, using an MPLS connection.

The following illustration shows a CSC network topology with a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device at each site, using a release earlier than Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a. Because the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices cannot function as a CSC-CE when using these releases, the topology requries two separate devices at each site: an edge device managed by Cisco SD-WAN and a separate CSC-CE device.
Figure 1. Carrier Supporting Carrier with Cisco SD-WAN, Before Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a
From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a, a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device can serve as a CSC-CE device, making it unnecessary to have a separate dedicated CSC-CE device. As compared with the previous illustration, the following illustration shows a simpler CSC network topology, with Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices providing CSC-CE functionality.

Traffic Flow
If a CSC-CE device only has an MPLS connection to the neighbor CSC-PE device, then all traffic from the CSC-CE device uses the MPLS connection, including the following traffic types:
Service VPN traffic
Control traffic
Cisco SD-WAN bidirectional forwarding detection (BFD) probe traffic
If a CSC-CE device has an MPLS connection to the neighbor CSC-PE device and also has a separate connection to the internet, then the traffic from the CSC-CE device may use different connections, as follows:
Based on the configured traffic policy, control traffic and BFD probe traffic can use the internet and MPLS connections.
Service VPN traffic uses only the MPLS connection.
Label Switching
For traffic that uses an MPLS connection between a CSC device and the backbone carrier, the backbone carrier manages the traffic using label-switched paths, and has no information about the customer carrier routes.
Benefits of Cisco SD-WAN Carrier Supporting Carrier
Cisco SD-WAN support for CSC enables a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device to serve as an edge device at a site where CSC is required. With the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device providing CSC-CE functionality, it is not necessary to have a separate router serving the CE role.
Use Cases for Cisco SD-WAN Carrier Supporting Carrier
Cisco SD-WAN support for CSC is useful for global organizations that use CSC with a backbone carrier to support multiple, separate divisions of the organization. Each division's traffic is private but shares a common backbone carrier.
Service providers that use a CSC topology may benefit from Cisco SD-WAN support for CSC. Carrier edge devices managed by Cisco SD-WAN can support CSC, making it unnecessary to have a separate device to manage CSC functionality.
Configure Carrier Supporting Carrier
You can configure the CE devices for CSC in the following ways:
(Recommended) In Cisco vManage, use a BGP feature template.
In Cisco vManage, use a CLI template to configure CSC by CLI.

Configure Carrier Supporting Carrier Using the CLI
We recommend that you use the BGP feature template in Cisco vManage to configure Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices for use with CSC. If it is necessary to configure a device by CLI, use a CLI template in Cisco vManage.
Before You Begin
Before you configure a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device to provide CSC-CE functionality, apply a BGP configuration to the device. The following steps add CSC functionality.
Configure Carrier Supporting Carrier the CLI
Configure the following on CSC-CE1:
Configure the device to map MPLS labels to VRFs. For incoming traffic, the router checks the MPLS label of the traffic and uses the IP loookup table of the VRF mapped to that label. For example, if MPLS label 10 is mapped to VRF 1, then for incoming traffic with the MPLS label 10, the router uses the IP lookup table of VRF 1. For information about mmapping MPLS labels to VRFs, see the Cisco documentation for MPLS forwarding commands.
Device# config-transaction
Device(config)# mpls label mode all-vrfs protocol bgp-vpnv4 per-vrf
Device(config)# mpls label mode all-vrfs protocol bgp-vpnv6 per-vrf
Device(config)# mpls label range min-label max-label static min-static-label max-static-label
Enable multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) on the interface.
Device(config)# interfaceinterface
Device(config-if)# mpls bgp forwarding
Enter router configuration mode and configure the router to run a BGP process.
Device(config-if)# router bgp bgp-number
Configure a CSC-PE device as the neighbor, where neighbor-ip is the address of the neighbor CSC-PE device.
Device(config-router)# neighbor neighbor-ip allowas-in
If the device uses a loopback WAN interface, advertise the ability of the router to send MPLS labels with BGP routes. The explicit-null keyword enables a CSC-CE router to send labels with a value of 0 to its neighbor.

Note
If you include the neighbor neighbor-ip send-label explicit-null command on a device that does not use a loopback WAN interface, it does not adversely impact performance.
Device(config-router)# neighbor neighbor-ip send-label explicit-null
Configure the following on CSC-CE2:
Configure the device to map MPLS labels to VRFs. For incoming traffic, the router checks the MPLS label of the traffic and uses the IP loookup table of the VRF mapped to that label. For example, if MPLS label 10 is mapped to VRF 1, then for incoming traffic with the MPLS label 10, the router uses the IP lookup table of VRF 1. For information about mmapping MPLS labels to VRFs, see the Cisco documentation for MPLS forwarding commands.
Device# config-transaction
Device(config)# mpls label mode all-vrfs protocol bgp-vpnv4 per-vrf
Device(config)# mpls label mode all-vrfs protocol bgp-vpnv6 per-vrf
Device(config)# mpls label range min-label max-label static min-static-label max-static-label
Enable multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) on the interface.
Device(config)# interfaceinterface
Device(config-if)# mpls bgp forwarding
Enter router configuration mode and configure the router to run a BGP process.
Device(config-if)# router bgp bgp-number
Configure a CSC-PE device as the neighbor, where neighbor-ip is the address of the neighbor CSC-PE device.
Device(config-router)# neighbor neighbor-ip as-override
If the device uses a loopback WAN interface, advertise the ability of the router to send MPLS labels with BGP routes.
Device(config-router)# neighbor neighbor-ip send-label explicit-null

Verify That a Device is Configured for Carrier Supporting Carrier
To verify that a device is configured correctly to reach a remote CSC-CE device, execute the show ip route remote-csc-ce-device-address command on the device. Verify that the command output shows the following:
A routing entry for the remote site IP address.
One or more routing descriptor blocks describing the next-hop addresses for the path to the remote CSC-CE device. Verify that each descriptor block includes an MPLS label.
Example
Device# show ip route 10.0.1.100
Routing entry for 10.0.1.0/24
...
Routing Descriptor Blocks:
* 10.1.1.100, from 10.1.1.100, 00:00:50 ago
...
MPLS label: 26
â€¦
If the device is not configured correctly, the output displays the following:
