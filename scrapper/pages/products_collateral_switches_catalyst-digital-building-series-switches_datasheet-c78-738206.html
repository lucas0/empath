    The Cisco® Catalyst® Digital Building Series Switch is the industry’s most power-efficient switch optimized for low-voltage Power over Ethernet (PoE) deployments and connectivity. The Digital Building Series Switch lays the foundation for powering and converging disparate building subsystems (lighting, HVAC, badging systems, metering, CCTV, access) onto a single IP network, thereby expanding, enabling, and accelerating the Cisco Digital Building ecosystem.
Product Overview
Companies today are going digital in an effort to enable new customer experiences, empower workforce innovation, and build innovative business models powered by analytics. Buildings are central to this digital transformation, as buildings are where most traditional businesses run and operate from. For enhanced experiences and improved efficiencies in buildings, owners and facilities managers realize the value in interconnecting various building sub-systems, including lighting, HVAC, security, sensors and audio-video systems, which have historically remained stagnant, disparate and difficult to manage. Although the convergence of these isolated sub-systems is fundamental to digital transformation, it has remained complex and costly to implement thus far.
This complex problem changes their quiet, fanless design and compact footprint, the Cisco Catalyst Digital Building Series Switches offer flexible mounting options and open up a variety of network design and connectivity options. They can be deployed to support a variety of use cases, and are leaps ahead of the last generation of lighting and building technology enablers. Figure 1 shows the Cisco Catalyst Digital Building Switch.
