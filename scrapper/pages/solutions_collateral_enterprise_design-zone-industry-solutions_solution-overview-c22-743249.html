Targeted business outcomes
By connecting noncarpeted spaces to your core IT managed networks, the extended enterprise solution can help drive business outcomes such as:
●     Reduced cost: Lower WAN OpEx and CapEx while maintaining or even improving existing SLAs; manage the entire enterprise network centrally to reduce overall networking and IT infrastructure cost
●     Agility: Quickly deploy new services and applications throughout the WAN network
●     Flexibility: Leverage the best available network connection to provide access to traditional data centers as well as cloud environments
●     Security and control: Provide secure operations and gain insight into the use of the services offered on the WAN
●     New experiences: Enable new digital experiences for your customers and increase customer satisfaction
The extended enterprise
Sensors, cameras, and other smart devices are fueling opportunities to extend digitization into entirely new parts of a business. These investments can support business process transformation, enhanced operational efficiency, and better, more personalized experiences for customers and employees. But they require IT teams to enable secure connectivity to thousands of miles of remotely located assets to be managed alongside the existing IT WAN networks. https://www.cisco.com/go/extendedenterprise
Use cases
Remote point of sale
With the advent of cloud computing, cloud-based Point-Of-Sale (POS) systems serve businesses across energy, utility, retail, wholesale, healthcare, hospitality, and sports industries. Many companies would like to set up remote POS systems in several locations for their customers to make payments. At the authorized payment location, customers can conveniently pay using several different forms of payment. Due to the complete dependence of site operations on WAN connectivity, these remote POS systems require redundant WAN links (LTE/Internet) connected to the enterprise backhaul.
However, the remote POS systems need ruggedized networking products because they are often in areas that are dusty, damp, or without air-conditioning. For such harsh environments, ruggedized SD-WAN-compatible WAN routers, such as the Cisco IR1101 with redundant WAN connectivity, are a preferred choice.
Secure direct Internet access for remote sites
Today, Direct Internet Access (DIA) is much less expensive than traditional Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and leased lines. With many applications moving to cloud, it makes all the more sense to reach out to the cloud applications with a local Internet breakout (DIA) rather than using a traditional centralized data center approach for enterprise Internet connectivity. Another prominent use case is site-to-site mesh connectivity between remote sites. All these create a need for additional security at the branch office and a policy-based centralized WAN management model. Other needs for these remote sites and branches are redundant LTE WAN links over secure private APNs.
Often these remote sites are located in noncarpeted spaces. The Cisco IR1101, a ruggedized SD-WAN-compatible WAN router, is the default choice for such extended enterprise deployments.
Warehouses and distribution centers
Many companies have warehouses and distribution centers spread across the globe. Often located in remote locations, these need redundant and secure mesh WAN connectivity between them.
The harsh environmental conditions at these sites, and the need for policy-driven interconnect options and redundant LTE WAN connectivity, make the Cisco IR1101 highly suitable for secure connectivity.
Extended Enterprise SD-WAN solution features and benefits
The Cisco 1101 Industrial Integrated Services Router Rugged, or IR1101, is Cisco’s smallest industrial router. Designed in a highly modular form factor, it is an ideal solution for many enterprise IT teams to quickly deploy and manage with their existing Cisco vManage SD-WAN solution.
The Cisco IR1101 enables concurrent connectivity to two cellular networks for WAN redundancy, enhanced data throughputs, load balancing, and differentiated services, making it a highly reliable and high-performance platform. It is also SD-WAN capable to enable high WAN availability and simplicity for large-scale extended enterprise distributed networks.

●     By adding scalability, high availability, and reliability in noncarpeted spaces for resilient operations
●     By choosing summarized and simplified designs to accelerate deployment and operation of the extended network
Extended Enterprise SD-WAN CVD
The extended enterprise landscape is continuously evolving. There is a greater demand for mobile and IoT device traffic, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, and cloud adoption. In addition, security needs are increasing, and applications require more prioritization and optimization. As this complexity grows, there is a push to reduce costs and operating expenses. High availability and scale continue to be important.
Legacy WAN architectures are facing major challenges under this evolving landscape. These architectures typically consist of multiple MPLS transports, or an MPLS paired with an Internet or LTE used in an active/backup fashion, most often with Internet or Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) traffic being backhauled to a central data center or regional hub for Internet access. Issues with these architectures include insufficient bandwidth along with high bandwidth costs, application downtime, poor SaaS performance, complex operations, complex workflows for cloud connectivity, long deployment times and policy changes, limited application visibility, and difficulty in securing the network.
Cisco vManage is a single-pane-of glass solution for day-0, day-1, and day-2 operations. It is highly scalable with multitenant capability. It provides a user-friendly GUI interface for configuring and deploying policies and templates.
vManage is multitenant, delivered via the cloud or on-premises, highly automated, secure, scalable, and application-aware with rich analytics.
