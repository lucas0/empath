Prerequisites
Requirements
There are no specific requirements for this document.
Components Used
This document is not restricted to specific software and hardware versions.
Conventions
Refer to the Cisco Technical Tips Conventions for information on document conventions.
Difference Between CatOS and Cisco IOS System Software
CatOS on the Supervisor Engine and Cisco IOSÂ® Software on the Multilayer Switch Feature Card (MSFC) (Hybrid): You can use a CatOS image as the system software in order to run the Supervisor Engine on Catalyst 6500/6000 switches. If you have installed the optional MSFC, use a separate Cisco IOS Software image in order to run the MSFC.
Cisco IOS Software on both the Supervisor Engine and MSFC (Native): You can use a single Cisco IOS Software image as the system software in order to run both the Supervisor Engine and MSFC on Catalyst 6500/6000 switches.
Note: Refer to Comparison of the Cisco Catalyst and Cisco IOS Operating Systems for the Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switch for more information.
Design Guidelines
This section lists some of the guidelines to follow when you design a network with EtherChannels.
Any end of the EtherChannel should be completely on only one device.
In some modular chassis switches, one end of the EtherChannel can span across the modules of the same chassis. Devices that support this design are:
Catalyst 4000/4500 series switches that run Cisco IOS Software
Catalyst 6000/6500 series switches that run Cisco IOS Software
Catalyst 6000/6500 series switches that run Catalyst OS Software 5.1CSX or later
In Catalyst 3750 series switches, the EtherChannel can be formed with interfaces across units within a single switch stack. Refer to Cross-Stack EtherChannel on a Catalyst 3750 Switch Configuration Example for more information on Cross-Stack EtherChannel.
As an EtherChannel cannot terminate on Cisco IP Phones, Cisco recommends to remove any Voice VLAN-related commands from the interfaces/switchports that participate in the EtherChannel.
In switches that run Cisco IOS, Portchannel interfaces (Layer 3 EtherChannels) can have sub-interfaces in the range of 1 to 4,294,967,293. The actual number of sub-interfaces that can be configured depends on the NVRAM capacity of the switch.
Suggested EtherChannel Modes Between Catalyst Switches
This table describes the suggested EtherChannel modes between Catalyst switches.
Recommended EtherChannel Modes Between Catalyst Platforms Neighboring Catalyst Switch (with Connection to This Switch)

* The Catalyst 2900XL/3500XL is a Layer 2 switch that does not have an EtherChannel mode. You must assign a port group to the interface in order to configure an EtherChannel.
** The Catalyst 2948G-L3, 4908G-L3, and 4840G are Layer 3 switches and do not have an EtherChannel mode. The process to configure these switches is similar to the one you use in order to connect a router to a switch and configure the router for port channeling.
