Background Information
IPsec authentication provides built-in anti-replay protection against old or duplicated IPsec packets with the sequence number in the ESP header checked on the receiver. Anti-replay packet drops is one of the most common data-plane issues with IPsec due to packets delivered out of order outside of the anti-replay window. A general troubleshoot approach for IPsec anti-replay drops can be found in IPsec Anti Replay Check Failures, and the general technique applies to SD-WAN as well. However, some implementation differences exist between traditional IPsec and IPsec used in the Cisco SD-WAN solution. This article is intended to explain these differences and the approach on the cEdge platforms with Cisco IOS 速XE.
SD-WAN Replay Detection Considerations
Group Key vs. Pairwise Key
Unlike traditional IPsec, where IPsec SAs are negotiated between two peers with the use of the IKE protocol, SD-WAN uses a group key concept. In this model, an SD-WAN edge device periodically generates data plane inbound SA per TLOC and sends these SAs to the vSmart controller, which in turn propagates the SA to the rest of the edges devices in the SD-WAN network. For a more detailed description of the SD-WAN data plane operations, see SD-WAN Data Plane Security Overview.
Note: Since Cisco IOS 速XE. 6.12.1a/SD-WAN 19.2, IPsec pairwise keys are supported. See IPsec Pairwise Keys Overview. With Pairwise keys, IPsec anti-replay protection works exactly like traditional IPsec. This article primarily focuses on replay check with the use of the group key model.
Encoded SPI
In the IPsec ESP header, the SPI (Security Parameter Index) is a 32-bit value that the receiver uses to identify the SA to which an inbound packet is decrypted with. With SD-WAN, this inbound SPI can be identified with show crypto ipsec sa:
cedge-2#show crypto ipsec sa | se inbound
     inbound esp sas:
      spi: 0x123(291)
        transform: esp-gcm 256 ,
        in use settings ={Transport UDP-Encaps, esn}
        conn id: 2083, flow_id: CSR:83, sibling_flags FFFFFFFF80000008, crypto map: Tunnel1-vesen-head-0
        sa timing: remaining key lifetime 9410 days, 4 hours, 6 mins
        Kilobyte Volume Rekey has been disabled
        IV size: 8 bytes
        replay detection support: Y
        Status: ACTIVE(ACTIVE)
Note: Even though the inbound SPI is the same for all the tunnels, the receiver has a different SA and the correspondent replay-window object associated with the SA for each peer edge device since the SA is identified by the source, destination IP address, source, destination ports 4-tuple, and the SPI number. So essentially, each peer has its own anti-replay window object.
In the actual packet sent by the peer device, notice the SPI value is different from the previous output. Here is an example from the packet-trace output with the packet copy option enabled:
Packet Copy In
  45000102 0cc64000 ff111c5e ac127cd0 ac127cd1 3062303a 00eea51b 04000123

The actual SPI in the ESP header is 0x04000123. The reason for this is that the first bits in the SPI for SD-WAN are encoded with additional information, and only the low bits of the SPI field are allocated for the actual SPI. 
Traditional IPsec:
 0                   1                   2                   3

SD-WAN:

Where:
CTR (first 4 bits, bits 0-3) - Control Bits, used to indicate the specific type of control packets. For example control bit 0x80000000 is used for BFD.
MSNS (next 3 bits, bits 4-6) - Multiple Sequence Number Space Index. This is used to locate the correct sequence counter in the sequence counter array to check for replay for the given packet. For SD-WAN, the 3-bit of MSNS allows for 8 different traffic classes to be mapped into their own sequence number space. This implies the effective SPI value that can be used for SA selection is the reduced low order 25 bits from the full 32-bit value of the field. 
Multiple Sequence Number Space for QoS
It is common to observe IPsec replay failures in an environment where packets are delivered out of order due to QoS, for example, LLQ, since QoS is always run after IPsec encryption and encapsulation. The Multiple Sequence Number Space solution solves this problem with the use of multiple sequence number spaces mapped to different QoS traffic classes for a given Security Association. The different sequence number space is indexed by the MSNS bits encoded in the ESP packet SPI field as depicted. For a more detailed description, please see IPsec Anti Replay Mechanism for QoS. 
As noted previously, this Multiple Sequence Number implementation implies the effective SPI value that can be used for SA selection is the reduced low order 25 bits. Another practical consideration when the replay window size is configured with this implementation is that the configured replay-window size is for the aggregate replay window, so the effective replay window size for each Sequence Number Space is 1/8 of the aggregate.
Configuration example:
config-t
 Security
  IPsec
  replay-window 1024
 Commit
Note: The effective replay window size for each Sequence Number Space is 1024/8 = 128!
Note: Since the Cisco IOS 速XE. 17.2.1, the aggregate replay window size has been increased to 8192 so that each Sequence Number Space can have a maximum replay window of 8192/8 = 1024 packets.  
On a cEdge device, the last sequence number received for each sequence number space can be obtained from the show crypto ipsec sa peer x.x.x.x platform IPsec dataplane output:

In the example, the highest anti-replay window (Right edge of the anti-replay sliding window) for MSNS of 0 (0x00) is 39444, and that for MSNS of 2 (0x04) is 1335, and these counters are used to check if the sequence number is inside of the replay window for packets in the same sequence number space.
Note: There are implementation differences betweem the ASR1k platform and the rest of the Cisco IOS 速XE routing platforms (ISR4k, ISR1k, CSR1kv). As a result, there are some discrepancies in terms of the show commands and their output for these platforms.
It is possible corralate the Anti-Replay erros and the show outputs to find the SPI, and the Sequence number index as shown in the image.
With the previous information obtained the right edge (Top window) and the sliding window looks as shown in the imagen.
Commands to Take Effectiveness of the Configured Replay Window 
Unlike the regular IPsec (non SD-WAN), the rekey command does not takes effect for the anti replay window.
request platform software sdwan security ipsec-rekey
These commands triggers the configured replay window to take effect: 
Warning: Ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command, they affect the control connections and data plane.

Troubleshoot Replay Drop Failures
Troubleshoot Data Collection
For the IPsec anti-replay drops, it is important to understand the conditions and potential triggers of the problem. At a minimum, collect the set of information for to provide the context:
Device information for both the sender and receiver for the replay packet drops, it includes type of device, cEdge vs. vEdge, software version, and configuration.
Problem history. How long has the deployment been in place?  When did the problem start? Any recent changes to the network or traffic conditions.
Any pattern to the replay drops, for example., is it sporadic or constant? Time of the problem and/or significant event, for example, does it only happen during high traffic peak production hours, or only during rekey, and so on.?

With the previous information collected, proceed with the troubleshoot workflow.
Troubleshoot Workflow
The general troubleshooting approach for IPsec replay issues is just like how it is performed for traditional IPsec, take into account the per-peer SA sequence space and Multiple Sequence Number Space as explained. Then go through these steps:
Step 1. First identify the peer for the replay drop from the syslog and the drop rate. For drop statistics, always collect multiple timestamped snapshots of the output so that the drop rate can be quatified:

       19  IN_CD_SW_IPSEC_ANTI_REPLAY_FAIL                            41
Note: It is not uncommon to see occasional replay drops due to packet delivery reordering in the network, but persistent replay drops impact the service and  they can be investigated.
Step 2a. For relatively low traffic rate, take a packet-trace with the condition set to be the peer ipv4 address with the copy packet option and examine the sequence numbers for the packet dropped against the current replay window right edge and sequence numbers in the adjacent packets to confirm if they are indeed duplicate or outside of the replay window.
Step 2b. For high traffic rate with no predictable trigger, configure an EPC capture with circular buffer and EEM to stop the capture when replay errors are detected. Since EEM is currently not supported on vManage as of 19.3, this implies the cEdge would have to be in CLI mode when this troubleshooting task is performed.
Step 3. Collect the show crypto ipsec sa peer x.x.x.x platformon the receiver ideally at the same time the packet capture or packet-trace is collected. This command includes the realtime dataplane replay window information for both the inbound and outbound SA.
Step 4. If the packet dropped is indeed out of order, then take simultaneous captures from both the sender and receiver to identify if the problem is with the source or with the underlay network delivery layer.
Step 5. If the packets are dropped even though they are neither duplicate nor outside of the replay window, then it is usually indicative of a software problem on the receiver.

SD-WAN uses UDP encapsulated ESP:
The UDP header is 304f303b 00770000,
The next is SPI (04000106)
Therefore 00b6e00d is the secuence number (SN).
The MSNS index is 2 (x0400106) due to 32-bit SPI (0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1.)

The highest anti-replay window (Right edge of the anti-replay sliding window) for MSNS of 2 (0x04) is 0b65f00.
Step 7. Expand some forwarded (FWD) captured packets.
Fowarded packets:

Step 8. Collect and obtain the sequence number information from multipe packets forwarded (FWD) before, after and the drops.
FWD:
839 PKT: 00b6e003 FWD 
838 PKT: 00b6e001 FWD 
837 PKT: 00b6e000 FWD 
815 PKT: 00b6e044 FWD 
814 PKT: 00b6dfe8 FWD 
813 PKT: 00b6e00d FWD

DROP:
816 PKT: 00b6dfed DROP
817 PKT: 00b6dfec DROP
818 PKT: 00b6dfeb DROP
819 PKT: 00b6dfe9 DROP
820 PKT: 00b6dfea DROP

Step 9. Convert to Decimal the SN and re order them to simple calculation:
REORDERED:
813 PKT: 00b6e00d FWD --- Decimal: 11984909 
814 PKT: 00b6dfe8 FWD --- Decimal: 11984872 
815 PKT: 00b6e044 FWD --- Decimal: 11984964 ***** Highest Value
816 PKT: 00b6dfed DROP--- Decimal: 11984877
817 PKT: 00b6dfec DROP--- Decimal: 11984876
818 PKT: 00b6dfeb DROP--- Decimal: 11984875
819 PKT: 00b6dfe9 DROP--- Decimal: 11984873
820 PKT: 00b6dfea DROP--- Decimal: 11984874
<snip>
837 PKT: 00b6e014 FWD --- Decimal: 11984916 
838 PKT: 00b6e015 FWD --- Decimal: 11984917
839 PKT: 00b6e016 FWD --- Decimal: 11984918
Note: If the sequence number is greater than the highest sequence number in the window, the packet has its integrity checked. If the packet passes the integrity verification check, the sliding window is then moved to the right.
Step 10. Convert to Decimal the SN and re order them to simple calculation:
Difference:

815 PKT: Decimal: 11984964 ***** Highest Value
--------------------------------------
    815(Highest)  -  X PKT  = Diff
--------------------------------------
816 PKT: 11984964 - 11984877 = 87 DROP
817 PKT: 11984964 - 11984876 = 88 DROP
818 PKT: 11984964 - 11984875 = 89 DROP
819 PKT: 11984964 - 11984873 = 91 DROP
820 PKT: 11984964 - 11984874 = 90 DROP
<snip>
837 PKT: 11984964 - 11984916 = 48 FWD 
838 PKT: 11984964 - 11984917 = 47 FWD 
839 PKT: 11984964 - 11984918 = 45 FWD 
For this example, it is possible to visualize the sliding window with the window size 64 and the right edge11984964 as shown in the image. 
The received sequence number for drop packets is way ahead of the right edge of the replay window for that sequence space.
Solution
Since the window size is still in the previous value 64 as seen in the step 2, one of the commands in the section  Commands to Take Effectiveness of the Configured Replay Window need to be applied in order the 1024 window size takes affect.
Additional Wireshark Capture Tool
Another useful tool to help to correlate the ESP SPI and Sequence number is the Wireshark software.
Note: It is important to collect the packet capture when the issue occurs and if it is possible at the same time the fia trace is collected as described previously
Configure the packet capture for inbound direction and export it to pcap file.
monitor caputure CAP match ipv4 host 10.62.33.91 host 10.62.63.251 buffer size 20 inter TenGigabitEthernet0/0/0 in
monitor caputure CAP star
monitor caputure CAP stop
monitor caputure CAP export bootflash:Anti-replay.pca
When pcap caoture is opened in Wireshark, in order to be able to see the ESP SPI and sequence number, expand one packet, right click and select protocol preferences, search for UDPENCAP and change the default port to SD-WAN port (Source port) as shown in the picture.
After UDPENCAP is in place with the right port, the ESP information is now displayed as shown in the image.
