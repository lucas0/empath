  This document describes the features, issues, and deployment guidelines for Cisco Multi-Site Orchestrator software.
Cisco Multi-Site is an architecture that allows you to interconnect separate Cisco APIC, Cloud APIC, and DCNM domains (fabrics) each representing a different region. This helps ensure multitenant Layer 2 and Layer 3 network connectivity across sites and extends the policy domain end-to-end across the entire system.
Cisco Multi-Site Orchestrator is the intersite policy manager. It provides single-pane management that enables you to monitor the health of all the interconnected sites. It also allows you to centrally define the intersite configurations and policies that can then be pushed to the different Cisco APIC, Cloud APIC, or DCNM fabrics, which in term deploy them in those fabrics. This provides a high degree of control over when and where to deploy the configurations.
For more information, see the “Related Content” section of this document.
Note: The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.

Release 3.3(1e) became available
New Software Features
This release adds the following new features:
Feature
Description
Multi-Site Orchestrator integration with virtual and cloud Nexus Dashboard form factors
Multi-Site Orchestrator can now be deployed as an application on Nexus Dashboard clusters that are deployed in ESX or KVM virtual machines and AWS or Azure clouds.
For additional information including the migration procedure from existing MSO deployments to Release 3.3 in Nexus Dashboard, see Cisco Multi-Site Deployment Guide.
Cloud Site Management for Nexus Dashboard Deployments
Multi-Site Orchestrator service deployed in Nexus Dashboard can now manage AWS and Azure cloud sites.
For additional information, see Cisco Multi-Site Deployment Guide.
Underlay Configuration for Intersite Connectivity
Intersite connectivity between on-prem and cloud sites or multiple cloud sites can now be configured directly from the Multi-Site Orchestrator. In addition, the Infra Configuration page displays underlay and overlay status, configuration deployment status, and the traffic statistics for easy view into intersite infra health.
For additional information, see Cisco Multi-Site Deployment Guide.
Cloud Connectivity without IPSec
Intersite connectivity between two cloud sites of the same type (AWS-to-AWS or Azure-to-Azure) can now be established using private IPs and without IPSec.
For additional information, see Cisco Multi-Site Deployment Guide.
Schema Visualizer Enhancements
Additional enhancements to the Schema visualizer functionality for viewing relationships between networking objects and the ability to zoom in and out for
For additional information, see Cisco Multi-Site Configuration Guide for ACI Fabrics or Cisco Multi-Site Configuration Guide for DCNM Fabrics.
Object Description Fields in UI
Additional “Description” field is now provided for all Multi-Site Orchestrator objects.
For additional information, see Cisco Multi-Site Configuration Guide for ACI Fabrics or Cisco Multi-Site Configuration Guide for DCNM Fabrics.
Tech Support Log Enhancements
Tech support logs, audit logs, and syslogs have been updated with better structure for ease of readability and parsing.
For additional information, see Cisco Multi-Site Configuration Guide for ACI Fabrics or Cisco Multi-Site Configuration Guide for DCNM Fabrics.
Patch API Enhancements
The PATCH API has been updated to allow objects that previously had to be referenced by index to be referenced by their unique identifiers as well.
For additional information, see Cisco Multi-Site REST API Configuration Guide.
Support for Standalone APIC Sites
Multi-Site Orchestrator can manage ACI sites, which are managed by standalone APIC (APIC that is not directly connected to the fabric). For on-boarding, managing, and configuration purposes, these sites behave in the same way as typical on-premises ACI sites managed by APIC.
New Hardware Features
There is no new hardware supported in this release.
The complete list of supported hardware is available in the Cisco Multi-Site  Hardware Requirements Guide.
Changes in Behavior
If you are upgrading to this release, you will see the following changes in behavior:
●     For all new deployments, you must install the Multi-Site Orchestrator application in Nexus Dashboard.
This release supports physical, virtual, and cloud Nexus Dashboard clusters.
Note that the cloud Nexus Dashboard clusters support Cisco APIC and Cisco Cloud APIC site on-boarding only, so you will need to deploy one of the other form factors if you want to use Multi-Site Orchestrator application to manage Cisco DCNM sites.
●     If you are upgrading your existing deployment from a release prior to Release 3.2(1), you must deploy a new Nexus Dashboard cluster and migrate your existing configuration.
The procedure is described in detail in Cisco Multi-Site Deployment Guide.
●     If you deploy in a virtual or cloud Nexus Dashboard cluster version 2.0.2h, downgrading to releases prior to Release 3.3(1) is not supported.
●     If you deploy in a physical Nexus Dashboard cluster version 2.0.1 or 2.0.2, downgrading to releases prior to Release 3.2(1) is not supported.
●     If you are migrating from an earlier release to Release 3.3(1) or later, you may need to resolve any configuration drifts in the object properties that are newly managed by MSO where the default values picked by MSO differ from the custom values set directly in the fabrics' controllers.
Any time Multi-Site Orchestrator adds support for managing object properties that previously had to be managed directly in the APIC, it sets those properties to some default values for existing objects in MSO Schemas but does not push them to sites.
To resolve the configuration drifts, you will need to re-import these objects and their properties from the fabrics’ Controllers and then re-deploy the templates as described in the Cisco Multi-Site Deployment Guide.
●     Site management and on-boarding have moved to a centralized location in the Nexus Dashboard GUI.
When migrating from a release prior to Release 3.2(1), you will need to on-board the sites using the Nexus Dashboard GUI before restoring existing configuration. The procedure is described in detail in Cisco Multi-Site Deployment Guide.
●     User management and authentication have moved to a centralized location in the Nexus Dashboard GUI.
Existing local users defined in Multi-Site Orchestrator will be transferred to the Nexus Dashboard during configuration import.
For existing remote authentication users, you will need to add the remote authentication server to the Nexus Dashboard as described in the Nexus Dashboard User Guide.
●     Starting with Release 3.3(1), the following API changes have been implemented:
PATCH API no longer returns the complete object that was modified, in contrast to prior releases where a complete object (such as schema) was returned by the API.
Because Site Management and User Management have moved to a central location on Nexus Dashboard, the following API changes have been implemented to the corresponding Multi-Site Orchestrator APIs:
◦    User Management API v2 is introduced for querying the new user structures with original API changing to read-only mode (only GET operations are allowed, PUT/POST are removed).
The issue which caused the User Management API v1 to incorrectly return v2 structures in Release 3.2 has been resolved and the v1 API now returns the correct structure similar to Release 3.1.
◦    Site Management API v2 is introduced that allows setting a site to 'managed' or 'unmanaged' in MSO. Previous Site Management APIs are changed to read-only mode (GET operation only). Site onboarding moved to the Nexus Dashboard APIs.
You can no longer remove DHCP Relay and DHCP Option policies until they have been removed from all associated BDs.

For Cisco Multi-Site , Fabric IDs Must be the Same for All Sites, or the Querier IP address Must be Higher on One Site.
The Cisco APIC fabric querier functions have a distributed architecture, where each leaf switch acts as a querier, and packets are flooded. A copy is also replicated to the fabric port. There is an Access Control List (ACL) configured on each TOR to drop this query packet coming from the fabric port. If the source MAC address is the fabric MAC address, unique per fabric, then the MAC address is derived from the fabric-id. The fabric ID is configured by users during initial bring up of a pod site.
In the Cisco Multi-Site  Stretched BD with Layer 2 Broadcast Extension use case, the query packets from each TOR get to the other sites and should be dropped. If the fabric-id is configured differently on the sites, it is not possible to drop them.
To avoid this, configure the fabric IDs the same on each site, or the querier IP address on one of the sites should be higher than on the other sites.
CSCvd61787
STP and "Flood in Encapsulation" Option are not Supported with Cisco Multi-Site.
In Cisco Multi-Site topologies, regardless of whether EPGs are stretched between sites or localized, STP packets do not reach remote sites. Similarly, the "Flood in Encapsulation" option is not supported across sites. In both cases, packets are encapsulated using an FD VNID (fab-encap) of the access VLAN on the ingress TOR. It is a known issue that there is no capability to translate these IDs on the remote sites.
CSCvi61260
If an infra L3Out that is being managed by Cisco Multi-Site is modified locally in a Cisco APIC, Cisco Multi-Site might delete the objects not managed by Cisco Multi-Site  in an L3Out.
CSCvq07769
"Phone Number" field is required in all releases prior to Release 2.2(1). Users with no phone number specified in Release 2.2(1) or later will not be able to log in to the GUI when Orchestrator is downgraded to an earlier release.
CSCvu71584
Routes are not programmed on CSR and the contract config is not pushed to the Cloud site.
CSCvw47022
Shadow of cloud VRF may be unexpectedly created or deleted on the on-premises site.
CSCvt47568
Let's say APIC has EPGs with some contract relationships. If this EPG and the relationships are imported into MSO and then the relationship was removed and deployed to APIC, MSO doesn't delete the contract relationship on the APIC.
Compatibility
This release supports the hardware listed in the Cisco Multi-Site Hardware Requirements Guide.
This release supports Multi-Site Orchestrator deployments in Cisco Nexus Dashboard only. The VMware ESX (.ova) and Cisco Application Services Engine form factors have been deprecated.
If you are deploying Multi-Site Orchestrator in cloud (AWS or Azure) Nexus Dashboard, only Cisco APIC and Cisco Cloud APIC sites can be managed. Virtual (VMware ESX) and physical Nexus Dashboard clusters support Cisco APIC, Cisco Cloud APIC, and Cisco DCNM fabrics.
When managing Cloud APIC sites, this Multi-Site Orchestrator release supports Cisco Cloud APIC, Release 5.2(1) or later only.
When managing on-premises fabrics, this Multi-Site Orchestrator release supports any on-premises Cisco APIC release that can be on-boarded to the Nexus Dashboard.
