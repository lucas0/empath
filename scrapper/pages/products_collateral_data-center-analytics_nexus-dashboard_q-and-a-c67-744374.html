Q.  What is Cisco Nexus® Dashboard?
A.  Cisco Nexus Dashboard is a unified automation platform that provides unprecedented simplicity by integrating operational services to manage customers’ on-premises, cloud, and hybrid data-center networks through a single pane of glass. Using the Cisco Nexus Dashboard, IT operations teams can navigate seamlessly all aspects of infrastructure lifecycle tasks from initial configuration and capacity planning to running and troubleshooting the entire IT infrastructure by leveraging Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights (formerly Nexus Insights) and Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator (formerly Cisco Multi-Site Orchestrator), Cisco Nexus Dashboard Data Broker (formerly Nexus Data Broker) and third-party applications for your mission-critical multicloud data center environment.
Q.  What is Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator?
A.  Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator (formerly Cisco Multi-Site Orchestrator) provides the visibility and connectivity to different fabric controllers and unifies them into one single orchestrator, ensuring that consistent intent-based policies are provisioned properly. You can now achieve visibility, inter-site connectivity and site-wide configuration of multiple fabrics through one pane of glass while leveraging the distributed scale-out model of Cisco ® Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) and Cisco NX-OS with Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC) controllers for on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments.
Q.  What is Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights?
A.  Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights (formerly Nexus Insights) is an application that gives customers the ability to monitor, analyze, troubleshoot and assure their networks in real time. It helps identify anomalies, provide root-cause analysis, plan capacity, manage change, and accelerate troubleshooting. By tracking historical context, collecting and processing hardware and software telemetry data, and correlating customer designs with Cisco best practices, customers can get excellent visibility and awareness of issues affecting their environment and take corrective actions.
It also includes network assurance capabilities that were formerly provided by the Cisco Network Assurance Engine (NAE) to enable customers to continuously analyze and verify that their network state is consistent with intent. Customers can ensure that network policies are compliant with business rules, validate network changes before deploying them, and determine network impact due to changes between any two points in time. You can perform natural language queries to gain in-depth connectivity knowledge of their network, of what policies enable which network elements, and of the relationships between communication and virtual resources in real time.
Q.  What is the Cisco Nexus Dashboard Data Broker?
A.  Cisco Nexus Dashboard Data Broker (formerly Nexus Data Broker), is now a part of Cisco Nexus Dashboard, enabling NetOps to programmatically manage aggregating, filtering, and forwarding complete flows to custom analytics tools.
Q.  What is the role of the Cisco Nexus Dashboard platform?
A.  The new Cisco Nexus Dashboard unleashes a unified experience and automation workflows by standardizing on the Cisco Nexus Dashboard platform (physical/virtual/cloud). Customers can now standardize operations’ processes on a single platform and teams can use advanced visibility, monitoring, orchestration and deployment services from a unified pane of glass. The Cisco Nexus Dashboard platform can be deployed across the hybrid cloud infrastructure in the form factor of your choosing (physical/virtual or cloud). The Nexus Dashboard platform is extensible. The Cisco Nexus Dashboard platform integrates with third-party services such as ServiceNow and Splunk and also provides the central point for cross-domain integrations.
