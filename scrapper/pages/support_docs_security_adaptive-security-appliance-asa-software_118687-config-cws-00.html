Introduction
This document describes how to use the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) with the Context Aware (CX) module, also known as the Next Generation firewall, and Cisco Cloud Web Security (CWS) Connector.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have:
3DES/AES License on ASA (Free license)
Valid CWS service/license to use CWS for the required number of users
Access to ScanCenter Portal to generate the Authentication Key
Components Used
This document is not restricted to specific software and hardware versions.
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Background Information
Scope
This document shows these areas of technology and products:
Cisco ASA 5500-X Series Adaptive Security Appliances provides Internet edge firewall security and intrusion prevention.
Cisco Cloud Web Security provides granular control over all web content that is accessed.
Use Case
The ASA CX/FirePower module has the capability to support both the Content Security and Intrusion Prevention requirement, dependent upon the license features enabled on the ASA CX/FirePower. Cloud Web Security is not supported with the ASA CX/FirePower module. If you configure both the ASA CX/FirePower action and Cloud Web Security inspection for the same traffic flow, the ASA only performs the ASA CX/FirePower action. In order to leverage the CWS features for Web Security, you need to ensure the traffic is bypassed in the match statement for ASA CX/FirePower. Typically, in such a scenario, customers will use CWS for Web Security and AVC (port 80 and 443) and CX/FirePower module for all other ports.
Key Points
The match default-inspection-traffic command does not include the default ports for the Cloud Web Security inspection (80 and 443).
Actions are applied to traffic bidirectionally or unidirectionally dependent upon the feature. For features that are applied bidirectionally, all traffic that enters or exits the interface to which you apply the policy map is affected if the traffic matches the class map for both directions. When you use a global policy all features are unidirectional; features that are normally bidirectional when applied to a single interface only apply to the ingress of each interface when applied globally. Because the policy is applied to all interfaces, the policy is applied in both directions so bidirectionality in this case is redundant.
For TCP and UDP traffic (and Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) when you enable stateful ICMP inspection), service policies operate on traffic flows and not just individual packets. If traffic is part of an existing connection that matches a feature in a policy on one interface, that traffic flow cannot also match the same feature in a policy on another interface; only the first policy is used.
Interface service policies take precedence over the global service policy for a given feature.
The maximum number of policy maps is 64, but you can only apply one policy map per interface.

Network Diagram
Traffic Flow for the ASA and CWS
The user requests the URL via the web browser.
Traffic is sent to the ASA to go out the Internet. The ASA performs required NAT and based on the protocol HTTP/HTTPS, matches to the inside interface policy and gets redirected to Cisco CWS.
CWS analyzes the request based on the configuration done in the ScanCenter portal and if policy permits, forwards the request to approved sites.
CWS inspects the returned traffic and redirects the same to ASA.
Based on the session flow maintained, ASA sends traffic back to the user.
Traffic Flow for the ASA and CX/FirePower
All traffic other than HTTP and HTTPS is configured to match the ASA CX/FirePower for inspection and is redirected to CX/FirePower over the ASA backplane.
The ASA CX/FirePower inspects traffic based on the policies configured and takes the required allow/block/alert action.

Note: In this example, it is assumed that web traffic originates only from inside the security zone. You can use interface policies on all interfaces where you expect web traffic or use the same classes within the global policy. This is just to demonstrate the functioning of CWS and use of MPF in order to support our requirement.

In order to ensure that all connections use the new policy, you need to disconnect the current connections so they can reconnect with the new policy. See the clear conn or clear local-host commands.
Verify
Use this section to confirm that your configuration works properly.
Enter the show scansafe statistics command in order to verify the service to be enabled and that the ASA redirects traffic. Subsequent tries show the increment in session counts, current sessions, and bytes transferred.
