Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCvm03681 EAP-FAST doesn't support correct key generation in TLS 1.2
Problem Description
Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) fails to authenticate endpoint devices when using Extensible Authentication Protocol-Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling (EAP-FAST) with Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2. This issue occurs with these Cisco products and versions and might occur with other supplicants that add TLS 1.2 support:
Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Release 4.7
Cisco IP Phone 8821 Firmware Release 11.0(5)
Background
With EAP-FAST and Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol Version 2 (MSCHAPv2), the Authenticator/Peer negotiation for Anonymous Protected Access Credential (PAC) provisioning is computed from the pseudo-random function (PRF). For this issue, the PRFs differ and, as a result, the inner MSCHAP authentication will fail with a wrong password error message.
Problem Symptom
When EAP-FAST is used with any affected ISE releases and the supplicant attempts to use TLS 1.2, authentication will fail and endpoints will not have access to the network.
Workaround/Solution
In order to resolve this issue, upgrade the ISE software as shown for these releases:
ISE Release 2.4 Patch 5 or later.
ISE Release 2.3 Patch 6 or later.
ISE Release 2.2 Patch 13 or later.
ISE Release 2.1 Patch 8 or later.
ISE Releases 2.0 and 2.0.1 - It is required to install the Struts2-CVE-2018-11776 PSIRT fix, which can be obtained on Cisco.com from the ISE Software Download page, before you apply the hot patch.
Note: In order to obtain the hot patches for ISE releases 2.0 and 2.0.1, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC). Ensure the ISE software has the latest patch applied before you apply the hot patch.
