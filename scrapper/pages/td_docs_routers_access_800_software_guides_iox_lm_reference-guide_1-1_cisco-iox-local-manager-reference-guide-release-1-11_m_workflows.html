App Lifecycle Workflows
App lifecycle workflows include the operations that you use to add, activate, deactivate, start, stop, upgrade, and delete an app.
There is no limit, other than system resource restrictions, on the number of apps that can simultaneously have the status of DEPLOYED. For PAAS apps, there also is no limit on how many can simultaneously have the status of ACTIVATED, or STARTED. For VM apps, only one can have the status of ACTIVATED or STARTED at a time.
The following sections describe these workflows:
Adding/Deploying an App
Activating an App
Deactivating an App
Starting an App
Stopping an App
Upgrading an App
Deleting an App
Adding/Deploying an App
Adding an app uploads the app file to the host system. The app can be a tarball or OVA file. After you add the app, it appears on the Cisco IOx Local Manager Applications page and has status DEPLOYED. System CPU and RAM resources are not yet reserved for the app. An app with this status can be activated, upgraded, or deleted.
To add an app, perform the following steps.
Before You Begin
Make sure that the app tarball or OVA file is stored in a local or network location that the system from which you logged in to Cisco IOx Local Manager can access.
SUMMARY STEPS
Choose Applications from the Cisco IOx Local Manager menu bar.
Click the Add/Deploy button on the Applications page.
In the Application ID field in the Deploy application dialog box, enter a unique identifier to be assigned to the app.
In the Deploy application dialog box, click the Choose File button and follow the on-screen prompts to locate and select the app OVA or tarball file.
If you are adding an app OVA file, in the Deploy OVA dialog box, take these actions:

To ensure that the upload completes successfully, do not refresh your browser or attempt another Cisco IOx Local Manager operation while the upload is in process.
Step 7
In the Successfully Deployed dialog box, click the OK button.
Activating an App
Activating an app reserves host system CPU and memory (RAM) resources that the app requires to run, designates the network from which the app obtains its IP address, and assigns host system serial ports for use by the app, if requested. After you activate an app, its status on the Cisco IOx Applications page appears as ACTIVATED.
You can activate an app that has a status of DEPLOYED.
As part of the activation process, you designate a resource profile for the app. A resource profile defines the amount of CPU and memory resources that the app needs to run. You can choose from several preset resource profiles or enter custom values for a profile. See the App-ID > Resources Page section for more information.
When an app is activated, the host system reserves the resources that the app needs to run, but the resources are not used until the app starts. You cannot activate an app if the host system does not have sufficient resources available for the app to run.
In addition, for a PAAS app, the appropriate cartridges must be installed before the app can be activated.
To activate an app, follow these steps:
SUMMARY STEPS
Choose Applications from the Cisco IOx Local Manager menu bar.
Make sure that DEPLOYED appears in the Status field for the app that you want to activate.
Click activate in the Actions field for the app that you want to activate.
Make sure that the Resources tab is selected on the App-ID page.
In the Resource Profile area, take these actions to choose a resource profile, which designates the host system CPU and memory resources that the app requires when it runs:
In the Advanced Settings area, take the following actions as needed.
In the Network Configuration area, take the following actions to designate the logical network from which the app obtains its IP address.
(Optional) In the VNC Options area, take the following actions.
In the Peripheral Configuration area, take these actions to define peripheral devices that are attached to the host system and that the app controls:
If you are activating a Docker type app on a host system that does not support native Docker or are activating a PAAS type app, and if you want to run the app in debug mode, check the debug mode check box.
Click the Activate button top right of the Resources tab.
DETAILED STEPS
Step 1
Choose Applications from the Cisco IOx Local Manager menu bar.
The Applications page displays.
Step 2
Make sure that DEPLOYED appears in the Status field for the app that you want to activate.
Step 3
Click activate in the Actions field for the app that you want to activate.
The App-ID page for the app appears.
Step 4
Make sure that the Resources tab is selected on the App-ID page.
Step 5
In the Resource Profile area, take these actions to choose a resource profile, which designates the host system CPU and memory resources that the app requires when it runs:
From the Profile drop-down list, choose one of the following options, which designates the host system CPU and memory resources that the app requires when it runs on the host system:
c1.tiny , c1.small , c1.medium , c1.large , or c1.xlarge —Assigns CPU and memory resources automatically. These values are based on the host system hardware.
default —Assigns CPU and memory resources based on the requirement that is specified in the metadata for the app.
custom —Lets you enter your own CPU and memory values in the CPU and memory fields.
exclusive —Allocates all resources on the host system to the app.
If you choose an option other than custom , Cisco Local Manager enters information in the CPU and Memory fields based on the option that you choose, and these fields become read only.
If you choose custom from the Profile drop-down list, in the CPU field, enter the CPU units that the app requires on the host system when it runs, and in the Memory field, enter the amount of RAM, in MB, that the app requires when it runs.
Make sure that you do not enter a CPU or memory value that exceeds the available CPU or memory resources that display at the bottom of the Resource Profile area. If you enter a value that exceeds resource availability, the app cannot be activated.
In the Disk field, enter the disk space, in MB, that the app requires on the host system when it runs.
Make sure that you do not enter disk space value that exceeds the available disk space that displays at the bottom of the Resource Profile area. If you enter a value that exceeds resource availability, the app cannot be activated.
If needed, refer to the app documentation or developer for information regarding resources that an app requires when it runs.
Step 6
In the Advanced Settings area, take the following actions as needed.
This area appears only if the app type is Docker and the host system supports native Docker.
In the Docker Options field, enter one or more Docker run options to be used when you activate the app.
This field includes the --rm option by default (see the following bullet point).
Check the Auto delete container instance check box to add the --rm run option to the Docker Options field and to use this option when you activate the app.
When you stop an app that you activated and started with the --rm option, the app container instance is deleted automatically and the app goes to DEPLOYED state (rather than STOPPED state).
This check box is checked by default.
Step 7
In the Network Configuration area, take the following actions to designate the logical network from which the app obtains its IP address.
The internal interfaces of the app in this area appear as ethX , where X is a number. The number of internal interfaces depend on the number of network interfaces that the app defines in its metadata. For example, if the app metadata defines one network interface, eth0 appears in this area. If the app metadata defines two network interfaces, eth0 and eith1 appear in this area.
Click the Add App Network Interface button.
In the Interface Name field, enter a unique name for the interface. The name can be from 1 to 40 characters in length, and can include alphanumeric characters and underscores characters (_).
Click OK .
From the drop-down list that appears next to the interface name that you entered, choose an option to designate how the app obtains its IP address.
In each drop-down list option, # is a number that matches the number at the end of the corresponding interface name of the internal Cisco IOx bridge that provides connectivity for an internal network. For example, the logical network iox-bridge0 corresponds to the interface name svcbr_0. Similarly, the logical network iox-nat1 corresponds to the interface name svcbr_1. Description is a description of the network interface.
The options that are available in this list depend on the type of host system. Here are examples of some options that can appear:
iox-nat_docker0—App obtains its IP address from an internal native Docker network address translator
iox-bridge#—App obtains its IP address from a DHCP pool that is configured in Cisco IOS
The Port Mapping link displays to the right of the drop-down list if you choose a nat type network from the drop-down list for an app whose metadata requests TCP or UDP ports to be open on a network interface and if the interface is connected to a NAT network.
The Interface Setting link displays to the right of the drop-down list if you choose a network other than a nat type.
If the Port Mapping link displays, take these actions:
Click the Port Mapping link.
The Port Mapping dialog box appears. This dialog box lets you configure TCP port mappings and UDP port mappings for the app. It also includes port mapping tables that show the mapping of internal ports to the corresponding external ports that the app requests, as defined in the metadata for the app.
To cause the system to map ports automatically, click the Auto radio button, or to enter port mapping information manually, click the Custom radio button.
The system takes the auto action by default.
Click the Add TCP port mapping button, and take these actions:
In the Internal Port(s) field, enter the port from the app container that is to be mapped to the external port.
F you clicked the click the Custom radio button, in the Internal Port(s) field, enter the ports on the host system to which you want to map the corresponding internal ports.
You can repeat this sub-step as needed to configure additional TCP port mappings.

In the IPv4 Setting area click one of these radio buttons:
Static —Select this option to use a static IPv4 address. In the IP/Mask field that displays, enter the static address and subnet mask to use. In the DNS field that displays, optionally enter the IP address of the DNS server that the app uses for external communication. In the Gateway IP field that appears, enter the IP address of the gateway that the app uses for external communication. This field is optional if you do not check the Default Gateway check box, and is required otherwise. Check the Default Gateway check box if you want to make the gateway that you designate in the Gateway IP field the default gateway.
Dynamic —Select this option if you want to assign IPv4 addresses dynamically.
Disable —Select this option do not want to use an IPv4 address for the network interface.
In the IPv6 Setting area click one of these radio buttons:
Static —Select this option to use a static IPv6 address. In the IP/Mask field that displays, enter the static address and subnet mask to use. In the DNS field that displays, optionally enter the IP address of the DNS server that the app uses for external communication. In the Gateway IP field that appears, enter the IP address of the gateway that the app uses for external communication. This field is optional if you do not check the Default Gateway check box, and is required otherwise. Check the Default Gateway check box if you want to make the gateway that you designate in the Gateway IP field the default gateway.
Dynamic —Select this option if you want to assign IPv6 addresses dynamically.
Disable —Select this option do not want to use an IPv6 address for the network interface.
In the DHCP Client IP ID field, enter the DHCP client ID that is sent to the DHCP server.
If you enter a value, and if the DHCP server has been configured with a static binding that maps a client ID string to a specific IP address, the DHCP server assigns the mapped IP address to the app when the app boots up.
In the Vlan ID field, enter the identifier of the VLAN on which this internal network operates. Valid values are 1 through 4000.
This field displays if your host system supports VLAN.
Check the Mirror Mode Enabled field, check box to enable port mirroring for the app. Port mirroring is used to monitor network traffic. When this option is enabled, copies of incoming and outgoing packets at the ports of a network device are flooded to the network bridge domain
This check box displays if mirroring is asked for in the package.yaml file for the app and if the host system supports port mirroring on the selected network interface
Click OK .
Click the Add button to add the network interface.
You can repeat this Step 7 as needed to configure additional network interfaces.
Step 8
(Optional) In the VNC Options area, take the following actions.

In the Password field, enter a password for accessing an app via a VNC session.
Use this password in the VNC client that you use to access the app.
In the Port field, enter a port number to be used for accessing the app via a VNC session.
If you do not enter a port number, the system assigns a value. Valid port numbers are 5900 through 65535.
Step 9
In the Peripheral Configuration area, take these actions to define peripheral devices that are attached to the host system and that the app controls:
Click the Add App Peripheral button.
From the Device Type drop-down list, choose one of these options:
serial —Displays if the host device supports serial ports for the app to use
USB_storage —Displays if USB storage devices are available on the host device for the app to use
USB_serial —Displays if USB serial devices are available on the host device for the app to use
USB_port —Displays if the host device supports USB ports for the app to use
If you choose serial from the Device Type drop-down list, from the Device Name drop-down list, choose the device that you want. The items that display in this list depend on the serial ports that are available on the host system.
The Device Name drop-down list does not display if you choose USB_storage or USB_serial from the Device Type drop-down list.
If you choose USB_storage or USB_serial from the Device Type drop-down list, click a radio button to select the device that you want. The radio buttons that display depend on the devices that are connected to the host system.
In the Label field, type an ID for the app to use to identify the peripheral device.
Click Add .
You can repeat this Step 9 as needed to define additional peripheral devices.
Before you activate the app, you can click the edit link in the App Peripherals table to update configuration settings for the corresponding peripheral device, or click the delete link in this table to delete the corresponding device configuration.
Each device in the Peripherals table must be in the Present state for you to be able to activate the app.
Step 10
If you are activating a Docker type app on a host system that does not support native Docker or are activating a PAAS type app, and if you want to run the app in debug mode, check the debug mode check box.
If an app that is running in debug mode shuts down unexpectedly, the app does not go to STOPPED state. Instead, the app remains in RUNNING state so that you can use an SSH client to access the app and troubleshoot.
Step 11
Click the Activate button top right of the Resources tab.
If sufficient CPU and memory resources are available on the host system, the activation process executes. This process can takes some time.
To ensure that the activation completes successfully, do not refresh your browser or attempt another Cisco IOx Local Manager operation while the activation is in process.
Deactivating an App
Deactivating an app releases the host system CPU and memory (RAM) resources that were reserved for the app and makes these resources available of other uses. After you deactivate an app, its status on the Cisco IOx Applications page appears as DEPLOYED.

Cartridge Management Workflows
A Cisco IOx app can be a PAAS type, a KVM type, LXC app, or a Docker type. Unlike a KVM, Docker, or LXC, a PAAS app, which typically is created with a higher-level language such as Java or Python, is in a package that contains only files for the app logic. The package does not include Linux operating system files or the root file system that the app requires.
To activate, a PAAS app requires cartridges, which are Cisco-provided files that you install on the host system.
If an app requires cartridges but the cartridges are not yet installed, you can still add the app in Cisco IOx Local Manager. However, you must install the required cartridges before you can activate the app. To determine whether an app requires cartridges, you can look at the Cartridge Required field on the App-ID > App-Info page. See the App-ID > App-info Page section for more information.
Cartridge management workflows include the operations that you use to install, delete, and view information about cartridges. The following sections describe these workflows:
Installing a Cartridge
Deleting a Cartridge
Viewing Detailed Information about a Cartridge
Installing a Cartridge
Installing a cartridge uploads it to the host system and makes it available to the apps that require it.
To install a cartridge, perform the following steps.

Layer Management Workflow
A layer is a component of a Docker image from which an app package has been created.
When Local Manager installs an app, the Cisco application-hosting framework identifies the layers that the app requires and installs the required layers.
When you delete an app, the system does not automatically remove from the host system the layers that relate to that app. Similarly, when you upgrade an app and the new version no longer needs some layers that were used by the older version, the system does not automatically remove from the host system the layers that are no longer used. In both cases, if you want to remove unused layers from the device, you must remove them manually. This process is useful if you need to free up disk space on this host system.
You can delete any layer that is not in use by an installed app. To do so, follow these steps:
SUMMARY STEPS
Choose Docker Layers from the Cisco IOx Local Manager menu bar.
On the Cartridges page, click Delete Unused Layers at the bottom of the Layers area.

Remote Docker App Workflow
Cisco Local Manager provides access from your local PC to Docker apps on the host system so that you can test and troubleshooting these apps. After you enable this remote Docker access, you download to your local PC a TLS certificate file, which allows communication with the Docker engine on the host system. You then can create a Docker app profile, which sets up app network interfaces, peripheral devices, and a persistent data file on the platform.
As part of this profile creation, Cisco IOx provides associated Docker runtime options for you to use when you run the app.
After your local PC is set up for remote Docker access, you can run the Docker app on the host system. When you have validated that the app runs as it should, you can generate and download an IOx package descriptor (package.yaml) file for the app. You can use this package.yaml file and the ioxclient tool to create the IOx application package, which you should verify again by deploying the app.
To enable remote Docker access, create a Docker app profile, and test the app, follow these steps:
SUMMARY STEPS
Choose Remote Docker Workflow from the Cisco IOx Local Manager menu bar.
In the Step 1, Enable Remote Docker Access area, take these actions:
Copy the TLS certs.tar file to one of these directories:
Set the following environment variables as shown on your local system to provide access from your local machine to the Docker engine:
In the App Profile area, take one of the following actions.
If you are creating a new Docker app profile, take the following actions in the App Resource area:
If you are creating a new Docker app profile, in the App Network Interfaces area, take these actions to configure the interfaces that the app uses for network access:

On Microsoft Windows systems: %USERPROFILE%/.docker
Step 4
Set the following environment variables as shown on your local system to provide access from your local machine to the Docker engine:
DOCKER_HOST=tcp://Externally_Reacheable_Host_Sytem_IP_Address:2376
DOCKER_TLS=1
DOCKER_API_VERSION=1.37
Step 5
In the App Profile area, take one of the following actions.
A Docker app profile defines host system resources that the app requires, network interfaces for the app, peripheral devices that the app controls, and a persistent data file for the app.
To use an existing Docker app profile, choose the profile from the Docker App Profiles drop-down list. Skip to Step 9.
To create a new Docker app profile, click the Add New button, enter a unique name for the profile in the Profile Name field, and then click the OK button. The name can be from 1 to 40 characters in length, and can include alphanumeric characters and underscores (_). Continue to Step 6.
To delete an existing Docker app profile, choose the profile from Docker App Profiles drop-down list, click the Delete button, and then click Yes in the confirmation dialog box that pop up.
Step 6
If you are creating a new Docker app profile, take the following actions in the App Resource area:
From the Profile drop-down list, choose a resource profile, which designates the host system CPU and memory resources that the app requires when it runs on the host system.
Cisco Local Manager provides these resource profiles:
c1.tiny , c1.small , c1.medium , c1.large , or c1.xlarge —Assigns CPU and memory resources automatically. These values are based on the host system hardware.
default —Assigns CPU and memory resources based on the requirement that is specified in the metadata for the app.
custom —Lets you enter your own CPU and memory values in the CPU and memory fields.
exclusive —Allocates all resources on the host system to the app.
If you choose an option other than custom , Cisco Local Manager enters information in the CPU and Memory fields based on the option that you choose, and these fields become read only.
If you choose custom from the Profile drop-down list, in the CPU field, enter the number of CPU units that the app requires on the host system when it runs, and in the Memory field, enter the amount of RAM, in MB, that the app requires when it runs.
In the Disk field, enter the disk space, in MB, that the app requires on the host system when it runs.
Make sure that you do not enter a CPU, memory, or disk value that exceeds the available CPU, memory, or disk resources that display at the bottom of the App Resource area. If you enter a value that exceeds resource availability, the Docker app profile cannot be created.
If needed, see the app documentation or developer for information regarding resources that an app requires when it runs.
Step 7
If you are creating a new Docker app profile, in the App Network Interfaces area, take these actions to configure the interfaces that the app uses for network access:
Click the Add App Network Interface button.
In the Interface Name field, enter a unique name for the interface. The name can be from 1 to 40 characters in length, and can include alphanumeric characters and underscores characters (_).
Click OK .
From the drop-down list that appears next to the interface name that you entered, choose an option to designate how the app obtains its IP address.
The options that are available in this list depend on the type of host system. Here are examples of some options that can appear:
iox-nat_docker0—App obtains its IP address from an internal native Docker network address translator
iox-bridge#—App obtains its IP address from a DHCP pool that is configured in Cisco IOS
The Port Mapping link displays to the right of the drop-down list if you choose a nat type network from the drop-down list for an app whose metadata requests TCP or UDP ports to be open on a network interface and if the interface is connected to a NAT network.
The Interface Setting link displays to the right of the drop-down list if you choose a network other than a nat type.
If the Port Mapping link displays, take these actions:
Click the Port Mapping link.
The Port Mapping dialog box appears. This dialog box lets you configure TCP port mappings and UDP port mappings for the app. It also includes port mapping tables that show the mapping of internal ports to the corresponding external ports that the app requests, as defined in the metadata for the app.
To cause the system to map ports automatically, click the Auto radio button, or to enter port mapping information manually, click the Custom radio button.
The system takes the auto action by default.
Click the Add TCP port mapping button, and take these actions:
In the Internal Port(s) field, enter the port from the app container that is to be mapped to the external port.
If you clicked the click the Custom radio button, in the External Port(s) field, enter the ports on the host system to which you want to map the corresponding internal ports.
You can repeat this sub-step as needed to configure additional TCP port mappings.
Click the Add UDP port mapping button, and take these actions:
In the Internal Port(s) field, enter the port from the app container that is to be mapped to the external port.
If you clicked the click the Custom radio button, in the External Port(s) field, enter the ports on the host system to which you want to map the corresponding internal ports.
You can repeat this sub-step as needed to configure additional UDP port mappings.
Click OK .
If the Interface Setting link displays, take these actions:
Click the Interface Setting link.
The Interface Setting dialog box appears. This dialog box lets you configure IPv4 and IPv6 interface settings for the app.
In the IPv4 Setting area click one of these radio buttons:
Static —Select this option to use a static IPv4 address. In the IP/Mask field that displays, enter the static address and subnet mask to use. In the DNS field that displays, optionally enter the IP address of the DNS server that the app uses for external communication. In the Gateway IP field that appears, enter the IP address of the gateway that the app uses for external communication. This field is optional if you do not check the Default Gateway check box, and is required otherwise. Check the Default Gateway check box if you want to make the gateway that you designate in the Gateway IP field the default gateway
Dynamic —Select this option if you want to assign IPv4 addresses dynamically.
Disable —Select this option do not want to use an IPv4 address for the network interface.
In the IPv6 Setting area click one of these radio buttons:
Static —Select this option to use a static IPv6 address. In the IP/Mask field that displays, enter the static address and subnet mask to use. In the DNS field that displays, optionally enter the IP address of the DNS server that the app uses for external communication. In the Gateway IP field that appears, enter the IP address of the gateway that the app uses for external communication. This field is optional if you do not check the Default Gateway check box, and is required otherwise. Check the Default Gateway check box if you want to make the gateway that you designate in the Gateway IP field the default gateway
Dynamic —Select this option if you want to assign IPv6 addresses dynamically.
Disable —Select this option do not want to use an IPv6 address for the network interface.
In the DHCP Client ID field, enter the DCHP client ID that is sent to the DHCP server.
If you enter a value, and if the DHCP server has been configured with a static binding that maps a client ID string to a specific IP address, the DHCP server assigns the mapped IP address to the app when the app boots up.
In the Vlan ID field, enter the identifier of the VLAN on which this internal network operates.
This field displays only if the network and the device support VLAN hosting.
Click the OK .
Click the Add button to add the network interface.
You can repeat this Step 7 as needed to configure additional network interfaces..
Before you submit the Docker app profile that you are creating, you can click the edit link in the App Network Interfaces table to update configuration settings for the corresponding interface, or click the delete link in this table to delete the corresponding interface.
Step 8
If you are creating a new Docker app profile, in the App Peripherals area, take these actions to define peripheral devices that are attached to the host system and that the app controls:
Click the Add App Peripheral button.
From the Device Type drop-down list, choose one of these options:
serial —Displays if the host device supports serial ports for the app to use
USB-storage —Displays if USB storage devices are available on the host device for the app to use
USB-serial —Displays if USB serial devices are available on the host device for the app to use
If you choose serial from the Device Type drop-down list, from the Device Name drop-down list, choose the device that you want. The items that display in this list depend on the devices that are connected to the host system.
The Device Name drop-down list does not display if you choose USB-storage or USB-serial from the Device Type drop-down list.
If you choose USB-storage or USB-serial from the Device Type drop-down list, click a radio button to select the device that you want. The radio buttons that display depend on the devices that are connected to the host system.
In the Label field, type an ID for the app to use to identify the peripheral device.
Click Add , and then click OK in the Add Peripheral dialog box that pops-up.
