Chapter: Migrate Shared Templates to Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Templates
Chapter Contents
Overview
In Cisco vManage 20.1.1, support is added for for additional feature templates exclusively for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
In releases before Cisco vManage 20.1.1, when you created a template for both Cisco vEdge and Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices, the same template is shared for both device types. For these templates, the configuration is specified using Cisco vEdge commands. If the template is then used with a Cisco IOS XE device, the configuration was converted for Cisco IOS XE devices. Due to this conversion of Cisco vEdge commands, some functionality was not unavailable for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. For example, NAT DIA.
In these releases, there are two types of shared templates:
Shared feature templates: If you specify a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device when creating a feature template, a shared feature template is created.
Shared device templates: A device template that contains a shared feature template.
In Cisco vManage 20.1.1 and onwards, feature templates have been separated for Cisco vEdge devices and Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. These feature templates that are exclusively created for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices enable support for additional features. To use these feature templates, you can migrate your shared feature templates to the exclusive templates.
List of Migrated Templates
The following table lists the shared templates and their corresponding exclusive templates for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices available in Cisco vManage 20.1.1 and onwards.

Note
The AAA feature template is not supported with the exclusive Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device feature templates.
If your existing template contains an AAA feature template, you can replace it either before migration or after migration:
Before migration—Replace it with the AAA-Cisco template that was introduced in 19.1.
or
After migration—After the migration is complete, manually create a Cisco AAA template and attach it to your device template.

Migrate Shared Templates
You can continue using the older shared templates, however the shared templates may not have access to the latest features. We recommend migrating existing templates to enable access to the latest features. For example, if you are using the VPN Interface Ethernet shared template, the template still continues to work. However to use new features, such as NAT DIA, you must migrate to the exclusive feature template called Cisco VPN Interface Ethernet.
Migrate Shared Templates Using the Cisco vManage Migration Tool
Prerequisites:
At least one Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device template should exist with shared Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device feature templates attached prior to upgrading to Cisco vManage 20.1.1 or higher.
To migrate existing shared templates using Cisco vManage, perform the following steps:
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Tools > Template Migration.
Click Migrate All Templates.
Enter a prefix for the new migrated templates. For example Migrated_. All migrated templates are prefixed with this identifier.
To migrate the templates, click OK.
Once the migration begins, click Tasks to track the status of the migration.
Once the migration is complete, you must manually attach the migrated templates to your devices. For each of the migrated templates, click ... and choose Attach Devices to Migrated Template.
