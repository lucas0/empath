Understanding Cisco Collaboration Foundations (CLFNDU) v1.1
What you'll learn in this course
The Understanding Cisco Collaboration Foundations (CLFNDU) v1.1 course gives you the skills and knowledge needed to administer and support a simple, single-site Cisco速 Unified Communications Manager (CM) solution with Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) gateway. The course covers initial parameters, management of devices including phones and video endpoints, management of users, and management of media resources, as well as Cisco Unified Communications solutions maintenance and troubleshooting tools. In addition, you will learn the basics of SIP dial plans including connectivity to Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) services, and how to use class-of-service capabilities. This course also earns you 30 Continuing Education (CE) credits towards recertification.
This course does not lead directly to a certification exam, but it does cover foundational knowledge that can help you prepare for several professional-level collaboration courses and exams:
