Product overview
The Cisco® High-Density Analog Voice and Fax Service Modules provide enterprises, managed services providers, and service providers the ability to directly connect public-switched telephone networks (PSTNs) and existing telephony equipment to Cisco 4000 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISRs). These fixed-port (FXS and FXO) modules provide Dual-Tone Multifrequency (DTMF) detection, voice compression and decompression, call progress tone generation, Voice Activity Detection (VAD), echo cancellation, and adaptive jitter buffering.
Product details
The FXO port is used to connect to PBX or key systems, or to provide off-premises connections to the PSTN. It supports battery reversal detection and caller ID. The FXO port is also used to connect to analog Centralized Automatic Message Accounting (CAMA) trunks to provide dedicated E-911 service (in North America only).
The FXS port is used to connect analog phones, modems, fax machines, and speaker phones to an enterprise IP voice system, so you can use them as extensions to your Cisco or third-party IP call-control system. Having these devices tightly integrated with the IP-based phone system is advantageous for increased manageability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. The Direct Inward Dialing (DID) port is used to provide off-premises DID connection from the central office. It serves only incoming calls from the PSTN. Caller ID is not supported in DID mode.
Cisco High-Density Analog Voice and Fax Service Modules are available in either a single-wide or double-wide form factor, as depicted in Table 1.

Features and benefits
The new generation of Cisco High-Density Analog Voice and Fax Service Modules improves upon the previous high-density analog and digital extension modules (EVMs). These improvements are highlighted below:
●   On-board Digital Signal Processor (DSP): The FXO and FXS service modules contain an onboard DSP and don’t require the router to have a dedicated packet voice DSP module (PVDM) on the motherboard. The DSP on the voice module is necessary for the voice features. It also provides for echo cancellation of up to 128-ms echo-tail length for demanding network conditions.
●   Support for Online Insertion and Removal (OIR): The FXS and FXO service modules support Online Insertion and Removal (OIR), reducing the downtime required for new or replacement modules. The service modules can be inserted into the SM-X slot on the supported Cisco 4000 Series ISRs without powering off the router.
●   FXS-E (extended loops) support: FXS ports on the new modules support FXS-E with the following details:
◦     Higher loop current (35 mA) to accommodate specialty phones
◦     Longer loop length for loops with 26 AWG wire, up to 11,000 feet (3400 meters)
◦     Higher ringing voltage (65 Vrms, no load)
Refer to Table 2 for the number of FXS-E ports in each module. The SM-X-72FXS module supports two FXS-E modes:
Mode 1 (default): First 16 ports are FXS-E enabled, with the remaining 56 ports as regular FXS.
Mode 2: First 56 ports are FXS-E enabled, with the remaining 16 ports disabled.
Note: Switching between the modes requires reload of the ISR chassis.
●   FXO failover bypass ports: A failover bypass port, also called a failover trunk bypass, provides a way to use designated analog phone ports to make phone calls through the PSTN during a power outage. Table 2 summarizes the supported FXO failover bypass feature in each service module.
In addition to the features listed above, the service modules support:
●   Caller line ID
●   G.711, G.729a, and G.726
●   G722, iLBC, GSMAMR-NB, and Internet Speech Audio Codec (iSAC)
●   Fax detection, pass-through, and relay (T.38)
●   Modem pass-through
●   DTMF detection
●   Echo cancellation
●   Voice activity detection
●   Comfort noise generation
●   Real-Time Control Protocol (RTCP)
●   Acoustic shock protection
●   Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP)
●   RFC 4733 Digit Relay
●   Noise reduction is on the roadmap
The FXS features include:
●   Support for either FXS or DID functionality
●   Message-Waiting Indicator (MWI)
●   Cable detection: GR909 line test
The FXO features include:
●   Support for both ground-start and loop-start modes
●   Call Detail Record (CDR) information
●   Support for interworking with Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Skinny Client Control Protocol [SCCP]), H.323, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) 1.0
●   Cable detection
●   Overload protection

Analog phone connectivity
Cisco High-Density Analog Voice and Fax Service Modules are ideal for analog phone deployments ranging from centralized to sparsely concentrated or distributed topologies. The 4000 Series ISRs offer many supplementary analog calling features, depending on the call control and signaling type used. Table 3 lists the supplementary analog calling features available.

Fax and modem connectivity
FXS ports on the Cisco High-Density Analog Voice and Fax Service Modules support fax machines and modems. When using fax machines, the gateways support T.38 fax relay and fax pass-through. T.38 fax relay technologies allow transfer of faxes across the network with high reliability using less bandwidth than a voice call. All modems can be connected to the SM-X voice and fax modules and are transferred over the network using modem pass-through.
Protocols supported
The voice gateways support the following protocols:
●   SCCP
●   H.323v4
●   MGCP
●   SIP
●   Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP)
●   Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (SRTP)
●   Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)
●   HTTP server
●   Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
●   Telnet
●   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
●   DNS
●   Cisco Unified Communications Manager or Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express redundancy support using Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP)
●   Call survivability: MGCP failover to an H.323 connection to the Survivable Remote Site Telephony (SRST) router
●   T.38 fax relay and modem pass-through
●   Codec support: G.711, and G.729a
●   RADIUS and TACACS+ for Telnet and authorization
