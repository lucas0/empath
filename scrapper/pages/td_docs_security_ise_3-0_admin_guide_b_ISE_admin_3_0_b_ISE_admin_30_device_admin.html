TACACS+ Device Administration
Cisco ISE supports device administration using the TACACS+ security protocol to control and audit the configuration of network devices. The network devices are configured to query Cisco ISE for authentication and authorization of device administrator actions, and send accounting messages for Cisco ISE to log the actions. It facilitates granular control of who can access which network device and change the associated network settings. A Cisco ISE administrator can create policy sets that allow TACACS results, such as command sets and shell profiles, to be selected in authorization policy rules in a device administration access service. The Cisco ISE Monitoring node provides enhanced reports that are related to device administration. The Work Center menu contains all the device administration pages, which act as a single start point for ISE administrators.
Cisco ISE requires a Device Administration license to use TACACS+.
There are two types of administrators for device administration:
Device Administrator
Cisco ISE Administrator
The device administrator is the user who logs into the network devices such as switches, wireless access points, routers, and gateways, (normally through SSH), to perform the configuration and maintenance of the administered devices. The Cisco ISE administrator logs into Cisco ISE to configure and coordinate the devices that a device administrator logs in to.
The Cisco ISE administrator is the intended reader of this document, who logs into Cisco ISE to configure the settings that control the operations of the device administrator. The Cisco ISE administrator uses the device administration features (In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and chooseWork centers > Device Administration) to control and audit the configuration of the network devices. A device can be configured to query the Cisco ISE server using the TACACS security protocol. The Cisco ISE Monitoring node provides enhanced reports that are related to device administration. A Cisco ISE administrator can perform the following tasks:
Configure network devices with the TACACS+ details (shared secret).
Add device administrators as internal users and set their enable passwords as needed.
Create policy sets that allow TACACS results, such as command sets and shell profiles, to be selected in authorization policy rules in a device administration access service.
Configure the TACACS server in Cisco ISE to allow device administrators to access devices based on the policy sets.
The device administrator performs the task of setting up a device to communicate with the Cisco ISE server. When a device administrator logs on to a device, the device queries the Cisco ISE server, which in turn queries an internal or external identity store, to validate the details of the device administrator. When the validation is done by the Cisco ISE server, the device informs the Cisco ISE server of the final outcome of each session or command authorization operation for accounting and auditing purposes.
A Cisco ISE administrator can manage device administration using TACACS and Cisco ISE 2.0 and later releases. The configuration related to device administration can also be migrated from a Cisco Secure Access Control System (ACS) server, versions 5.5, 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8. Earlier versions must be upgraded to 5.5 or 5.6 before migration.

Note
You should check the Enable Device Admin Service check box in the Administration > System > Deployment > General Settings page to enable TACACS+ operations. Ensure that this option is enabled in each PSN in a deployment.
Due to a known limitation of TACACS+ protocol to create a secure connection between switch or router and Cisco ISE, ensure that IP Security protocol is deployed between the two parties.
ISE Community Resource
For information about device administration attributes, see ISE Device Administration Attributes.
For information about TACACS+ configuration for wireless LAN controllers, Cisco IOS network devices, Cisco NX-OS network devices, and network devices, see ISE Device Administration (TACACS+).
Device Administration Work Center
The Work Center menu contains all the device administration pages, which act as a single start point for Cisco ISE administrators. However, pages that are not specific to device administration such as Users, User Identity Groups, Network Devices, Default Network Devices, Network Device Groups, Authentication and Authorization Conditions, can still be accessed from their original menu options, such as Administration. The Work Centers option is available only if the correct TACACS+ license(s) are obtained and installed.
The Device Administration Menu contains the following menu options: Overview, Identities, User Identity Groups, Ext ID Stores, Network Resources, Network Device Groups, Policy Elements, Device Admin Policy Sets, Reports, and Settings.
Device Administration Deployment Settings
The Device Administration Deployment page (In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Work Centers > Device Administration > Overview > Deployment) allows Cisco ISE administrators to centrally view the device administration system without seeing each node in the deployment section.
The Device Administration Deployment page lists the PSNs in your deployment. This simplifies the task of enabling the device admin service individually in each PSN in your deployment. You can collectively enable the device admin service for many PSNs by selecting an option below:
Table 1. List of options in the Device Administration Deployment Window
Option
Description
None
By default, the device administration service is disabled for all nodes.
All Policy Service Nodes
Enables the device administration service in all PSNs. With this option, new PSNs are automatically enabled for device admin when they are added.
Specific Nodes
Displays the ISE Nodes section that lists all the PSNs in your deployment. You can select the required nodes that need the device admin service to be enabled.

Note
If the deployment is not licensed for TACACS+, the above options are disabled.
The TACACS Ports field allows you to enter a maximum of four TCP ports, which are comma-separated and port values range 1–65535. Cisco ISE nodes and their interfaces listen for TACACS+ requests on the specified ports and you must ensure that the specified ports are not used by other services. The default TACACS+ port value is 49.
When you click Save, the changes are synchronized with the nodes that are specified in the Administration > System > Deployment Listing window.
Device Admin Policy Sets
The Device Admin Policy Sets window (In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Work Centers > Device Administration > Device Admin Policy Sets) contains the list of policy sets that a Cisco ISE administrator manages to control the authentication and authorization of TACACS+ Device administrators. Each policy can be in one of two modes: Regular and Proxy Sequence.
A Regular policy set comprises an authentication rule table and an authorization rule table. The authentication rule table contains a set of rules to select actions required to authenticate a network device.
The authorization rule table contains a set of rules to select the specific authorization results required to implement the authorization business model. Each authorization rule consists of one or more conditions that must be matched for the rule to be engaged, and a set of command sets, and/or a shell profile, which are selected to control the authorization process. Each rule table has an exception policy that can be used to override the rules for specific circumstances, often the exception table is used for temporary situations.

Note
TACACS+ CHAP outbound authentication is not supported.
A Proxy Sequence policy set contains a single selected proxy sequence. If the policy set is in this mode then one or more remote proxy servers are used to process the requests (although local accounting may be configured by the Proxy Sequence).
Create Device Administration Policy Sets
To create a device administration policy set:
Before you begin
Ensure that the Device Administration in the Work Centers > Device Administration > Overview > Deployment window is enabled for TACACS+ operations.
Ensure that any User Identity Groups, (for example, System_Admin, Helpdesk) required for the policy are created. (In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Work Centers > Device Administration > User Identity Groups page). Ensure that the member users (for example, ABC, XYZ) are allocated to their corresponding groups. (In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Work Centers > Device Administration > Identities > Users window).
Ensure to configure TACACS settings on devices that must be administered. (In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Work Centers > Device Administration > Network Resources > Network Devices > Add > TACACS Authentication Settings check box is enabled and the shared secret for TACACS and devices are identical to facilitate the devices to query Cisco ISE.)
Ensure that the Network Device Group, based on the Device Type and Location, is created. (In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Work Centers > Device Administration > Network Resources > Network Device Groups window)
Procedure
Step 1
In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Work Centers > Device Administration > Device Admin Policy Sets.
Step 2
From the Actions column on any row, click the cog icon and then from the drop-down list, insert a new policy set by selecting any of the insert or duplicate options, as necessary.
A new row appears in the Policy Sets table.
Step 3
Enter the name and description for the policy set.
Step 4
If necessary, from the Allowed Protocols/Server Sequence column, click the (+) symbol and select one of the following:
Create a New Allowed Protocol
Create a TACACS Server Sequence
Step 5
From the Conditions column, click the (+) symbol.
Step 6
Create the required conditions in the Conditions Studio Page. In the Editor section, click the Click To Add an Attribute text box, and select the required Dictionary and Attribute (for example, Device-Location Equals Europe).
You can drag and drop a Library condition to the Click To Add An Attribute text box.
Step 7
Click Use.
Step 8
From the View column, click to access all the policy set details and to create the authentication and authorization policies as well as policy exceptions.
Step 9
Create the required Authentication policy, (for example, Rule Name: ATN_Internal_Users, Conditions: DEVICE:Location EQUALS Location #All Locations#Europe—The policy matches only devices that are in location Europe).
Step 10
Click Save.
Step 11
Create the required Authorization Policy.
Example 1: Rule Name: Sys_Admin_rule, Conditions: if SysAdmin and TACACS User Equals ABC then cmd_Sys_Admin AND Profile_priv_8—The policy matches system administrators with username ABC and allows the specified commands to be executed and assigns a privilege level of 8.
Example 2: Rule Name: HelpDesk AND TACACS User EQUALS XYZ then cmd_HDesk_show AND cmd_HDesk_ping AND Profile_priv_1—The policy matches system administrators with username XYZ and allows the specified commands to be executed and assigns a privilege level of 1.
In the above examples:
The command sets, cmd_Sys_Admin and cmd_HDesk, are created in the Work Centers > Device Administration > Policy Elements > Results>TACACS Command Sets > Add window.
The TACACS profiles, Profile_Priv_1 and Profile_priv_8, are created in the Work Centers > Device Administration > Policy Elements > Results >TACACS Profiles > Add window.
Note
  You can add IPv4 or IPv6 single address for the Device IP address attribute in the conditions that are used in authentication and authorization policies.
Step 12
Click Save.
TACACS+ Authentication Settings and Shared Secret
The following table describes the fields in the Network Devices window, which you can use to configure TACACS+ authentication settings for a network device. The navigation path is:
(For Network Devices) In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Work Centers > Device Administration > Network Resources > Network Devices > Add > TACACS Authentication Settings.
(For Default Devices) In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Work Centers > Device Administration > Network Resources > Default Devices > TACACS Authentication Settings. See the section "Default Network Device Definition in Cisco ISE" in for more information.
Field Name
Usage Guidelines
Shared Secret
A string of text that is assigned to a network device when TACACS+ protocol is enabled. A user must enter the text before the network device authenticates a username and password. The connection is rejected until the user supplies the shared secret. This is not a mandatory field.
Retired Shared Secret is Active
Displayed when the retirement period is active.
Retire
Retires an existing shared secret instead of ending it. When you click Retire, a message box is displayed. You can either click Yes or No.
Remaining Retired Period
(Available only if you select Yes in the above message box) Displays the default value specified in the following navigation path: In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Work Centers > Device Administration > Settings > Connection Settings > Default Shared Secret Retirement Period. You can change the default values.
This allows a new shared secret to be entered and the old shared secret will remain active for the specified number of days.
End
(Available only if you select Yes in the above message box) Ends the retirement period and terminates the old shared secret.
Enable Single Connect Mode
Check to use a single TCP connection for all TACACS+ communication with the network device. Choose one of the following:
Legacy Cisco Devices
Or, TACACS+ Draft Compliance Single Connect Support. If you disable Single Connect Mode, ISE uses a new TCP connection for every TACACS+ request.
In summary, you can:
Retire the old shared secret by specifying the retirement period as number of days (Range is 1–99) and at the same time set a new shared secret.
Use the old and new shared secrets during the retirement period.
Extend the retirement period before it expires.
Use the old shared secret only until the end of the retirement period.
Terminate the retirement period before it expires (click End and then Submit).

Note
In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > Network Resources > Network Devices > Add window to access the TACACS+ Authentication Settings option.
Device Administration - Authorization Policy Results
Cisco ISE administrators can use the TACACS+ command sets and TACACS+ profiles (policy results) to control the privileges and commands that are granted to a device administrator. The policy works along with the network devices and so prevents accidental or malicious configuration changes that may be done. If such changes occur, you can use the device administration audit reports to track the device administrator who has executed a particular command.
Allowed Protocols in FIPS and Non-FIPS Modes for TACACS+ Device Administration
TACACS+ Command Sets
Create TACACS+ Command Sets
TACACS+ Profile
Allowed Protocols in FIPS and Non-FIPS Modes for TACACS+ Device Administration
There are many allowed authentication protocol services that Cisco ISE offers for creating the policy results. However, authentication protocol services such as PAP/ASCII, CHAP, and MS-CHAPv1, that apply to the TACACS+ protocol, are disabled on FIPS-enabled Cisco ISE appliances for RADIUS. As a result, you cannot enable these protocols in the Policy > Policy Elements > Results > Allowed Protocols window to administer devices, when using a FIPS-enabled (Administration > System Settings > FIPS Mode) Cisco ISE appliance.
To configure PAP/ASCII, CHAP, and MS-CHAPv1 protocols in your device administration policy results, for both FIPS and non-FIPS modes, you must navigate to the Work Centers > Device Administration > Policy Elements > Results > Allowed Protocols window. Only the Default Device Admin allowed protocols setting may be used when FIPS mode is enabled. This option is not allowed in RADIUS.
TACACS+ Command Sets
Command sets enforce the specified list of commands that can be executed by a device administrator. When a device administrator issues operational commands on a network device, Cisco ISE is queried to determine whether the administrator is authorized to issue these commands. This is also referred to as command authorization.
Wildcards and Regex in Command Sets
Command Line and Command Set List Match
Process Rules with Multiple Command Sets
Wildcards and Regex in Command Sets
A command line comprises the command and zero or more arguments. When Cisco ISE receives a command line (request), it handles the command and its arguments in different ways:
It matches the command in the request with the commands that are specified in the command set list using the wildcard matching paradigm.
Example: Sh?? or S*
It matches the arguments in the request with the arguments that are specified in the command set list using regular expressions (regex) matching paradigm.
Example: Show interface[1-4] port[1-9]:tty*
Command Line and Command Set List Match
To match a requested command line to a command set list that contains wildcards and regex:
Iterate over a command set list to detect matching commands.
Wildcard matching permits:
Case insensitivity.
Any character in the command in the command set may be "?", which matches any individual character that must exist in the requested command.
Any character in the command in the command set may be "*", which matches zero or more characters in the requested command.
Examples:
Request
Command Set
Matches
Comments
show
show
Y
—
show
SHOW
Y
Case insensitive
show
Sh??
Y
Matches any character
show
Sho??
N
Second "?" intersects with the character that does not exist
show
S*
Y
"*" matches any character
show
S*w
Y
"*" matches characters "ho"
show
S*p
N
Character "p" does not correspond
For each matching command, Cisco ISE validates the arguments.
The command set list includes a space-delimited set of arguments for each command.
Example: Show interface[1-4] port[1-9]:tty.*
This command has two arguments.
1. Argument 1: interface[1-4]
2. Argument 2: port[1-9]:tty.*
The command arguments in the request are taken in the position-significant order in which they appear in the packet. If all the arguments in the command definition match the arguments in the request, then this command or argument is considered to be a match. Any extraneous arguments in the request are ignored.

Note
Use the standard Unix regular expressions in arguments.
Process Rules with Multiple Command Sets
If a command set contains a match for the command and its arguments, and the match has Deny Always, Cisco ISE designates the command set as Commandset-DenyAlways.
If a command set does not contain a Deny Always for a command match, Cisco ISE checks all the commands in the command set sequentially for the first match.
If the first match has Permit, Cisco ISE designates the command set as Commandset-Permit.
If the first match has Deny, Cisco ISE designates the command set as Commandset-Deny.
After Cisco ISE has analyzed all the command sets, it authorizes the command:
If Cisco ISE designated any command set as Commandset-DenyAlways, Cisco ISE denies the command.
If there is no Commandset-DenyAlways, Cisco ISE permits the command if any command set is Commandset-Permit; otherwise, Cisco ISE denies the command. The only exception is when the Unmatched check box is checked.
Create TACACS+ Command Sets
To create a policy set using the TACACS+ command sets policy results:
Procedure
Step 1
In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Work Centers > Device Administration > Policy Elements > Results > TACACS Command Sets.
You can also configure TACACS command sets in the Work Centers > Device Administration > Device Admin Policy Sets page.
Step 2
Click Add.
Step 3
Enter a name and description.
Step 4
Click Add to specify the Grant permission, Command, and Argument.
Step 5
In the Grant drop-down, you can choose one of the following:
Permit: To allow the specified command, (for example, permit show, permit con* Argument terminal).
Deny: To deny the specified command, (for example, deny mtrace).
Deny Always: To override a command that has been permitted in any other command set, (for example, clear auditlogs)
Note
  Click the action icon to increase or decrease the column width of the Grant, Command, and Argument fields.
Step 6
Check the Permit any command that is not listed below check box to allow commands and arguments that are not specified as Permit, Deny or Deny Always in the Grant column.
TACACS+ Profile
TACACS+ profiles control the initial login session of the device administrator. A session refers to each individual authentication, authorization, or accounting request. A session authorization request to a network device elicits a Cisco ISE response. The response includes a token that is interpreted by the network device, which limits the commands that may be executed during a session. The authorization policy for a device administration access service can contain a single shell profile and multiple command sets. The TACACS+ profile definitions are split into two components:
Common tasks
Custom attributes
There are two views in the TACACS+ Profiles window (In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Work Centers > Device Administration > Policy Elements > Results > TACACS Profiles), Task Attribute View and Raw View. You can enter common tasks using the Task Attribute View and create custom attributes in the Task Attribute View and the Raw View.
The Common Tasks section allows you to select and configure the frequently used attributes for a profile. The attributes that are included here are those defined by the TACACS+ protocol draft specifications. However, the values can be used in the authorization of requests from other services. In the Task Attribute View, the Cisco ISE administrator can set the privileges that will be assigned to the device administrator. The common task types are:
Shell
Cisco WLC
Cisco Nexus
Generic
The Custom Attributes section allows you to configure extra attributes. It provides a list of attributes that are not recognized by the Common Tasks section. Each definition consists of the attribute name, an indication of whether the attribute is mandatory or optional, and the value for the attribute.

Note
You can define a total of 24 task attributes for TACACS-enabled network devices. If you define more than 24 task attributes, none of them are sent to TACACS-enabled network devices.
In the Raw View, you can enter the mandatory attributes using an equal to (=) sign between the attribute name and its value and optional attributes are entered using an asterisk (*) between the attribute name and its value. The attributes that are entered in the Raw View section are reflected in the Custom Attributes section in the Task Attribute View and vice versa. The Raw View section is also used to copy and paste the attribute list (for example, another product's attribute list) from the clipboard onto Cisco ISE. Custom attributes can be defined for nonshell services.

A Cisco ISE administrator can specify the Nexus attributes generated by the common tasks as Optional or Mandatory.
Network Role
When a Nexus is configured to authenticate using Cisco ISE, the device administrator, by default, has read-only access. Device administrators can be assigned to one of these roles. Each role defines the operations that is allowed:
None: No privileges.
Operator (Read Only): Complete read access to the entire NX-OS device.
Administrator (Read/Write): Complete read-and-write access to the entire NX-OS device.
Virtual Device Context (VDC)
None: No privileges.
Operator (Read Only): Read access limited to a VDC
Administrator (Read/Write): Read-and-write access that is limited to a VDC.
Generic
The Cisco ISE administrator uses the option to specify custom attributes that are not available in the common tasks.
Change the Enable Password Through the CLI
To change Enable password, perform the following steps:
Before you begin
Some commands are assigned to privileged mode. Therefore, they can only be executed when the device administrator has authenticated into this mode.
The device sends a special enable authentication type when the device administrator attempts to enter the privileged mode. Cisco ISE supports a separate enable password to validate this special enable authentication type. The separate enable password is used when the device administrator is authenticated with internal identity stores. For authentication with external identity stores, the same password is used as for regular login.
Procedure
Step 1
Log in to the switch.
Step 2
Press Enter to display the following prompt:
Switch>
Step 3
Execute the following commands to configure the Enable password.
Switch> enable
Password: (Press Enter to leave the password blank.)
Enter Old Password: (Enter the old password.)
Enter New Password: (Enter the new password.)
Enter New Password Confirmation: (Confirm the new password.)
Note
  If password lifetime is configured for the Login password and Enable password, the user account will be disabled if the passwords are not changed within the specified time period. If Cisco ISE is configured as TACACS+ server and the Enable Bypass option is configured on the network device, you cannot change the Enable password from the CLI (via telnet). In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > Identity Management > Identities > Users to change the Enable password for internal users.
Configure Global TACACS+ Settings
To configure global TACACS+ settings:
Procedure
Step 1
In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Work Centers > Device Administration > Settings.
In the Connection Settings tab, you can change the default values for the required fields.
In the Authorization cache timeout field, you can set the Time-To-Live (TTL) value for which certain attributes of an internal user are cached upon the first authorization request. The cached attributes include username, and user-specific attributes, such as UserGroup. In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose System Administration > Configuration > Dictionaries > Identity > Internal Users to create attributes. The default value is 0, which means the authorization cache is disabled.
Single Connect Support: If you disable Single Connect Mode, ISE uses a new TCP connection for every TACACS+ request.
Step 2
In the Password Change Control tab, define the required fields to control whether password update is permitted through TACACS+.
The prompts in the Enable Telnet Change Password section are enabled only when this option is selected. Or else, the prompts in the Disable Telnet Change Password are enabled. The password prompts are fully customizable and can be modified as needed.
In the Password Policy Violation Message field, you can display an appropriate error message for the password set by the internal users if the new password does not match the specified criteria.
Step 3
In the Session Key Assignment tab, select the required fields to link TACACS+ requests into a session.
The session key is used by the Monitoring node to link AAA requests from clients. The default settings are for NAS-Address, Port, Remote-Address, and User fields to be enabled.
