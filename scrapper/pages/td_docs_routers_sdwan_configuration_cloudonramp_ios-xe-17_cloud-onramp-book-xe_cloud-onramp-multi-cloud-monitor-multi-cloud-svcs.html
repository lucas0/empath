Information about Monitoring Multicloud Services using Cisco vManage
This feature enables you to monitor Cisco SD-WAN connectivity to different cloud resources using the Cisco vManage UI. This feature introduces the following views in the UI using which you can visually monitor the approximate geographical locations of Edge devices, cloud types, and information about cloud sites and accounts for different cloud providers:
Geographical View
Cloud and Interconnect Dashboard
Cloud Gateway Summary View
Interconnect Gateway Summary View
By default, the Monitor Overview dashboard displays all the available dashlets that help you monitor the different components and services of a Cisco SD-WAN overlay network. The customizable dashboard feature enables you to do the following:
Add dashlets
Delete dashlets
Rearrange dashlets
Restore default settings

Note
Starting from Cisco vManage Release 20.10.1, the Multicloud dashlets on the Monitor Overview dashboard are displayed as soon as the Cloud or Interconnect provider accounts are associated with Cisco vManage.
Geographical View
The geographical view shows the approximate geographic locations of the Cisco Catalyst 8000V instances in multicloud deployments. The approximate locations are based on the publicly available information from the cloud and interconnect types. The locations are provided for the Google Cloud, AWS, and Azure cloud platforms as well as software-defined cloud interconnects.
To view the geographical locations of multicloud Cisco Catalyst 8000V instances:
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Monitor > Geography.
On the map, click a Cisco Catalyst 8000V instance to see the cloud or interconnect type, site-id, and system-ip of that instance.
Cloud and Interconnect Dashboard
The cloud and interconnect dashboard displays a separate panel for each cloud instance and software-defined cloud interconnect. A pie chart shows the sites that are connected to the cloud or the software-defined cloud interconnect and their reachability. The sites are Cisco SD-WAN devices of a particular site-id that have a BFD session to the cloud or interconnect Cisco Catalyst 8000V. Each cloud or interconnect panel also displays the following information:
Number of Cisco SD-WAN edge devices
Registered multicloud accounts
Gateways
Tags
Host VPCs
Tunnels
VPN connections
To view information on the cloud and interconnect dashboard:
From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Monitor > Multicloud.
Cisco vManage Release 20.6.x and earlier: From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Dashboard > Multicloud.
To view information about the Cisco SD-WAN edge devices, click the number of WAN Edges to see information about the Cisco SD-WAN edge devices. The window that is displayed shows the health (aggregate of the CPU, memory, and hardware state), BFD status, configuration status, reachability, hostname, system IP, chassis number, cloud or interconnect gateway name, device model and version of the device.
From Monitor > Multicloud, when you click on the non-zero number of Cloud or Interconnect Edge devices, the Monitor > Devices page opens. The Filter criteria on the left pane of the Devices window allows you to choose the fields to be displayed from the available options.
To view the cloud or software-defined cloud interconnect gateway name, region, account name, health, and description of the all the gateways that are specific to a cloud type, click on the non-zero number of Cloud or Interconnect Gateways.
To view the details of Cloud or Interconnect Edge devices, click on the non-zero number of Cloud or Interconnect Edge.
To view the Connected Sites health, BFD status and site ID, click on the non-zero number of Connected Sites.
