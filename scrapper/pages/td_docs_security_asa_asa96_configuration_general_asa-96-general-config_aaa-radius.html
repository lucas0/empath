About RADIUS Servers for AAA
The Cisco ASA supports the following RFC-compliant RADIUS servers for AAA:
Cisco Secure ACS 3.2, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, and 5.x
Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE)
RSA RADIUS in RSA Authentication Manager 5.2, 6.1, and 7.x
Microsoft

Supported Authentication Methods
The ASA supports the following authentication methods with RADIUS servers:
PAP—For all connection types.
CHAP and MS-CHAPv1—For L2TP-over-IPsec connections.
MS-CHAPv2—For L2TP-over-IPsec connections, and for regular IPsec remote access connections when the password management feature is enabled. You can also use MS-CHAPv2 with clientless connections.
Authentication Proxy modes—For RADIUS-to Active-Directory, RADIUS-to-RSA/SDI, RADIUS- to-Token server, and RSA/SDI-to-RADIUS connections,

Note
To enable MS-CHAPv2 as the protocol used between the ASA and the RADIUS server for a VPN connection, password management must be enabled in the tunnel group general attributes. Enabling password management generates an MS-CHAPv2 authentication request from the ASA to the RADIUS server. See the description of the password-management command for details.
If you use double authentication and enable password management in the tunnel group, then the primary and secondary authentication requests include MS-CHAPv2 request attributes. If a RADIUS server does not support MS-CHAPv2, then you can configure that server to send a non-MS-CHAPv2 authentication request by using the no mschapv2-capable command.
User Authorization of VPN Connections
The ASA can use RADIUS servers for user authorization of VPN remote access and firewall cut-through-proxy sessions using dynamic ACLs or ACL names per user. To implement dynamic ACLs, you must configure the RADIUS server to support them. When the user authenticates, the RADIUS server sends a downloadable ACL or ACL name to the ASA. Access to a given service is either permitted or denied by the ACL. The ASA deletes the ACL when the authentication session expires.
In addition to ACLs, the ASA supports many other attributes for authorization and setting of permissions for VPN remote access and firewall cut-through proxy sessions.
Supported Sets of RADIUS Attributes
The ASA supports the following sets of RADIUS attributes:
Authentication attributes defined in RFC 2138.
Accounting attributes defined in RFC 2139.
RADIUS attributes for tunneled protocol support, defined in RFC 2868.
Cisco IOS Vendor-Specific Attributes (VSAs), identified by RADIUS vendor ID 9.
Cisco VPN-related VSAs, identified by RADIUS vendor ID 3076.
Microsoft VSAs, defined in RFC 2548.
Supported RADIUS Authorization Attributes
Authorization refers to the process of enforcing permissions or attributes. A RADIUS server defined as an authentication server enforces permissions or attributes if they are configured. These attributes have vendor ID 3076.
The following table lists the supported RADIUS attributes that can be used for user authorization.

Note
RADIUS attribute names do not contain the cVPN3000 prefix. Cisco Secure ACS 4.x supports this new nomenclature, but attribute names in pre-4.0 ACS releases still include the cVPN3000 prefix. The ASAs enforce the RADIUS attributes based on attribute numeric ID, not attribute name.
All attributes listed in the following table are downstream attributes that are sent from the RADIUS server to the ASA except for the following attribute numbers: 146, 150, 151, and 152. These attribute numbers are upstream attributes that are sent from the ASA to the RADIUS server. RADIUS attributes 146 and 150 are sent from the ASA to the RADIUS server for authentication and authorization requests. All four previously listed attributes are sent from the ASA to the RADIUS server for accounting start, interim-update, and stop requests. Upstream RADIUS attributes 146, 150, 151, and 152 were introduced in Version 8.4(3).

Guidelines for RADIUS Servers for AAA
This section describes the guidelines and limitations that you should check before configuring RADIUS servers for AAA.
You can have up to 100 server groups in single mode or 4 server groups per context in multiple mode.
Each group can have up to 16 servers in single mode or 4 servers in multiple mode.
IPv6
The AAA server must use an IPv4 address, but endpoints can use IPv6.
Configure RADIUS Servers for AAA
This section describes how to configure RADIUS servers for AAA.
Procedure
Step 1
Load the ASA attributes into the RADIUS server. The method that you use to load the attributes depends on which type of RADIUS server that you are using:
If you are using Cisco ACS: the server already has these attributes integrated. You can skip this step.
For RADIUS servers from other vendors (for example, Microsoft Internet Authentication Service): you must manually define each ASA attribute. To define an attribute, use the attribute name or number, type, value, and vendor code (3076).
Step 2
Configure RADIUS Server Groups.
Step 3
Add a RADIUS Server to a Group.

Configure RADIUS Server Groups
If you want to use an external RADIUS server for authentication, authorization, or accounting, you must first create at least one RADIUS server group per AAA protocol and add one or more servers to each group.
Procedure
Step 1
Create the RADIUS AAA server group.
aaa-server group_name protocol radius
Example:
ciscoasa(config)# aaa-server servergroup1 protocol radius
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-group)#
When you enter the aaa-server protocol command, you enter aaa-server group configuration mode.
Step 2
(Optional.) Specify the maximum number of failed AAA transactions with a RADIUS server in the group before trying the next server.
max-failed-attempts number
The range is from 1 and 5. The default is 3.
If you configured a fallback method using the local database (for management access only), and all the servers in the group fail to respond, or their responses are invalid, then the group is considered to be unresponsive, and the fallback method is tried. The server group remains marked as unresponsive for a period of 10 minutes (by default), so that additional AAA requests within that period do not attempt to contact the server group, and the fallback method is used immediately. To change the unresponsive period from the default, see the reactivation-mode command in the next step.
If you do not have a fallback method, the ASA continues to retry the servers in the group.
Example:
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-group)# max-failed-attempts 2
Step 3
(Optional.) Specify the method (reactivation policy) by which failed servers in a group are reactivated.
reactivation-mode {depletion [deadtime minutes] | timed}
Where:
depletion [deadtime minutes] reactivates failed servers only after all of the servers in the group are inactive. This is the default reactivation mode. You can specify the amount of time, between 0 and 1440 minutes, that elapses between the disabling of the last server in the group and the subsequent reenabling of all servers. The default is 10 minutes.
timed reactivates failed servers after 30 seconds of down time.
Example:
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-group)# reactivation-mode deadtime 20
Step 4
(Optional.) Send accounting messages to all servers in the group.
accounting-mode simultaneous
To restore the default of sending messages only to the active server, enter the accounting-mode single command.
Example:
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-group)# accounting-mode simultaneous
Step 5
(Optional.) Enable the periodic generation of RADIUS interim-accounting-update messages.
interim-accounting-update [periodic [hours]]
ISE maintains a directory of active sessions based on the accounting records that it receives from NAS devices like the ASA. However, if ISE does not receive any indication that the session is still active (accounting message or posture transactions) for a period of 5 days, it will remove the session record from its database. To ensure that long-lived VPN connections are not removed, configure the group to send periodic interim-accounting-update messages to ISE for all active sessions.
periodic [hours] enables the periodic generation and transmission of accounting records for every VPN session that is configured to send accounting records to the server group in question. You can optionally include the interval, in hours, for sending these updates. The default is 24 hours, the range is 1 to 120.
(No parameters.) If you use this command without the periodic keyword, the ASA sends interim-accounting-update messages only when a VPN tunnel connection is added to a clientless VPN session. When this happens the accounting update is generated in order to inform the RADIUS server of the newly assigned IP address.
Example:
hostname(config-aaa-server-group)# interim-accounting-update periodic 12
Step 6
(Optional.) Enable the RADIUS Dynamic Authorization (ISE Change of Authorization, CoA) services for the AAA server group.
dynamic-authorization [port number]
Specifying a port is optional. The default is 1700, the range is 1024 to 65535.
When you use the server group in a VPN tunnel, the RADIUS server group will be registered for CoA notification and the ASA will listen to the port for the CoA policy updates from ISE. Enable dynamic authorization only if you are using this server group in a remote access VPN in conjunction with ISE.
Example:
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-group)# dynamic-authorization
Step 7
(Optional.) If you do not want to use ISE for authentication, enable authorize-only mode for the RADIUS server group. (Enable authorize-only mode only if you are using this server group in a remote access VPN in conjunction with ISE.)
authorize-only
This indicates that when this server group is used for authorization, the RADIUS Access Request message will be built as an “Authorize Only” request as opposed to the configured password methods defined for the AAA server. If you do configure a common password using radius-common-pw command for the RADIUS server, it will be ignored.
For example, you would use authorize-only mode if you want to use certificates for authentication rather than this server group. You would still use this server group for authorization and accounting in the VPN tunnel.
Example:
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-group)# authorize-only
Step 8
(Optional.) Merge a downloadable ACL with the ACL received in the Cisco AV pair from a RADIUS packet.
merge-dacl {before-avpair | after-avpair}
Example:
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-group)# merge-dacl before-avpair
This option applies only to VPN connections. For VPN users, ACLs can be in the form of Cisco AV pair ACLs, downloadable ACLs, and an ACL that is configured on the ASA. This option determines whether or not the downloadable ACL and the AV pair ACL are merged, and does not apply to any ACLs configured on the ASA.
The default setting is no merge dacl , which specifies that downloadable ACLs will not be merged with Cisco AV pair ACLs. If both an AV pair and a downloadable ACL are received, the AV pair has priority and is used.
The before-avpair option specifies that the downloadable ACL entries should be placed before the Cisco AV pair entries.
The after-avpair option specifies that the downloadable ACL entries should be placed after the Cisco AV pair entries.
Examples
The following example shows how to add one RADIUS group with a single server:
ciscoasa(config)# aaa-server AuthOutbound protocol radius
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-group)# exit
ciscoasa(config)# aaa-server AuthOutbound (inside) host 10.1.1.3
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-host)# key RadUauthKey
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-host)# exit
The following example shows how to configure an ISE server group for dynamic authorization (CoA) updates and hourly periodic accounting. Included is the tunnel group configuration that configures password authentication with ISE.
ciscoasa(config)# aaa-server ise protocol radius
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-group)# interim-accounting-update periodic 1
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-group)# dynamic-authorization
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-group)# exit
ciscoasa(config)# aaa-server ise (inside) host 10.1.1.3
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-host)# key sharedsecret
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-host)# exit
ciscoasa(config)# tunnel-group aaa-coa general-attributes
ciscoasa(config-tunnel-general)# address-pool vpn
ciscoasa(config-tunnel-general)# authentication-server-group ise
ciscoasa(config-tunnel-general)# accounting-server-group ise
ciscoasa(config-tunnel-general)# exit
The following example shows how to configure a tunnel group for local certificate validation and authorization with ISE. Include the authorize-only command in the server group configuration, because the server group will not be used for authentication.
ciscoasa(config)# aaa-server ise protocol radius
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-group)# authorize-only
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-group)# interim-accounting-update periodic 1
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-group)# dynamic-authorization
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-group)# exit
ciscoasa(config)# aaa-server ise (inside) host 10.1.1.3
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-host)# key sharedsecret
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-host)# exit
ciscoasa(config)# tunnel-group aaa-coa general-attributes
ciscoasa(config-tunnel-general)# address-pool vpn
ciscoasa(config-tunnel-general)# authentication certificate
ciscoasa(config-tunnel-general)# authorization-server-group ise
ciscoasa(config-tunnel-general)# accounting-server-group ise
ciscoasa(config-tunnel-general)# exit
Add a RADIUS Server to a Group
To add a RADIUS server to a group, perform the following steps:
Procedure
Step 1
Identify the RADIUS server and the AAA server group to which it belongs.
aaa-server server_group [(interface_name)] host server_ip
Example:
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-group)# aaa-server servergroup1 outside host 10.10.1.1
If you do not specify an (interface_name) , then the ASA uses the inside interface by default.
Step 2
Specify how the ASA treats netmasks received in a downloadable ACL from a RADIUS server.
acl-netmask-convert {auto-detect | standard | wildcard}
Example:
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-host)# acl-netmask-convert standard
Theauto-detect keyword specifies that the ASA should attempt to determine the type of netmask expression used. If the ASA detects a wildcard netmask expression, it converts it to a standard netmask expression.
The standard keyword specifies that the ASA assumes downloadable ACLs received from the RADIUS server contain only standard netmask expressions. No translation from wildcard netmask expressions is performed.
The wildcard keyword specifies that the ASA assumes downloadable ACLs received from the RADIUS server contain only wildcard netmask expressions and converts them all to standard netmask expressions when the ACLs are downloaded.
Step 3
Specify a common password to be used for all users who are accessing a RADIUS authorization server through the ASA.
radius-common-pw string
Example:
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-host)# radius-common-pw examplepassword123abc
The string argument is a case-sensitive, alphanumeric keyword of up to 127 characters to be used as a common password for all authorization transactions with the RADIUS server.
Step 4
Enable MS-CHAPv2 authentication requests to the RADIUS server.
mschapv2-capable
Example:
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-host)# mschapv2-capable
Step 5
Specify the timeout value for connection attempts to the server.
timeout seconds
Specify the timeout interval (1-300 seconds) for the server; the default is 10 seconds. For each AAA transaction the ASA retries connection attempts (based on the interval defined on the retry-interval command) until the timeout is reached. If the number of consecutive failed transactions reaches the limit specified on the max-failed-attempts command in the AAA server group, the AAA server is deactivated and the ASA starts sending requests to another AAA server if it is configured.
Example:
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-host)# timeout 15
Step 6
Configure the amount of time between retry attempts for a particular AAA server designated in a previous command.
retry-interval seconds
Example:
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-host)# retry-interval 8
The seconds argument specifies the retry interval (1-10 seconds) for the request. This is the time that the ASA waits before retrying a connection request.
Note 
For the RADIUS protocol, if the server responds with an ICMP Port Unreachable message, the retry-interval setting is ignored and the AAA server is immediately moved to the failed state. If this is the only server in the AAA group, it is reactivated and another request is sent to it. This is the intended behavior.
Step 7
Send accounting messages to all servers in the group.
accounting-mode simultaneous
Example:
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-group)# accounting-mode simultaneous
Enter the accounting-mode single command to restore the default of sending messages only to the active server.
Step 8
Specify the authentication port as port number1645, or the server port to be used for authentication of users.
authentication-port port
Example:
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-host)# authentication-port 1646
Step 9
Specify the accounting port as port number 1646, or the server port to be used for accounting for this host.
accounting-port port
Example:
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-host)# accounting-port 1646
Step 10
Specify the server secret value used to authenticate the RADIUS server to the ASA. The server secret that you configure should match the one configured on the RADIUS server. If you do not know the server secret value, ask the RADIUS server administrator. The maximum length is 64 characters.
key
Example:
ciscoasa(config-aaa-host)# key myexamplekey1
The server secret that you configure should match the one configured on the RADIUS server. If you do not know the server secret value, ask the RADIUS server administrator. The maximum length is 64 characters.
Example
The following example shows how to add a RADIUS server to an existing RADIUS server group:
ciscoasa(config)# aaa-server svrgrp1 protocol radius
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-group)# aaa-server svrgrp1 host 192.168.3.4
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-host)# acl-netmask-convert wildcard
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-host)# radius-common-pw myexaplepasswordabc123
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-host)# mschapv2-capable
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-host)# timeout 9
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-host)# retry-interval 7
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-host)# accounting-mode simultaneous
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-host)# authentication-port 1650
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-host)# authorization-port 1645
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-host)# key mysecretkeyexampleiceage2
ciscoasa(config-aaa-server-host)# exit
ciscoasa(config)#
Monitoring RADIUS Servers for AAA

Describes how to configure RADIUS servers for AAA.
We introduced the following commands:
aaa-server protocol, max-failed-attempts, reactivation-mode, accounting-mode simultaneous, aaa-server host, show aaa-server, show running-config aaa-server, clear aaa-server statistics, authentication-port, accounting-port, retry-interval, acl-netmask-convert, clear configure aaa-server, merge-dacl, radius-common-pw, key.
Key vendor-specific attributes (VSAs) sent in RADIUS access request and accounting request packets from the ASA
8.4(3)
Four New VSAs—Tunnel Group Name (146) and Client Type (150) are sent in RADIUS access request packets from the ASA. Session Type (151) and Session Subtype (152) are sent in RADIUS accounting request packets from the ASA. All four attributes are sent for all accounting request packet types: Start, Interim-Update, and Stop. The RADIUS server (for example, ACS and ISE) can then enforce authorization and policy attributes or use them for accounting and billing purposes.
