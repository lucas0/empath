Introduction
This document provides guidance to customers on how to find the most suitable SD-WAN software for Cisco SD-WAN controllers and Edge routers, which includes vEdge and Cisco IOSÂ® XE SD-WAN devices. The information in this document is not meant to be exhaustive and is intended to serve as a general guide to customers, especially in cases of mass deployments/upgrades. Beyond these recommendations, if customers are required to run a release to utilize newer software features or hardware, the recommendation is to select Extended Maintenance release trains wherever possible.
Background Information
It covers these software/components:
vManage
Controllers (vBond, vSmart hosted in private and public clouds)
Viptela OS (for vEdge100, vEdge1000, vEdge2000, vEdge5000, vEdge-Cloud, and ISR1100-4G/6G)
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN
Cisco performs extensive internal testing and then evaluates software quality after publishing for general availability before making a recommended release. It includes the review of any new defects filed or found against the release, severity or impact of those, as well as general field feedback. This evaluation happens for each new release.
Cisco SD-WAN Software Support Lifecycle
Each Cisco SD-WAN software release is classified as either a Standard Maintenance release or an Extended Maintenance release. This applies to WAN Edge and controller software.
Standard Maintenance Release - A sustaining support lifetime of 12 months from First Customer Shipment (FCS) with scheduled rebuilds. Examples are Cisco IOS XE Software Releases 16.9, 16.11, 17.2, 17.4, 17.5, 17.7 and 17.8 For controllers/vEdges, examples are 18.3, 19.1, 20.1, 20.4, 20.5, 20.7 and 20.8
Extended Maintenance Release - A sustaining support lifetime of 36 months from FCS with scheduled rebuilds. Examples are Cisco IOS XE Software Releases 16.10, 16.12, 17.3, 17.6 and 17.9 For controllers/vEdges, examples are 18.4, 19.2, 20.3, 20.6 and 20.9
Release 18.4/16.10 was the first Extended Maintenance SD-WAN release. Starting from Release 19.2/16.12 every subsequent third release will be an Extended Maintenance release (for example, 19.2/16.12, 17.3/20.3, 17.6/20.6)
Given that Standard Maintenance releases have much shorter support lifetimes whereas Extended Maintenance releases have longer support with more scheduled rebuilds / bug fixes, it is recommended that customers stay on Extended Maintenance releases wherever possible.
