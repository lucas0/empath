The Cisco ® Interface Flexibility (I-Flex) design combines shared port adapters (SPAs) and SPA interface processors (SIPs), taking advantage of an extensible design that helps enable service prioritization for voice, video, and data services. Enterprise and service provider customers can take advantage of improved slot economics resulting from modular port adapters that are interchangeable across Cisco routing platforms. The Cisco I-Flex design maximizes connectivity options and offers superior service intelligence through programmable interface processors that deliver line-rate performance. Cisco I-Flex enhances speed-to-service revenue and provides a rich set of quality of service (QoS) features for premium service delivery while effectively reducing the overall cost of ownership. This data sheet contains the specifications for the Cisco 2-, 5-, 8-, and 10-Port Gigabit Ethernet Shared Port Adapters, Version 2 (Figures 1, 2, and 3).

Product Overview
The Cisco 2-, 5-, 8-, and 10-Port Gigabit Ethernet SPAs are available on high-end Cisco routing platforms, offering the benefits of network scalability with lower initial costs and ease of upgrades. The Cisco SPA/SIP portfolio continues the company's focus on investment protection along with consistent feature support, broad interface availability, and the latest technology. The Cisco SPA/SIP portfolio allows deployment of different interfaces (Packet over SONET/SDH [PoS], ATM, Ethernet, etc.) on the same interface processor.
Figure 2. Cisco 5-Port Gigabit Ethernet SPA
Gigabit Ethernet interfaces are commonly used for interconnecting routers or other devices within a central office or data center or in a metropolitan-area network (MAN). Cisco offers an extensive variety of 1000BASE-X Gigabit Ethernet SPAs to meet customers' needs for various applications. With Cisco Gigabit Ethernet SPAs, you can mix-and-match SPA ports with other types of interfaces in the same slot. Each SPA provides standards-based Gigabit Ethernet implementation for compatibility and interoperability.
Figure 3. Cisco 2-Port Gigabit Ethernet SPA
In addition to the two Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP)-based Gigabit Ethernet ports, two additional built-in RJ-45 ports are provided on the 2-port Gigabit Ethernet SPA, Version 2. A combination of these Gigabit Ethernet ports is permitted, limited to a total of 2 Gigabit Ethernet ports (both copper, both optical, or one copper and one optical).
Applications
The Cisco Gigabit Ethernet SPAs can be used in multiple applications, including:
• Inter- and intra-point of presence (POP) aggregation
• Residential triple play (data, voice, and video)
• Metro Ethernet services
• Converged residential and business services
• Internet peering
Key Features and Benefits
The Cisco SPA/SIP portfolio offers many advantages, including:
• Industry's most modular, flexible, intelligent interface processors:
– Unmatched flexibility, providing mix-and-match capability of interface types on the same interface processor for consistent services, independent of access technology
– Pioneering programmable interface processors that provide flexibility for the service diversity required in next-generation networks
– Innovative design that provides intelligent delivery of services without compromising on performance
• Increased speed-to-service revenue:
– The future-proof programmable Cisco architecture extended to 10 Gbps dramatically improves customer density, increasing potential revenue per platform.
– Interface breadth (copper, channelized, PoS, ATM, and Ethernet) on a modular interface processor allows service providers to more quickly roll out new services, helping ensure that all customers receive consistent, secure, and guaranteed services.
– High-density SFP interfaces are featured for high-port-count applications with reach flexibility. Future optical technology improvements can be adopted using existing SPAs.
• Dramatically improved financials of your routing purchase:
– Improved slot economics and increased density reduce capital expenditures (CapEx).
– The ability to easily add new interfaces as they are needed helps enable a "pay-as-you-grow" business model while still offering a high-density solution.
– SPAs are shared across multiple platforms, and can be easily moved from one to another, providing consistent feature support, accelerated product delivery, and a significant reduction in operating expenses (OpEx) through common sparing as service needs change.

LED indicators
SPA status: Bicolor green and amber LEDs encode the SPA status as follows:
• LED off: SPA is powered off
• LED amber: SPA is powered on and initializing
• LED green: SPA is powered on and operational
In addition to the status LED, the SPAs also have a bicolor, surface-mount, right-angle LED dedicated to each port to indicate port status. The green and amber LEDs encode the port status as follows:
• LED off: Port is not enabled by software
• LED: Port is enabled by software, but there is a problem with the Ethernet link
• LED green: Port is enabled by software, and there is a valid Ethernet link
