Browser Settings for Finesse Desktop
To ensure that all features of the Cisco Finesse agent and supervisor desktop work properly, you must disable popup blockers from the supported browsers.
Please revisit the versions in the release specific Comp Max.
Sign In to Cisco Finesse Desktop
The administrator can set up custom security banner message and custom logon message for Finesse Desktop users. Both the message types can be configured at the same time. The custom logon message can be used to configure the logon banner commonly across all processes that support the feature.
If your administrator has defined a custom security banner message, the message is displayed at the bottom of the Finesse desktop Sign In page. If your administrator has defined a custom logon message, the message is displayed in a pop-up dialog box after you click Sign In. You must acknowledge the custom logon message to sign in.

Note
Custom logon message is not displayed for SSO users.
Procedure
Step 1
In the address bar of your browser, enter https://FQDN of Finesse Server: 8445/desktop, where FQDN of Finesse Server is the fully qualified domain name of the Cisco Finesse server.
Step 2
If your contact center has installed a language pack for Cisco Finesse, on first login, a language selector screen appears on the desktop. From the language selector drop-down, choose the language that you want to appear on the desktop. Click Next.
Note
  You can also select a language by passing the locale as part of the URL (for example, https://FQDN of Primary Server:8445/desktop?locale=fr_FR) or by changing your browser preferred language. The default language is English (en_US).
If your contact center does not have a language pack installed for Cisco Finesse, the desktop locale is English only.
Step 3
In the Username field, enter your Agent ID or user ID.
Note
  User IDs are case-sensitive and can contain numbers (0-9), hyphens (-), underscores (_), and periods (.). User IDs are assigned to you by your administrator and cannot begin or end with a period or contain two periods in a row.
Cisco Finesse agent usernames are restricted to 7-bit printable ASCII characters (any of the 94 characters with the numeric values from 33 to 126). The supported characters are: A-Z and 0-9,,,-,!, ~,`,$,^,&,(,),",',{,},@,.. The following characters are not supported: /, \, [,],:,;,|, =,,,+, *,?, <, >.
Step 4
In the Password field, enter your password.
Step 5
In the Extension field, enter the extension of your phone.
Step 6
Click Sign In.
Note
  The Sign In button is enabled once the username, password, and extension fields are entered. If any field is incomplete, the Sign In button remains disabled.
For non-SSO users, a dialog with the message appears when you (agent, supervisor, administrator) click the Sign In button.
If sign in fails due to device errors the desktop attempts to automatically sign in again. An alert is displayed detailing the number of remaining retries and the time left for the next retry attempt.
If your administrator has enabled the device selection feature for you, the devices associated to your extension are displayed in Select Your Preferred Device screen. For more information see Agent Device Selection. Even if an agent has signed into only one device, this screen is displayed. Therefore, this screen offers a chance to determine if an agent has missed logging into the selected device and thereby retrying the login.
To change the language that appears on your desktop, use the Change the Language link. On the language selector screen, choose the language.
You are signed in to the Cisco Finesse desktop and your status is set to Not Ready. On clicking the user options on the top right corner, your role (agent or supervisor), agent name, agent ID, extension, and mobile number appear in the drop-down.
Note
  When you log in to the Finesse desktop for the first time, you are prompted to set your preference for notifications. Choose the option to always receive or allow toaster notifications. Toaster notifications will not appear if your browser is set to private mode that is New incognito window in Chrome, or New private window in Firefox.

Agent Device Selection
When you (agents and supervisors) need to use different devices that are configured with the same extension, the administrator must enable the Agent Device Selection feature for you. You can select one of the endpoints (Desk Phone with Extension Mobility, Desk Phone without Extension Mobility, Jabber, and so on) on the shared Automatic Call Distribution (ACD) lines as your active device while signing in to the Finesse desktop. This informs the solution to ignore the other devices and use the indicated device as the only source for call interaction. This allows effective control of the call irrespective of from where you connect to the system. You can switch the active device based on where you are workingâ€”across shifts, moving from one office to another across various locations, or working from home.
When you sign in with the desired extension, the Select Your Preferred Device screen displays a list of devices that share the same extension. You can refresh the list of devices (if the required device is not listed) and select the device that you want to use as the active device for the current desktop session.

Note
When the Agent Device Selection feature is enabled, both primary and secondary extensions can be shared with multiple devices. However, ensure that the devices using the shared extensions are not used at the same time.
Procedure
Step 1
Sign in to the Finesse desktop.
If your administrator has enabled the Agent Device Selection feature, the devices sharing your extension are displayed in Select Your Preferred Device screen.
Select Your Preferred Device screen displays the shared devices in your extension in the following format: Device Type (Device Name). For example, Cisco 6940 (SEP0000BCCER9876).
Note
  If you have already signed in to Cisco Unified ICM, signing in to Cisco Finesse or refreshing the Finesse desktop after sign in does not show Select Your Preferred Device screen. You must explicitly sign out from the Finesse desktop and sign in again.
To change the device selection, you must explicitly sign out from Finesse desktop and sign in again.
Step 2
Click the device name to select your preferred device.
To access the Finesse desktop Sign In page, click Back. When you click the Back button on the browser, the page refreshes and you are retained on the same Select Your Preferred Device screen. However, if you had selected any device, the selection is lost.
Note
  Finesse desktop retains your selection only when you click Continue.
When the Finesse desktop fails over, the reconnection banner shows the active device that is selected for the new session, which is the same as the device selected before the failover.
Note
  If the required device is not listed, check whether the extension used to sign in (displayed in the Select Your Preferred Device screen) is valid and if you have signed in to the device. After you have signed in to the required device, click Refresh.
When you place the pointer on the truncated (because of space constraints) device name, a tool tip appears to detail the complete information of the device like device type and device name.
The supported resolution for the Finesse desktop is 1366 x 768 or higher for the optimal viewing of the Select Your Preferred Device screen.
The maximum number of devices that are listed in Select Your Preferred Device screen is five.
If you have signed into more than five devices, and your preferred device is not listed, sign out from devices that are not required. Click Refresh in Select Your Preferred Device screen to update the displayed list of devices.
When you sign in, the browser saves the device that is selected for that agent and the extension used. On subsequent sign-in of the same agent with the same extension, on the same machine, through the same browser, that device will be displayed as the first in the preferred device selection screen.
Step 3
Click Continue.
The selected device is listed under the user options icon on the top-right corner of your screen.
Note
  To change the device selection, sign out from Finesse desktop and sign in again.
Note
  Enabling automatic device selection is supported when a single active device is available for the extension at the time of sign in. For more information, see Enable Automatic Device Selection for Single Active Device in Cisco Finesse Administration Guide at https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/customer-collaboration/finesse/series.html#MaintainandOperate

The remaining steps of the sign-in procedure remain the same for IPv6.
Account Locked After Five Failed Sign In Attempts
If you try to sign in to Finesse with the wrong password for five times in a row, Finesse blocks access to your account for five minutes. For security reasons, if you try to sign in again during that time, Finesse does not alert you that your account is locked. You must wait five minutes and try again. Do not attempt to sign in again when your account is locked, otherwise the lockout timer resets, and you must wait an additional five minutes.
This restriction applies regardless of how you sign in.
Sign In as Mobile Agent
When you sign in as a mobile agent, you can use any phone (home phone or mobile phone) that is accessible to the contact center phone system to receive calls.
For more information about using the mobile agent feature, see the Cisco Webex Contact Center Enterprise Features Guide Features Guide.
Procedure
Step 1
In the address bar of your browser, enter https://FQDN of Finesse Server: 8445/desktop, where FQDN of Finesse Server is the fully qualified domain name of the Cisco Finesse server.

In Nailed Connection mode, your phone is called when you sign in and the line stays connected through multiple customer calls.
Step 5
In the Dial Number field, enter your phone number and click Sign In.
Note
  If sign in fails due to device errors the desktop attempts to automatically sign in again. An alert is displayed detailing the number of remaining retries and the time left for the next retry attempt.
Agent device selection is not applicable for mobile agents.
In Nailed Connection mode, the desktop must receive and answer a setup call before sign-in is complete.
You are signed into the Cisco Finesse desktop and your status is set to Not Ready. On clicking the user options on the top right corner, your role (agent or supervisor), agent name, agent ID, extension, and mobile number appear in the drop-down.
When you select the Sign in as a Mobile Agent check box and choose a mode (Call by Call or Nailed Connection), Finesse stores a cookie in your browser that allows the browser to remember these selections. When you access the sign-in page again, the Sign in as a Mobile Agent check box and Mode are already selected. These selections persist across sign-ins, browser restarts, and failover scenarios.
However, if you access the alternate Finesse server directly and you have not signed in to this server as a mobile agent before, you must make these selections again.
