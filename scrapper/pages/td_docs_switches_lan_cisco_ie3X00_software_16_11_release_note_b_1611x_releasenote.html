Known Issues
This section contains information about the known issues in this release.
IGMP Snooping and Unregistered Multicast Packet Forwarding
Symptoms: Although the mrouter port is configured and multicast receivers have sent igmp-joins to listen to registered multicast streams, unknown multicast streams that ingress the switch are forwarded to all the ports. The flooding may lead to reduction in bandwidth for registered multicast traffic.
Conditions: The issue occurs when the switch receives unregistered multicast packets with a pure L2 configuration and an external IGMP snooping querier is configured on the VLAN. There should not be a membership join received on any VLAN ports.
Workaround: To stop the VLAN, execute the command switchport block multicast on that interface, as shown in the following example:
Switch#configure terminal
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
Switch(config)#interface gigabitEthernet 1/10
Switch(config-if)#switchport block ?        
  multicast  Block unknown multicast addresses
  unicast    Block unknown unicast addresses
 
Switch(config-if)#switchport block mu
Switch(config-if)#switchport block multicast
