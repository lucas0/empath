Objective
This article provides you instructions on how to upgrade FindIT Network Manager to version 2.0.
Introduction
Cisco FindIT Network Management provides tools that help you easily monitor, manage, and configure your Cisco 100 to 500 Series network devices such as switches, routers, and wireless access points (WAPs) using your web browser. FindIT Network Manager is a distributed application which is comprised of two separate components or interfaces: a single manager, called FindIT Network Manager and one or more probes, referred to as FindIT Network Probe. The FindIT Network Manager & Probe provide a complete network management solution for your network, with discovery, monitoring and reporting capabilities. These also include Cisco Support notifications such as availability of new firmware, device status, network settings updates, and a list of any connected devices that are no longer under warranty or covered by a support contract. Check out the device support list to find out about the hardware currently supported by Cisco FindIT Network Manager.
Important Note: When upgrading from FindIT 1.1 to FindIT 2.0, the manager must be upgraded first, then the probes. This way, in the 1.1 to 2.0 upgrade process, the manager is able to download the probe’s device groups, configuration profiles, inventory, device details, and credentials.
The manager controls the import operation from the probe during the upgrade process. The only way the manager knows the probe is upgrading is if an upgrade is executed from the manager User Interface (UI).

Upgrading to Version 2.0
Step 1. Log in to the administration graphical user interface (GUI) of your FindIT Network Manager.
Note: As a reminder, the login banner of the manager will display the IP address to be entered into the browser bar.
Step 2. When there is an update available, the manager will display a green cloud with a down arrow on the about icon (‘i’ symbol) in the header. Click the i icon.
Step 3. Select the radio button next to the Manager. Click Upgrade. The manager will download and apply the update.
Note: The manager can also be upgraded manually by downloading the file and running the installer from the terminal. See the Administration Guide for more details.
Step 4. Once the manager upgrade is complete, you can proceed to upgrading the probes. This is done in the same FindIT Network Manager pop-up window as in the image below.
Note: DO NOT log into the probe to upgrade as the data will be lost. The probe pop-up window will display ‘FindIT Network Probe’. If you see this, log out of the probe and return to the manager.
Step 5: When you click to upgrade the probes, you will be asked to confirm that you want to continue with the upgrade. After confirming, you will then see the following message:
If you click Yes, the configuration profiles and device groups will be imported from the probe into the manager. Imported profiles and groups will have their name prefixed with the network name in order to distinguish groups imported from different probes.
After clicking Yes or Skip, an upgrade job will be created and each of the probes will be updated to version 2.0.
Conclusion
You have now successfully updated your FindIT Network Manager solution to version 2.0. Click on the respective about icons of the manager and probe to verify the versions that are installed.
