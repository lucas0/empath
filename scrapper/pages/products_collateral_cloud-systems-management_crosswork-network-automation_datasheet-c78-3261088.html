    Accedian Skylight Sensors and Skylight Performance Analytics create automated visibility of end-to-end performance of multivendor network services. This enables real-time SLA monitoring, proactive performance troubleshooting, and accurate performance analysis with a single-pane-of-glass GUI and API, fully integrated into the Crosswork ecosystem.
Product overview
To stay competitive, network operators must offer differentiated services based on the performance of their networks – with 5G and private 5G, data center interconnect, business and cloud services, and more, the value proposition of the network rests on how well it performs. This requires automated visibility of service performance built into the design of the network, enabling critical business outcomes:
●      Real-time SLA visibility to internal and customer stakeholders.
●      Proactively ensure the network performs to specification.
●      Rapidly diagnose root causes of network performance issues.
●      Reduce the operational cost of managing complex networks.
Accedian Skylight Sensors and Skylight Performance Analytics, complement Crosswork Network Controller enabling automated performance assurance and closed-loop automation. Now, Crosswork Network Controller can drive automation decisions based on real-time network performance information.
Skylight Sensors can be automatically configured in the network via Network Orchestra. Raw data is collected, and then streamed back to Skylight Performance Analytics, where it is correlated, analyzed and made available via a GUI and APIs for real-time visibility into network performance.
Skylight Performance Analytics can also ingest other sources of performance data either directly from the network or via Crosswork Data Gateway to combine and correlate with data from Skylight Sensors to deliver a single-pane-of-glass view of network performance.
Figure 1.            
Skylight Sensors and Performance Analytics provide high-resolution monitoring for Layers 2 and 3, forming a foundation for advanced assurance automation.
Using Skylight Sensors and Performance Analytics, you can achieve the following outcomes:
●      Reduced operational costs and a more dynamic network through automated deployment of service assurance.
●      For internal users: improved network quality and agility through proactive monitoring and the ability to troubleshoot performance issues quickly.
●      For external users: improved customer satisfaction and reduced churn through complete network and SLA visibility.
Features and benefits

Get an accurate view of network performance across all layers, in both directions, building a statistical model of network performance with accurate packet generation parameters that ensure the probe data reflects real network conditions
Millisecond-level probe visibility and microsecond-level probe accuracy
Detect performance issues that other solutions miss, with a level of accuracy needed for the most high-performance networks
End-to-end service and network performance visibility
Combine and correlate probe data across transport services and networks to get an aggregated view of end-to-end performance
Multivendor performance visibility
Deploy probes across heterogenous networks with equipment from any vendor
Single pane of glass for network performance data
See all probe data correlated with other sources of network performance data in a single GUI and API
Southbound API for performance data ingestion, integrated into CNC
Automate the collection of other sources of performance data, from CNC or from other network sources
Northbound API for performance data and alert sharing, integrated into CNC
Share performance data and alerts with CNC and with other systems to enable closed-loop automation based on network performance
Prominent feature
Skylight Sensors and Skylight Performance Analytics make it easy for network operators to proactively ensure network quality while offering it as a revenue generator. This is enabled by differentiated features such as:
●      Automatically deployed probes in software or various hardware form factors, enabling end-to-end visibility in a wide variety of multivendor network configurations.
●      Accurate and granular probe data from L2 to L3, creating visibility down to the millisecond level for detecting transient problems with big performance impact.
●      Automatic correlation of probe data across layers, combined with other performance data sources, to provide a single-pane-of-glass-view of network performance.
●      API-driven automation for performance visibility—automatically deployed in the network and with performance data shared between systems.
●      Seamlessly complemented with Cisco Crosswork Network Controller to quickly enable performance visibility and closed- loop automation remediation action.
Licensing
Billing terms and overage are explained in the license agreement.
Licenses are sold based on the number of concurrent probe sessions (for active probing) or number of IP addresses (for passive probing/capture). This license usage is tracked by the application in real time.
Usage can be checked via the application at any time. Assurance Sensors reports on license compliance regularly and will generate a quote when there is an overage.
