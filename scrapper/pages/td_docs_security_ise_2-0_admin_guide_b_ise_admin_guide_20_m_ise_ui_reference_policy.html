Field Name
Usage Guidelines
Name
Enter the name of the endpoint profiling policy that you want to create.
Description
Enter the description of the endpoint profiling policy that you want to create.
Policy Enabled
By default, the Policy Enabled check box is checked to associate a matching profiling policy when you profile an endpoint.
When unchecked, the endpoint profiling policy is excluded when you profile an endpoint.
Minimum Certainty Factor
Enter the minimum value that you want to associate with the profiling policy. The default value is 10.
Exception Action
Choose an exception action, which you want to associate with the conditions when defining a rule in the profiling policy.
The default is NONE. The exception actions are defined in the following location: Policy > Policy Elements > Results > Profiling > Exception Actions.
Network Scan (NMAP) Action
Choose a network scan action from the list, which you want to associate with the conditions when defining a rule in the profiling policy, if required.
The default is NONE. The exception actions are defined in the following location: Policy > Policy Elements > Results > Profiling > Network Scan (NMAP) Actions.
Create an Identity Group for the policy
Check one of the following options to create an endpoint identity group:
Yes, create matching Identity Group
No, use existing Identity Group hierarchy
Yes, create matching Identity Group
Choose this option to use an existing profiling policy.
This option creates a matching identity group for those endpoints and the identity group will be the child of the Profiled endpoint identity group when an endpoint profile matches an existing profiling policy.
For example, the Xerox-Device endpoint identity group is created in the Endpoints Identity Groups page when endpoints discovered on your network match the Xerox-Device profile.
No, use existing Identity Group hierarchy
Check this check box to assign endpoints to the matching parent endpoint identity group using hierarchical construction of profiling policies and identity groups.
This option allows you to make use of the endpoint profiling policies hierarchy to assign endpoints to one of the matching parent endpoint identity groups, as well as to the associated endpoint identity groups to the parent identity group.
For example, endpoints that match an existing profile are grouped under the appropriate parent endpoint identity group. Here, endpoints that match the Unknown profile are grouped under Unknown, and endpoints that match an existing profile are grouped under the Profiled endpoint identity group. For example,
If endpoints match the Cisco-IP-Phone profile, then they are grouped under the Cisco-IP-Phone endpoint identity group.
If endpoints match the Workstation profile, then they are grouped under the Workstation endpoint identity group.
The Cisco-IP-Phone and Workstation endpoint identity groups are associated to the Profiled endpoint identity group in the system.
Parent Policy
Choose a parent profiling policy that are defined in the system to which you want to associate the new endpoint profiling policy.
You can choose a parent profiling policy from which you can inherit rules and conditions to its child.
Associated CoA Type
Choose one of the following CoA types that you want to associate with the endpoint profiling policy:
No CoA
Port Bounce
Reauth
Global Settings that is applied from the profiler configuration set in Administration > System > Settings > Profiling
Rules

ID
Enter the vendor attribute ID. The valid range is 0 to 255.
Allow Tagging
Check this check box to mark the attribute as being permitted to have a tag, as defined in RFC2868. The purpose of the tag is to allow grouping of attributes for tunnelled users. See RFC2868 for more details.
The tagged attributes support ensures that all attributes pertaining to a given tunnel contain the same value in their respective tag fields, and that each set includes an appropriately-valued instance of the Tunnel-Preference attribute. This conforms to the tunnel attributes that are to be used in a multi-vendor network environment, thereby eliminating interoperability issues among Network Access Servers (NASs) manufactured by different vendors.
Allow Multiple Instances of this Attribute in a Profile
Check this check box when you want multiple instances of this RADIUS vendor specific attribute in profiles.

Allowed Protocols
The following table describes the fields in the Allowed Protocols window, which allows you to configure the protocols to be used during authentication. The navigation path is Policy > Policy Elements > Results > Authentication > Allowed Protocols.
Table 19. Allowed Protocols
Field Name
Usage Guidelines
Allowed Protocols > Authentication Bypass
Process Host Lookup
Check this check box if you want Cisco ISE to process the Host Lookup request. The Host Lookup request is processed for PAP/CHAP protocol when the RADIUS Service-Type equals 10 (Call-Check) and the username is equal to Calling-Station-ID. The Host Lookup request is processed for EAP-MD5 protocol when the Service-Type equals 1 (Framed) and the username is equal to Calling-Station-ID. Uncheck this check box if you want Cisco ISE to ignore the Host Lookup request and use the original value of the system username attribute for authentication. When unchecked, message processing is done according to the protocol (for example, PAP).
Note 
Disabling this option could result in the failure of existing MAB authentications.
Allowed Protocols > Authentication Protocols
Allow PAP/ASCII
This option enables PAP/ASCII. PAP uses cleartext passwords (that is, unencrypted passwords) and is the least secure authentication protocol.
Allow CHAP
This option enables CHAP authentication. CHAP uses a challenge-response mechanism with password encryption. CHAP does not work with Microsoft Active Directory.
Allow MS-CHAPv1
Check this check box to enable MS-CHAPv1.
Allow MS-CHAPv2
Check this check box to enable MS-CHAPv2.
Allow EAP-MD5
Check this check box to enable EAP-based MD5 password hashed authentication.
Allow EAP-TLS
Check this check box to enable EAP-TLS Authentication protocol and configures EAP-TLS settings. You can specify how Cisco ISE will verify the user identity as presented in the EAP identity response from the end-user client. User identity is verified against information in the certificate that the end-user client presents. This comparison occurs after an EAP-TLS tunnel is established between Cisco ISE and the end-user client.
Note 
EAP-TLS is a certificate-based authentication protocol. EAP-TLS authentication can occur only after you have completed the required steps to configure certificates.
Allow authentication of expired certificates to allow certificate renewal in Authorization Policy: Check this check box, if you want to allow users to renew certificates. If you check this check box, ensure that you configure appropriate authorization policy rules to check if the certificate has been renewed before processing the request any further.
Allow LEAP
Check this check box to enable Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP) authentication.
Allow PEAP
Check this check box to enable PEAP authentication protocol and PEAP settings. The default inner method is MS-CHAPv2.
When you check the Allow PEAP check box, you can configure the following PEAP inner methods:
Allow EAP-MS-CHAPv2: Check this check box to use EAP-MS-CHAPv2 as the inner method.
Allow Password Change: Check this check box for Cisco ISE to support password changes.
Retry Attempts: Specifies how many times Cisco ISE requests user credentials before returning login failure. Valid values are 0 to 3.
Allow EAP-GTC: Check this check box to use EAP-GTC as the inner method.
Allow Password Change: Check this check box for Cisco ISE to support password changes.
Retry Attempts: Specifies how many times Cisco ISE requests user credentials before returning login failure. The valid range is from 0 to 3.
Allow EAP-TLS: Check this check box to use EAP-TLS as the inner method.
Check the Allow authentication of expired certificates to allow certificate renewal in Authorization Policy check box, if you want to allow users to renew certificates. If you check this check box, ensure that you configure appropriate authorization policy rules to check if the certificate has been renewed before processing the request any further.
Allow PEAPv0 Only for Legacy Clients: Check this check box to allow PEAP supplicants to negotiate using PEAPv0. Some legacy clients do not conform to the PEAPv1 protocol standards. To ensure that such PEAP conversations are not dropped, check this check box.
Allow EAP-FAST
Check this check box to enable EAP-FAST authentication protocol and EAP-FAST settings. The EAP-FAST protocol can support multiple internal protocols on the same server. The default inner method is MS-CHAPv2.
When you check the Allow EAP-FAST check box, you can configure EAP-FAST as the inner method:
Allow EAP-MS-CHAPv2
Allow Password Change: Check this check box for Cisco ISE to support password changes.
Retry Attempts: Specifies how many times Cisco ISE requests user credentials before returning login failure. Valid values are 0-3.
Allow EAP-GTC
Allow Password Change: Check this check box for Cisco ISE to support password changes.
Retry Attempts: Specifies how many times Cisco ISE requests user credentials before returning login failure. Valid values are 0-3.
Use PACs: Choose this option to configure Cisco ISE to provision authorization Protected Access Credentials (PAC) for EAP-FAST clients. Additional PAC options appear.
Don't Use PACs: Choose this option to configure Cisco ISE to use EAP-FAST without issuing or accepting any tunnel or machine PACs. All requests for PACs are ignored and Cisco ISE responds with a Success-TLV without a PAC.
When you choose this option, you can configure Cisco ISE to perform machine authentication.
Allow EAP-TLS: Check this check box to use EAP-TLS as the inner method.
Check the Allow authentication of expired certificates to allow certificate renewal in Authorization Policy check box, if you want to allow users to renew certificates. If you check this check box, ensure that you configure appropriate authorization policy rules to check if the certificate has been renewed before processing the request any further.
Enable EAP Chaining: Check this check box to enable EAP chaining.
EAP chaining allows Cisco ISE to correlate the results of user and machine authentication and apply the appropriate authorization policy using the EAPChainingResult attribute.
EAP chaining requires a supplicant that supports EAP chaining on the client device. Choose the User and Machine Authentication option in the supplicant.
EAP chaining is available when you choose the EAP-FAST protocol (both in PAC based and PAC less mode).
For PAC-based authentication, you can use user authorization PAC or machine authorization PAC, or both to skip the inner method.
For certificate-based authentication, if you enable the Accept Client Certificate for Provisioning option for the EAP-FAST protocol (in the Allowed Protocol service), and if the endpoint (AnyConnect) is configured to send the user certificate inside the tunnel, then during tunnel establishment, ISE authenticates the user using the certificate (the inner method is skipped), and machine authentication is done through the inner method. If these options are not configured, EAP-TLS is used as the inner method for user authentication.
After you enable EAP chaining, update your authorization policy and add a condition using the NetworkAccess:EapChainingResult attribute and assign appropriate permissions.
Allow EAP-TTLS
Check this check box to enable EAP-TTLS protocol.
You can configure the following inner methods:
Allow PAP/ASCII: Check this check box to use PAP/ASCII as the inner method. You can use EAP-TTLS PAP for token and OTP-based authentications.
Allow CHAP: Check this check box to use CHAP as the inner method. CHAP uses a challenge-response mechanism with password encryption. CHAP does not work with Microsoft Active Directory.
Allow MS-CHAPv1: Check this check box to use MS-CHAPv1 as the inner method.
Allow MS-CHAPv2: Check this check box to use MS-CHAPv2 as the inner method.
Allow EAP-MD5: Check this check box to use EAP-MD5 as the inner method.
Allow EAP-MS-CHAPv2: Check this check box to use EAP-MS-CHAPv2 as the inner method.
Allow Password Change: Check this check box for Cisco ISE to support password changes.
Retry Attempts: Specifies how many times Cisco ISE requests user credentials before returning login failure. Valid values are 0 to 3.
Preferred EAP Protocol
Check this check box to choose your preferred EAP protocols from any of the following options: EAP-FAST, PEAP, LEAP, EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, and EAP-MD5. If you do not specify the preferred protocol, EAP-TLS is used by default.

PAC Options
The following table describes the fields after you select Use PACs in the Allowed Protocols Services List window. The navigation path for this window is Policy > Policy Elements > Results > Authentication > Allowed Protocols.
Table 20. PAC Options
Field Name
Usage Guidelines
Use PAC
Tunnel PAC Time To Live: The Time to Live (TTL) value restricts the lifetime of the PAC. Specify the lifetime value and units. The default is 90 days. The range is between 1 and 1825 days.
Proactive PAC Update When: <n%> of PAC TTL is Left: The Update value ensures that the client has a valid PAC. Cisco ISE initiates an update after the first successful authentication but before the expiration time that is set by the TTL. The update value is a percentage of the remaining time in the TTL. The default is 90%.
Allow Anonymous In-band PAC Provisioning: Check this check box for Cisco ISE to establish a secure anonymous TLS handshake with the client and provision it with a PAC by using phase zero of EAP-FAST with EAP-MSCHAPv2. To enable anonymous PAC provisioning, you must choose both of the inner methods, EAP-MSCHAPv2 and EAP-GTC.
Allow Authenticated In-band PAC Provisioning: Cisco ISE uses SSL server-side authentication to provision the client with a PAC during phase zero of EAP-FAST. This option is more secure than anonymous provisioning but requires that a server certificate and a trusted root CA be installed on Cisco ISE.
When you check this option, you can configure Cisco ISE to return an Access-Accept message to the client after successful authenticated PAC provisioning.
Server Returns Access Accept After Authenticated Provisioning: Check this check box if you want Cisco ISE to return an access-accept package after authenticated PAC provisioning.
Allow Machine Authenticatio: Check this check box for Cisco ISE to provision an end-user client with a machine PAC and perform machine authentication (for end-user clients who do not have the machine credentials). The machine PAC can be provisioned to the client by request (in-band) or by the administrator (out-of-band). When Cisco ISE receives a valid machine PAC from the end-user client, the machine identity details are extracted from the PAC and verified in the Cisco ISE external identity source. Cisco ISE only supports Active Directory as an external identity source for machine authentication. After these details are correctly verified, no further authentication is performed.
When you check this option, you can enter a value for the amount of time that a machine PAC is acceptable for use. When Cisco ISE receives an expired machine PAC, it automatically reprovisions the end-user client with a new machine PAC (without waiting for a new machine PAC request from the end-user client).
Enable Stateless Session Resume: Check this check box for Cisco ISE to provision authorization PACs for EAP-FAST clients and skip phase two of EAP-FAST (default = enabled).
Uncheck this check box in the following cases:
If you do not want Cisco ISE to provision authorization PACs for EAP-FAST clients
To always perform phase two of EAP-FAST
When you check this option, you can enter the authorization period of the user authorization PAC. After this period, the PAC expires. When Cisco ISE receives an expired authorization PAC, it performs phase two EAP-FAST authentication.

Description: Enter a description for this authorization profile.
Access Type: Choose the access type: ACCESS_ACCEPT or ACCESS_REJECT.
Service Template: Enable this option to support sessions with SAnet-capable devices. Cisco ISE implements service templates in authorization profiles using a special flag that marks them as Service Template compatible. Since the service template is also an authorization profile, it acts as a single policy that supports both SAnet and non-SAnet devices.
Track Movement: Enable this option to track user location with Cisco Mobility Services Engine (MSE).

Note
This option may impact Cisco ISE performance, it is only intended for high-security locations.
Common Tasks
Common tasks are specific permissions and actions that apply to network access.
DACL Name: Enable this option to use a downloadable ACL. For example, Cisco ISE provides two default values in the drop-down list: PERMIT_ALL_TRAFFIC or DENY_ALL_TRAFFIC. The list includes all the current DACLs in the local database.
ACL (Filter-ID): Enable this option to configure a RADIUS filter-ID attribute. The filter-ID specifies an ACL on the NAD. When you define the filter-ID, Cisco ISE appends “.in” to the file name. Your Filter-ID is displayed in the Attributes Details pane.
Security Group: Enable this option to assign a security group (SGT) part of authorization.
If Cisco ISE is not integrated with Cisco DNA Center, Cisco ISE assigns VLAN ID 1.
If Cisco ISE is integrated with Cisco DNA Center, then select the Virtual Network (VN) that Cisco DNA Center shared with Cisco ISE, select the Data Type, and the subnet/address pool.

Note
A Security Group task includes a security group and a VN. If you configure a security group, then you cannot configure a VLAN. An endpoint device can only be assigned to one virtual network.
VLAN: Enable this option to specify a virtual LAN (VLAN) ID. You can enter integer or string values for the VLAN ID. The format for this entry is Tunnel-Private-Group-ID:VLANnumber.
Voice Domain Permission : Enable this option to use a downloadable ACL. The vendor-specific attribute (VSA) of cisco-av-pair is associated with the value device-traffic-class=voice. In multidomain authorization mode, if the network switch receives this VSA, the endpoint connects to a voice domain after authorization.
Web Redirection (CWA, DRW, MDM, NSP, CPP): Enable this option to enable web redirection after authentication.
Select the type of redirection. The type of Web Redirection that you select displays additional options, which are described below.
Enter an ACL to support the redirection that Cisco ISE sends to the NAD.
The ACL you enter to send to the NAD displays in the Attributes Details pane as a cisco-av pair. For example, if you enter acl119, it is displayed in the Attributes Details pane as: cisco-av-pair = url-redirect-acl = acl119.
Select the other settings for the selected web redirection type.
Select one of the following types web redirection:
Centralized Web Auth: Redirect to the portal you select from the Value drop-down.
Client Provisioning (Posture): Redirect to the client provisioning portal you select from the Value drop-down, to enable posture on the client.
Hot Spot: Redirect: Redirect to the hot spot portal you select from the Value drop-down.
MDM Redirect: Redirect to the MDM portal on the MDM server that you specify.
Native Supplicant Provisioning: Redirect to the BYOD portal you select from the Value drop-down.
After selecting the web redirection type, and entering the required parameters, configure the following options:
Display Certificates Renewal Message: Enable this option to display a certificate renewal message. The URL-redirect attribute value changes and includes the number of days for which the certificate is valid. This option is only for Centralized Web Auth redirection.
Static IP/Host Name/FQDN: Enable this option to redirect a user to a different PSN. Enter the target IP address, hostname, or FQDN. If you do not configure this option, the user is redirected to the FQDN of the policy service node that received this request.
Suppress Profiler CoA for endpoints in Logical Profile: Enable this option to cancel the redirect for a certain type of endpoint device.
Auto SmartPort: Enable this option to use Auto SmartPort functionality. Enter an event name, which creates a VSA cisco-av-pair with that value as auto-smart-port=event_name. This value is displayed in the Attributes Details pane.
Access Vulnerabilities: Enable this option to run the Threat Centric NAC Vulnerability Assessment on this endpoint as part of authorization. Select the adapter, and when to run the scan.
Reauthentication: Enable this option to keep the endpoint connected during reauthentication. You choose to maintain connectivity during reauthentication by choosing to use RADIUS-Request (1). The default RADIUS-Request (0) disconnects the existing session. You can also set an inactivity timer.
MACSec Policy: Enable this option to use the MACSec encryption policy whenever a MACSec enabled client connects to Cisco ISE. Choose one of the following options: must-secure, should-secure, or must-not-secure. Your settings are displayed in the Attributes Details pane as: cisco-av-pair = linksec-policy=must-secure.
NEAT : Enable this option to use Network Edge Access Topology (NEAT), which extends identity recognition between networks. Checking this check box displays cisco-av-pair = device-traffic-class=switch in the Attributes Details pane.
Web Authentication (Local Web Auth) : Enable this option to use local web authentication for this authorization profile. This value lets the switch recognize authorization for web authentication by Cisco ISE sending a VSA along with a DACL. The VSA is cisco-av-pair = priv-lvl=15, which is displayed in the Attributes Details pane.
Airespace ACL Name: Enable this option to send an ACL name to Cisco Airespace wireless controller. The Airespace VSA uses this ACL to authorize a locally defined ACL to a connection on the WLC. For example, if you entered rsa-1188, it is displayed as Airespace-ACL-Name = rsa-1188 in the Attributes Details pane.
ASA VPN: Enable this option to assign an Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA) VPN group policy. From the drop-down list, choose a VPN group policy.
AVC Profile Name: Enable this option to run application visibility on this endpoint. Enter the AVC profile to use.
