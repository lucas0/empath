Note
Finesse agent desktop controls should be preferred over the agent phone device for call control operations for a more robust and efficient experience for the agent.
The Finesse agent desktop provides the following out of the box functionality:
Basic call control: Answer, hold, retrieve, end, and make calls.
Toaster Notifications: Notification that informs of any voice calls when the Finesse desktop window or tab is inactive.
Desktop notifications:
For incoming voice calls: Popover with configured customer details appear with the Answer button.
For campaign initiated outbound calls: Popover with configured customer details appear with the Accept or Decline buttons.
Advanced call control: Make a consult call and transfer or conference the call after the consultation.
Agent state and call timers: The agent state timer indicates the duration in Ready or Not Ready state. The call timer indicates total call time, hold time, and wrap-up time.
Single-step transfer: Transfer a call without first initiating a consultation call.
Preview Outbound calls: Preview the customer information for the call before you choose to accept, reject, or close the contact.
Schedule a callback: Schedule a callback for an Outbound Dialer call to call a customer back at a more convenient time.
Preview Outbound Personal Callback calls: After you preview a personal callback call, you can choose to accept or reject the contact.
Send DTMF digits: Send DTMF digits to interact with an IVR system.
Not Ready and Sign Out reasons: Reasons to indicate why you’re changing your status to Not Ready or Sign Out (your administrator defines these reasons).
Wrap-Up Reasons: Wrap-Up Reason for each call (your administrator defines the Wrap-Up Reasons).
Phonebooks: List of contacts from which you can select one to call. Your administrator defines the contacts that are listed in your phonebook.
Any contact name exceeding the preset width (170 pixels) have an ellipsis and a tool tip next to it to show the full name.
Workflows: Your administrator can define workflows that are triggered by call and digital channels events (for example, your administrator may create a workflow that causes a browser pop on your desktop when a call arrives).
Language Support: If your administrator installed Finesse language packs, when you sign in to Finesse, you can choose from a list of supported languages for the desktop.
System Reason Codes: Due to system-generated events, your state may change to either Not Ready or Sign Out with system-generated reason codes. In this case, the agent state is displayed in yellow.
Desktop Chat: You can chat with other agents, supervisor, or with other Subject Matter Experts in the organization.
Making a Call: You can make a call from the dialpad, by either entering the number or using the one-click option in the phone book.
Team Message: Teams can view the messages sent by their respective supervisors and take necessary action.
Agent Device Selection: Agents can select the telephony device when logging into Cisco Finesse desktop.
Desktop Customization: Agents can customize their desktop area as per their requirement by resizing and reorganizing the gadgets. The gadgets are automatically reorganized when the page is resized. The Call Control gadget is automatically minimized or maximized when any of the gadgets are maximized or minimized respectively.
The functionality available to you depends on what your administrator has configured. For example, if your administrator didn’t define Wrap-Up Reasons, you can’t choose a wrap-up reason.

Note
Webex CCE uses ASCII encoding (8-bits), while Finesse uses UTF-8 encoding (32-bits), so the First Name field in the Call Control area is truncated to only 16 characters.
Finesse Queue Statistics Gadget
The Finesse agent desktop also provides a Queue Statistics gadget. The Queue Statistics gadget displays information about the queues to which you’re assigned. You can click the column headers to sort information in ascending or descending order. The Queue Statistics gadget provides information about the following:
Queue Name: Name of the queue.
# Calls: Number of calls waiting in the queue.
Max Time: Duration of the oldest call has been in the queue.
Ready: Number of agents assigned to the queue who are in Ready state.
Not Ready: Number of agents assigned to the queue who are in Not Ready state.
Active
In: Number of agents assigned to the queue who are on inbound calls.
Out: Number of agents assigned to the queue who are on outbound calls.
Other: Number of agents assigned to the queue who are on internal consult calls.
Wrap-Up
Ready (Pending): Number of agents assigned to the queue who transitions to Ready state when Wrap-Up ends.
Not Ready (Pending): Number of agents assigned to the queue who transitions to Not Ready state when Wrap-Up ends.
For additional information about how the Queue Statistics gadget collects and displays statistics, see the gadget description provided in Finesse Supervisor Desktop.
Finesse Supervisor Desktop
The following figure shows the Cisco Finesse supervisor desktop.
Figure 2. Finesse Supervisor Desktop
Finesse Supervisor Desktop provides call control functionality and the following:
Team Performance gadget
Queue Statistics gadget
Team Message

Note
To ensure all features of the Finesse supervisor desktop work properly, you must disable pop-up blockers.
Team Performance Gadget
On the Team Performance gadget, you can select a team from a list of teams assigned to you. You can view the agents on that team, their current state, the time in state, their recent call history, and state history and their extension. Click the column headers to sort the information by Agent Name, State, Time in State, or Extension.
The Time in State field refreshes every 10 seconds. When an agent's state changes, the Finesse server sends out an agent state notification and the timer resets to 0. An agent state change includes changing from Not Ready with a reason code to Not Ready with a new reason code.

Note
For the logged out agent, the Time in State field shows the total duration since the agent has logged out. For the time in the logged out state to be displayed, the agent must have logged in or changed the state at least once via Finesse desktop or through other applications post Finesse server restart. If not, this field displays a blank value.
Team Performance gadget also provides the following functionality:
Silent monitoring: Silently monitor an agent's call.
Force state change: Force an agent into Ready or Not Ready state or sign out an agent.
When you silently monitor an agent, the Barge In button appears in the call control area. Click this button to barge in to a call between the agent and customer. After you barge in, you can choose to intercept the call by dropping the agent.
Team Message
Supervisors can broadcast messages to their teams. Teams can view the messages sent by their respective supervisors and take necessary action. This is a one-way communication from supervisors to their teams.
State and Call Timers
The agent state timer appears next to the agent state drop-down when you are in Not Ready or Ready state. This timer updates every second and the format is mm:ss. If you are in any state for more than one hour, the format changes to hh:mm:ss (for example, 05:25 or 01:10:25).
When you change state (for example, from Not Ready to Ready or change the reason code of Not Ready), the timer resets to 00:00.
The Finesse desktop provides call timers in the Call Control gadget (in the format mm:ss). The call timers provide the following information:
Total Call Time: Indicates the duration of your current call.
Hold Time: Indicates the total call on hold time. When you place a call on hold, this timer shows the hold time, followed by the total call time in parentheses.
Wrap-Up Time: Indicates the duration that you have been in wrap-up state. If wrap-up is enabled, you transition to wrap-up state when you end the call. Depending on the configuration done by the administrator, the timer can either countdown or count up the time.
If the call exceeds one hour, the timer still displays in minutes and seconds. For example, at one hour and 15 seconds, the timer displays 1:00:15.

Note
If the Finesse server cannot accurately calculate the state time or the call time (such as under certain failover conditions), the timer displays in the format "- -:- -"
Finesse Desktop Behavior
If the Cisco Finesse desktop isn't the active window and you receive an incoming call on the desktop, the Finesse desktop either becomes the active window or flashes in the taskbar. The Cisco Finesse desktop behavior varies based on the browser and the number of tabs opened.
If you refresh the browser when a gadget is maximized, the gadget returns to its previous size.
Toaster Notification
When there's an incoming call and the Cisco Finesse desktop window or tab is inactive, Finesse displays a notification with the call details. Click the notification to restore the Finesse desktop.
The Operating System controls the position of the notification and may display it at any one of the four corners of your computer screen.

Note
Internet Explorer doesn’t support toaster notification.
Browser Settings for Chrome
The toaster notifications may not pop up in the Chrome browser for Windows 10, but are displayed in the Notification Action Center. To display the notifications on your desktop, and not in the Notification Action Center, disable the Enable Native Notifications feature in the Chrome browser (version 86 and earlier). Notifications displayed on your desktop, are in the native format.
Open Chrome and enter chrome://flags/#enable-native-notifications.
Press the Enter key on your keyboard.
Select the Disabled option from the labeled box drop-down list.
Click Relaunch Now.
The notifications are displayed on your desktop in the native format.
Multi-Tab Gadgets
Multi-Tab Gadgets
Finesse desktop supports accessing multiple gadgets through tabs within a single gadget called Multi-Tab gadget. The Multi-Tab gadget allows rendering gadgets in a single desktop view, thus presenting more information to agents and supervisors in a concise and readily accessible manner. Agents and supervisors do not have to scroll down the page or switch between desktop container tabs to see additional information.
The Multi-Tab gadget can host any gadget supported by the desktop, except the Advanced Capabilities and Manage Chat and Email gadgets. Multiple instances of Multi-Tab gadgets are supported, which allows agents and supervisors to stack groups of gadgets to customize their desktop.
The main features of Multi-Tab gadget are as follows:
Page-level gadgets and other types of gadgets can be hosted side by side as tabs within the Multi-Tab gadget.
Gadget tabs can be dragged and dropped to different locations in the Multi-Tab gadget header.
Shortcut keys can be used to switch between gadgets within the Multi-Tab gadget.
Individual gadgets within a Multi-Tab gadget can have different heights that are defined by the Cisco Finesse administrator in the Desktop Layout. However, it is possible for an agent to enable a common height for all gadgets by using the Dynamic Height toggle button.
The Call Control gadget can be hosted as a tab within the Multi-Tab gadget.
Gadgets can be made to appear or hide based on the desktop context, using APIs. For more information, see the Multi-Tab Gadgets section in the Cisco Finesse Web Services Developer and JavaScript Guide at https://developer.cisco.com/docs/finesse/.
Notifications can be made to appear or hide to control user attention, using APIs. For more information, see the Multi-Tab Gadgets section in the Cisco Finesse Web Services Developer and JavaScript Guide at https://developer.cisco.com/docs/finesse/.
By default, seven gadget tabs can appear in the Multi-Tab gadget header. Additional tabs are moved into the tab selector drop-down list.
The following figure shows the default configurations of the Finesse desktop containing the Multi-Tab gadget.
Figure 3. Multi-Tab Gadgets
Ordering of Multi-Tab Gadget Tabs
The Multi-Tab gadget feature allows agents and supervisors to view multiple gadgets in a single view. The sequence of the tabs is based on the desktop layout configured by the administrator. When agents and supervisors log in for the first time, the gadget configured as the default in the desktop layout appears as the left-most gadget and has the default focus. Gadgets can be reordered by dragging them. For a particular agent or supervisor, this order is retained across logouts when the same browser is used (browser cache should not be cleared). Any change in the desktop layout by the administrator, the tab order is reset to the default layout during the next session or when the page is reloaded.
Multi-Tab Behavior When Switching Between Desktop Container Tabs
When you switch the desktop container tab using the navigation bar, only the page-level gadgets are retained in the Multi-Tab gadget. The other gadgets are replaced with a new set of gadgets that are configured for the new desktop container tab.
For example, when agents and supervisors navigate from the Home desktop container tab to the History desktop container tab, the page-level gadgets remain the same. However, the desktop container specific gadget Queue Statistics is replaced by the Recent Call History gadget.
Figure 4. History
Reset Tab Order
The Reset Tab Order button changes the sequence of the gadget tabs to the default order that was configured by the Cisco Finesse administrator.
Dynamic Height
The Dynamic Height toggle button determines if individual gadgets within a Multi-Tab gadget have different heights (as configured by the Cisco Finesse administrator) or retain a common height.
If the Dynamic Height toggle button is set to On, individual gadgets within a Multi-Tab Gadget acquire the respective height configured by the Cisco Finesse administrator.
If the Dynamic Height toggle button is set to Off, all individual gadgets within a Multi-Tab Gadget retain a common height. A scroll bar might appear for the gadgets whose content is larger than the configured common height.
Drag and Drop
The Multi-Tab gadget feature enables agents and supervisors to drag and drop the gadget tabs relative to one another within the Multi-Tab gadget header. Select a gadget by clicking on a gadget tab. Drag the gadget and drop it at the desired location on the Multi-Tab gadget header. The order of gadgets moved by agents and supervisors is retained across fail overs and browser reboots. This can be cleared by using the Reset Tab Order button. This order is lost when agents and supervisors switches to a different browser or when the browser cache is cleared.
Drop Down
When there are more gadgets in the header than specified by the maxTabsOnTabbedGadgetHeader desktop property, a drop-down icon appears next to the last visible gadget name (more information, see the Cisco Finesse CLI chapter in the Cisco Finesse Administration Guide at https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/customer-collaboration/finesse/products-maintenance-guides-list.html). Upon clicking on the icon, the remaining gadget tabs are displayed in the drop-down list and can be used to activate any of the required tabs. The drop-down icon displays a notification indicator when any of the gadget tabs that are part of the drop-down displays a notification.
Maximize and Collapse
The Multi-Tab gadget functionality supports the maximize and collapse options when configured as a page-level gadget or a desktop container tab level gadget in the default layout setting. Once the Multi-Tab gadget is maximized, it stays maximized even when alternate tabs are activated. Agents and supervisors can restore the view by selecting the restore button from the Multi-Tab menu. Upon selecting the collapse menu item it collapses Multi-Tab gadget content area and retains only the header containing the tabs.
Multi-Tab Gadget Notifications
A notification is shown in the gadgets to alert agents and supervisors about new activity in the gadget. A small red dot is displayed on the top-right corner of the gadget name to notify agents and supervisors about content changes within the gadget. When the gadget is under the drop-down list, the notification icon appears in the drop-down symbol.
The following figure demonstrates the notification functionality in Multi-Tab gadgets.
Figure 5. Notification

Note
Notification functionality is unavailable for screen readers.
Call Control Gadget in Multi-Tab
Finesse desktop Call Control gadget can be hosted as a tab within the Multi-Tab gadget. This frees up space within the desktop area. Once included, the Call Control gadget automatically hides or shows up depending on if the call is present on the desktop. It also shows notifications for changes in the call context.
The following figure demonstrates the desktop Call Control gadget placed within a Multi-Tab gadget.
Figure 6. Call Control Gadget in Multi-Tab
Call Control Notifications in Multi-Tab Gadgets
When the Call Control gadget is configured as one of the Multi-Tab gadgets, notification appears during the following scenarios:
When an agent answers an incoming call, accepts an outbound call, or dials a number.
If an agent is in some other tab when the call ends and the agent moves to Wrap-Up state.
When an agent applies any shortcut key, except in the following condition: The agent is in a different tab, there is only a single call that the agent is handling, and the End Call shortcut key is pressed. In this scenario, Call Control is not activated.
Third-Party Gadget Notifications in Multi-Tab Gadgets
Third-party gadgets can be included in a Multi-Tab gadget on the Finesse desktop.
The Cisco Finesse administrator cannot configure notification settings for third-party gadgets. Only the developer of the third-party gadget can configure notification settings for the gadget.
Accessibility
Multi-Tab gadget tabs can be switched using keyboard shortcuts. For more information see Agent Keyboard Shortcuts.
Finesse Desktop Failover
In a contact center deployment, Cisco Finesse is installed on two nodes. If the Finesse server that you are currently signed in goes out of service, a banner appears at the top of the desktop notifying that the desktop has lost connection to the server.
The Finesse desktop checks if the current Finesse server state is recovered and if the alternate Finesse server is available.
If the current Finesse server recovers, the desktop is reconnected. If it does not recover and the alternate server is available, your desktop redirects to the alternate server and automatically signs you in.
If the desktop fails over or reconnects and the last state you selected prior to the failover was Ready, Finesse attempts to preserve that state. When Finesse recovers, the desktop attempts to send a request to put you back in Ready state.

Note
When the desktop tries to connect to the alternate server, you may see the following pop-up message:
Following certificates should be accepted before using Cisco Finesse Desktop.....
If you are unable to accept the security certificates, and keep seeing the message to accept the certificates, close the pop-up and continue to sign in.

Note
The Cisco Finesse desktop can only preserve Ready states that were selected on the same desktop. The following exceptions apply:
If you are in Wrap-Up state when the desktop recovers, Cisco Finesse does not send a request because that would automatically end your wrap-up session. After the wrap-up timer expires, your state is determined by Unified Communications Manager and may depend on the type of failover that occurred.
If your state was changed to Not Ready (either by your supervisor or by the system (for example, Ring No Answer), your selection of Ready is not preserved.
Unsolicited state changes are not taken into account. For example, if a supervisor changes your state to Ready (you did not select Ready), your Ready state may not be preserved. If your last selection was Ready and the system attempts to change your state to Ready (such as for Ring No Answer), your selection of Ready is preserved.
Finesse Maintenance Mode
Cisco Finesse agents must accept both the certificates on the Cisco Finesse nodes when logging into the Finesse desktop in order to receive the notifications for the Finesse maintenance mode. When the maintenance mode starts, agents get notifications with a banner message saying the exact time the desktop starts migrating to the alternate node. A countdown timer is displayed exactly 15 seconds before the actual migration. When the countdown timer reaches zero, agents are automatically migrated to the alternate node.

Note
Agent to agent chat history is not maintained after migrating to the alternate node.
One Finesse Desktop or Finesse IPPA Session Per Agent
Finesse has the following agent session behavior:
Finesse does not support agents simultaneously sign in to Finesse desktop and Finesse IPPA. Agents must sign in to Finesse desktop or Finesse IPPA.
Finesse can support a mix of agents where some agents use Finesse IPPA and other agents use Finesse desktop (license permitting).
When agents are signed in to the Finesse desktop or Finesse IPPA, they can also simultaneously sign in to a third-party application using the Finesse API. (This setup is considered a custom development. Similar to other Finesse customizations, the customer or partner is responsible for proper development and testing of this custom setup.)
Multiline Support
If multiline is configured, you can have one or more secondary lines on your phone. Finesse does not publish or display any information about the secondary lines on the Finesse desktop.
Accessibility
The Finesse desktop supports features that improve accessibility for low-vision and vision-impaired users. The following table shows how to navigate the Finesse desktop using the accessibility features.

Note
If you are using Mac keyboard, then press Option instead of Alt. For example, for Language Selector Drop-Down press Option–Down Arrow.
