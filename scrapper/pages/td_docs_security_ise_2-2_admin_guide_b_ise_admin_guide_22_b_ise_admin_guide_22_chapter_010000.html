End-User Portals
Cisco ISE provides web-based portals for three primary sets of end users:
Guests who need to temporarily access your enterprise network using the Guest portals (Hotspot and credentialed Guest portals).
Employees who are designated as sponsors who can create and manage guest accounts using the Sponsor portal.
Employees who are using their personal devices on the enterprise network using the various non-guest portals such as the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), Mobile Device Management (MDM), and My Devices portals.
Customization of End-User Web Portals
You can edit, duplicate, and create more portals. You can also fully customize the portal appearance and, therefore, the portal experience. You can customize each individual portal without affecting other portals.
You can customize various aspects of the portal interface that apply to the entire portal or to specific pages of the portal, such as:
Themes, images, colors, banners, and footers
Languages used for displaying portal text, error messages, and notifications
Titles, content, instructions, and field and button labels
Notifications sent to guests via email, SMS, and printer (applies only to the Self-Registered Guest and Sponsor portals)
Error and informational messages displayed to users
For the the Self-Registered Guest and Sponsor portals, you can create custom fields to gather guest information specific to your needs

For more information about customizing web portals, see ISE Portal Builder and HowTo: ISE Web Portal Customization Options.
Customization Methods
There are several different ways to customize the end user portals pages, which require different levels of knowledge.
Basic: You can modify the portal Customization page:
Upload banners and logos
Change some colors (except for buttons)
Change the text on the screens, and the language used on the entire portal
Intermediate
Use the minieditor to add HTML and Javascript

Note
Before you can enter HTML in a minieditor, click the HTML icon.
Use the jQuery mobile theme roller to change the color of all page elements
Advanced
Manually modify properties and CSS files.
After you customize your portal, you can create multiple portals (of the same type) by duplicating it. For example, if you customized your Hotspot Guest portal for one business entity, you can duplicate it and make minor changes to create custom Hotspot Guest portals for other business entities.
Tips for Customizing Portals with the Mini Editors
Long words in a minieditor box may scroll off the screen area of the portal. You can break the line with the HTML paragraph attribute style="word-wrap: break-word". For example:
 <p style="word-wrap:break-word">
 thisisaverylonglineoftextthatwillexceedthewidthoftheplacethatyouwanttoputitsousethisstructure
 </p>
When you use HTML or javascript to customize portal pages, make sure that you use valid syntax. Cisco ISE doesn’t validate the tags and code that you enter into a minieditor. Invalid syntax may cause problems during the portal flow.
Portal Content Types
Cisco ISE provides a default set of portal themes that you can use “as is” or customize by using the existing CSS files as models to create new custom files. However, you can alter the appearance of the portals without using customized CSS files.
For instance, if you want to use unique corporate logos and banner images, you can simply upload and use these new image files. You can customize the default color scheme by changing the color of the different elements and areas of the portals. You can even choose the language in which you want to view the custom changes as you make them.
When you design images to replace the logos and banner, make the images as close to the following pixel size as you can:
Banner 1724 X 133
Desktop Logo 86 X 45
Mobile Logo 80 X 35
Note that ISE resizes the images to fit the portal, but images that are too small may not look right after resizing.
To perform advanced customization, such as changing the page layout or adding video clips or advertisements to your portal pages, you can use your own custom CSS files.
These types of changes within a specific portal are applied globally to all the pages of that portal. Changes to the page layout can be applied either globally or to just one specific page in the portal.
Portal Page Titles, Content, and Labels
You can customize the titles, text boxes, instructions, field and button labels, and other visual elements that the guest views on the end-user web portal pages. While you are customizing the page, you can even edit the page settings dynamically.
These changes are applied only to the specific page that you are customizing.
Basic Customization of Portals
Select a predefined theme that best suits your needs, and use most of its default settings. You can then do some basic customization, such as:
Modify the Portal Theme Colors
Change the Portal Icons, Images, and Logos
Update the Portal Banner and Footer Elements
Change the Portal Display Language
Change the Titles, Instructions, Buttons, and Label Text
Format and Style Text Box Content

Tip
You can View Your Customization as you make the updates.

Custom Portal Files
Modify the Portal Theme Colors
You can customize the default color scheme in the default portal themes and change the color of the different elements and areas of the portals. These changes apply to the entire portal that you are customizing.
If you plan to change the portal colors, be aware of the following:
You cannot use this option to change the color scheme in any of the custom portal themes that you may have imported for use with this portal. You must edit the custom theme CSS file to change its color settings.
After changing the colors in a portal theme, if you select another portal theme from the Portal Theme drop-down menu, the changes are lost in the original portal theme and it reverts to its default colors.
If you tweak the colors of a portal theme with an already modified color scheme and then reset its colors before saving it, the color scheme reverts to its default colors and any previous modifications are lost.

Note 
The test portal does not support RADIUS sessions, so you won't see the entire portal flow for all portals. BYOD and Client Provisioning are examples of portals that depend on RADIUS sessions. If you have more than one PSN, Cisco ISE chooses the first active PSN.
Custom Portal Files
The custom portal files menu lets you upload your own files to the ISE server, which you can use to customize all user facing portals (except for the Admin portal). The files you upload are stored on the PSN and synchronized to all PSNs.
Supported file types are:
.png, .gif, .jpg, .jpeg, ico: For backgrounds, announcements, and advertisements
.htm, .html, .js, .json, .css, .m4a, .m4v, .mp3, .mp4, .mpeg, .ogg, .wav: For advanced customization (for example,portal builder)
File sizes are limited to:
20 MB per file
200 MB total of all files
The path column in the list of files displays the URL to the file on this server, which you can use to reference it outside the mini-editor. If the file is an image, when you click the link, it opens a new window that displays the image.
Uploaded files can be referenced by all portal types, except the Admin portal, in the mini-editors under Portal Page Customization. To insert the file into a mini-editor, click Insert File. Toggle to the HTML Source view, and you will see the inserted file surrounded by the appropriate HTML tags.
You can also view the displayable uploaded files in your browser from outside of ISE, for testing. The URL is https://ise_ip:8443/portal/customFiles/filename.
Advanced Customization of Portals
If you do not want to use one of the default portal themes provided by Cisco ISE, you can customize the portal to suit your needs. To do so, you must have experience working with CSS and Javascript files and the jQuery Mobile ThemeRoller application.
You cannot alter the default portal themes, but you can:
Export a Portal’s Default Theme CSS File and use it as a base for creating a custom portal theme.
Create a Custom Portal Theme CSS File by editing the default portal theme and saving it as a new file.
Import the Custom Portal Theme CSS File and apply it to the portal.
Depending on your expertise and requirements, you can perform various types of advanced customization. You can use predefined variables to enable consistency in displayed information, add advertisements to your portal pages, use HTML, CSS and Javascript code to customize your content, and modify the portal page layout.
You modify the portal by adding HMTL, CSS, and javascript into the content boxes on the Portal Page Customization tab of each portal. This document has examples of customization with HTML and CSS. Examples using javascript are on the ISE community here: http://cs.co/ise-community. More HTML, CSS, and Javascript examples are on the ISE community here: https://community.cisco.com/t5/security-documents/how-to-ise-web-portal-customization-options/ta-p/3619042.

Note
TAC does not support Javascript customizations of Cisco ISE portals. If you are having problems with Javascript customizations, please post your questions to the ISE community https://community.cisco.com/t5/identity-services-engine-ise/bd-p/5301j-disc-ise.

Enable Advanced Portal Customization
Cisco ISE allows you to customize the content that displays on your end-user portals. You can enter HTML, CSS, and Javascript code in the text boxes on the different pages listed under Portal Page Customization.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Administration > System > Admin Access > Settings > Portal Customization.
Step 2
Verify that Enable portal customization with HTML is checked by default. This setting enables you to include HTML tags in the Instructional Text, Optional Content 1 and Optional Content 2 fields.
Step 3
Check Enable portal customization with HTML and Javascript if you want to do advanced JavaScript customization by including <script> tags in the Instructional Text, Optional Content 1 and Optional Content 2 fields.
Portal Theme and Structure CSS Files
If you have experience with working with CSS files, you can customize the default portal theme CSS files to alter the portal presentation and manipulate elements such as the page layout, colors, and fonts. Customizing the CSS files provides you with flexibility and control in specifying the presentation characteristics, it enables you to share formatting across multiple pages, and it reduces the complexity and repetition in the structural content.
Cisco ISE end-user portals use two distinct types of CSS files: structure.css and theme.css. Every portal theme has its own theme.css file, but there is only one structure.css file per portal type; for example guest.structure.css for Guest portals, sponsor.structure.css for Sponsor Portals, and mydevices.structure.css for My Devices portals.
The structure.css provides the styling for the page layout and structure. It defines the positioning of elements on each page and also includes jQuery Mobile structure styles. You can only view the structure.css file, but you cannot edit it. However, when you change the page layout within theme.css files, import these files into the portal, and apply them, the most recent changes take priority over the structure.css styles.
The theme.css files specify styles such as fonts, button colors, and header background. You can export the theme.css files, change the theme settings, and import them to use as custom themes for your portal. Any page layout style changes made to the theme.css files take priority over the styles that are defined in the structure.css file.
You cannot alter any of the Cisco provided default portal theme.css files. However, you can edit the settings in the files and save them to a new custom theme.csstheme.css file. You can make further edits to the custom theme.css file, but when you import it back into Cisco ISE, remember to use the same theme name you originally used for it. You cannot use two different theme names for the same theme.css file.
For example, you can use a default green theme.css file to create a new custom blue theme.css file and name it as Blue. You can then edit the blue theme.css file, but when you import it again, you must reuse the same Blue theme name. You cannot call it Red, since Cisco ISE checks for the relationship between a filename and its name and the uniqueness of the theme’s name. You can however edit the blue theme.css file, save it as red theme.css, import the new file, and name it as Red.
About Changing Theme Colors with jQuery Mobile
The color scheme of Cisco's end-user portals is compatible with jQuery ThemeRoller. You can easily edit the colors for an entire portal using the ThemeRoller web site.
ThemeRoller color “swatches” contain a unique color scheme, which defines the colors, textures, and font settings for the primary UI elements, such as toolbars, content blocks, buttons, list items, and font text-shadow. A color scheme also defines the settings for various interaction states of the buttons: normal, hover, and pressed.
Cisco uses three swatches:
Swatch A—The default swatch.
Swatch B—Defines emphasized elements, such as an Accept button.
Swatch C—Defines critical elements such as alerts, error messages, invalid input fields, and delete buttons.
You cannot apply additional swatches, unless you add HTML code (to the Optional Content, for example) with elements that use the newly added swatches.
To edit the default Cisco-provided CSS files or create new files based on the CSS classes and structures defined in the default themes, use the required version of jQuery Mobile ThemeRoller (Release 1.3.2).
For additional information on swatches and themes in jQuery Mobile ThemeRoller, see "Theming Overview" in Creating a Custom Theme with ThemeRoller. Use the online help in jQuery Mobile ThemeRoller to learn how to download, import, and share your custom themes.
For tutorials on how to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript code to customize the text and content that appears on your portal pages, visit Codecademy.
Example of a Theme That Shows Cisco Swatches
To demonstrate how swatches are used, the default theme for the Guest Portal was edited in ThemeRoller to show the differences in color.
The following screen shows a guest portal logon error (swatch C) along with a button that takes an action from the user (swatch B), and the rest of the screen is Swatch A.
Change Theme Colors with jQuery Mobile
Change Theme Colors with jQuery Mobile
Before you begin
Make sure you are using version 1.3.2 of jQuery Mobile ThemeRoller. The version you are using is displayed in the top-left corner of the screen, as shown below.
Procedure
Step 1
Export an existing theme from the portal you wish to change by clicking the Configuration tab on the portal.
Step 2
Choose Advanced Customization > Export/Import Themes.
Step 3
In the Custom Theming dialog, export the theme you want to update.
Step 4
Open that theme in a text editor, select all, and copy.
Step 5
Paste that text (CSS) into the jQuery web site's Import Theme field.
Step 6
Make your changes in the jQuery Mobil web-based application.
Step 7
Export the updated theme from the jQuery website (the export format is ZIP).
Step 8
Unzip the updated theme, and extract the updated theme in themes folder to your PC. The name of the theme is the one you provided on the jQuery website.
Step 9
Import the extracted CSS theme file into your portal in the portal configuration page's Custom Theming dialog.
You can switch back and forth between the old theme and the new theme by clicking the Portal Theme drop-down list on the Portal Configuration window.
Location Based Customization
When guest accounts are created, you can associate them with a location and specify a Service Set Identifier (SSID) attribute. Both the location and SSID are available as CSS classes that you can use to apply different CSS styles to portal pages, based on the guest's location and SSID.
For example:
Guest location—When guests with accounts that have San Jose or Boston as their locations log into a credentialed Guest portal, one of these classes is available on every portal page: guest-location-san-jose or guest-location-boston.
Guest SSID—For an SSID named Coffee Shop Wireless, the following CSS class is available on every portal page: guest-ssid-coffee-shop-wireless. This SSID is the one you specified on the guest account and not the SSID that the guests connected to when they logged in.

Note
This information applies only to the credentialed Guest portals after the guests log in.
You can also specify locations when you add devices such as switches and Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs) to a network. This location is also available as a CSS class that you can use to apply different CSS styles to portal pages depending on the network device's location.
For example, if a WLC is assigned to Seattle and guests are redirected to Cisco ISE from the Seattle-WLC, the following CSS class is available on every portal page: device-location-my-locations-usa-seattle.

User Device Type Based Customization
Cisco ISE detects the type of client device (guest, sponsor, or employee) to access your company’s network or end-user web portals (Guest, Sponsor, and Device). It is detected either as a mobile device (Android, iOS, and so on) or a desktop device (Windows, MacOS, and so on). The device type is available as a CSS class that you can use to apply different CSS styles to portal pages based on the user’s device type.
When a user logs in to any of the Cisco ISE end-user web portals, the following class is available on their portal pages: cisco-ise-mobile or cisco-ise-desktop.

<div class="custom-greeting custom-san-jose-greeting">
    Welcome to The Golden State!
</div>
<div class="custom-greeting custom-boston-greeting">
    Welcome to The Bay State!
</div>
Guests will see a different message after successful logon, depending on their specific location.
Customize Greetings Based on User Device Type
You can customize the greetings that you send to your users (guest, sponsor, or employee) after they log into any of the Cisco ISE end-user web portals (Guest, Sponsor and Device), based on their client device type (mobile or desktop).
Use the Toggle Full Screen option to increase and decrease the size of the fields as you work in them.
Procedure
Step 1
Navigate to these portals:
For Guest portals, choose Work Centers > Guest Access > Portals & Components > Guest Portals > Edit > Portal Page Customization.
For Sponsor portals, choose Work Centers > Guest Access > Portals & Components > Sponsor Portals > Edit > Portal Page Customization.
For Device portals, choose Administration > Device Portal Management > (any Portals) > Edit > Portal Page Customization.
Step 2

</div>
<div class="custom-greeting custom-desktop-greeting">
    We brough back our Triple Chocolate Muffin!
    Grab a seat and dig in!
</div>
Users will see a different greeting on the AUP page depending on the type of device they used to gain access to the network or portal.
Modify the Portal Page Layout
You can manipulate the overall layout of the pages; for example, you can add a sidebar to an AUP page that provides additional information or links to information.
Procedure
Step 1
Add the following CSS code to the bottom of the custom theme.css file that you create and plan to apply to your portal. This changes the AUP page layout. The Optional Content 1 field appears as a side bar in the desktop and mobile device mode.
#page-aup .cisco-ise-optional-content-1 {
        margin-bottom: 5px;
}
@media all and ( min-width: 60em ) {
        #page-aup .cisco-ise-optional-content-1 {
                float: left;
                margin-right: 5px;
                width: 150px;
        }
        #page-aup .cisco-ise-main-content {
                float: left;
                width: 800px;
        }
        #page-aup .cisco-ise-main-content h1,
        #page-aup .cisco-ise-main-content p {
                margin-right: auto;
                margin-left: -200px;
        }
}
You can then add links using HTML code in the Optional Content 1 field for the AUP window for that portal.
Step 2
Navigate to these portals:
For Guest portals, choose Work Centers > Guest Access > Portal & Components > Guest Portals > Edit > Portal Page Customization.
For Sponsor portals, choose Work Centers > Guest Access > Portal & Components > Sponsor Portals > Edit > Portal Page Customization.

Step 3
Under Pages, choose the page for which you want to include a side bar.
Step 4
Under Page Customizations, use the mini-editor provided with the Optional Content 1 field to enter and view source code.
Step 5
Click Toggle HTML Source.
Step 6
Enter your source code.
For example, to include a side bar for the AUP window, enter this code in the Optional Content 1 field on the AUP window:
<ul data-role="listview">
    <li>Rent a Car</li>
    <li>Top 10 Hotels</li>
    <li>Free Massage</li>
    <li>Zumba Classes</li>
</ul>

You can upload any custom theme.css file that you have created and apply it to any of your end-user portals. These changes apply to the entire portal that you are customizing.
Any time you edit a custom theme.css file and import it back into Cisco ISE, remember to use the same theme name you originally used for it. You cannot use two different theme names for the same theme.css file.
Procedure
Step 1
Navigate to these portals:
For Guest portals, choose Work Centers > Guest Access > Portals & Components > Configure > Guest Portals > Edit > Portal Page Customization.
For Sponsor portals, choose Work Centers > Guest Access > Portals & Components > Sponsor Portals > Edit > Portal Page Customization.

Before you begin
The portal theme that you want to delete should not be used by any of the portals.
Procedure
Step 1
Navigate to these portals:
For Guest portals, choose Work Centers > Guest Access > Portals & Components > Guest Portals > Edit > Portal Page Customization.
For Sponsor portals, choose Work Centers > Guest Access > Portals & Components > Sponsor Portals > Edit > Portal Page Customization.
For Device portals, choose Administration > Device Portal Management > (any Portals) > Edit > Portal Page Customization.
Step 2

Step 4
Click Delete and then Save.
View Your Customization
You can view how your customization will display to the portal users (guests, sponsors, or employees).
Procedure
Step 1
Click Portal test URL to view your changes.
Step 2
(Optional) Click Preview to dynamically view how your changes appear on various devices:
Mobile devices: View your changes under Preview.
Desktop devices: Click Preview and then click Desktop Preview.
If the changes are not displayed, click Refresh Preview. The portal displayed is only meant for viewing your changes; you cannot click buttons or enter data.
Note 
The test portal does not support RADIUS sessions, so you won't see the entire portal flow for all portals. BYOD and Client Provisioning are examples of portals that depend on RADIUS sessions. If you have more than one PSN, Cisco ISE chooses the first active PSN.
Portal Language Customization
The Guest, Sponsor, My Devices, and Client Provisioning portals are localized into all supported languages and locales. This includes text, labels, messages, field names, and button labels. If the client browser requests a locale that is not mapped to a template in Cisco ISE, the portals display content using the English template.
Using the Admin portal, you can modify the fields used for the Guest, Sponsor, and My Devices portals for each language individually, and you can add more languages. Currently, you cannot customize these fields for the Client Provisioning portal.
By default, each type of portal supports 15 languages. You select which language a portal uses, and optionally update page content for that language, on the Portal Page Customization window. Note, if you change fonts and content on the page for one language, those changes to not carry over into the other languages. The changes you make on the Portal Page Customization window are included when you export the Lanaguage File.
The supported languages are:
Chinese Simplified
Chinese Traditional
Czech
Dutch
English
French
German
Hungarian
Italian
Japanese
Korean
Polish
Portuguese
Russian
Spanish

Note
NAC and MAC agent installers and WebAgent pages are not localized.
To Edit the Language Used by a Portal
Open the portal that you want to edit.
On the Portal Page Customization tab, select the language that you want to edit in the view in drop-down list.
Change content, headings, and fonts as desired.
Save that portal configuration, and repeat this flow for the other languages that you want to update.
To Edit the Language File
Each Portal Page Customization window also provides a Language File. The Language File is a ZIP of attribute files that you can use to customize headings and text that are part of the portal flow, but is not available to customize on the Portal Page Customization window.
The Language File also contains the mapping to the particular browser locale setting along with all of the string settings for the entire portal in that language. If you change the browser locale setting for one language, the change is applied to all the other end-user web portals. For example, if you change the French.properties browser locale from fr,fr-fr,fr-ca to fr,fr-fr in the Hotspot Guest portal, the change is applied to the My Devices portal also.
You can export the zipped language file and make updates to it, including adding new languages or deleting existing ones you do not need.
For instructions about how to update the Language File, see:
Export the Language File
Add or Delete Languages from the Language File
Import the Updated Language File
Export the Language File
Add or Delete Languages from the Language File
Import the Updated Language File
Export the Language File
You can export the language file available for each portal type to edit and customize the existing values specified in it, and add or delete a language.

Note
Only some of the dictionary keys in the language properties files support HTML in their values (text).
Procedure
Step 1
Navigate to these portals:
For Guest portals, choose Work Centers > Guest Access > Portals & Components > Edit .
For Sponsor portals, choose Work Centers > Configure > Portals & Components > Sponsor Portals > Edit .
For Device portals, choose Administration > Device Portal Management > (any Portals) > Edit .
Step 2
Click Language File and choose Export from the drop-down list.
Step 3
Save the zipped language file to your desktop.
Add or Delete Languages from the Language File
If a language you want to use for your portal type is missing from the language file, you can create a new language properties file and add it to the zipped language file. If there are languages you do not need, you can delete their language properties files.
Before you begin
Export the zipped language file available with each portal type in order to add or delete language properties files.
Procedure
Step 1
Use any editor that displays UTF-8 (such as Notepad ++) to open the predefined language file for the portal type to which you want to add or delete languages.
If you want to add or delete languages for more than one portal type, use all the appropriate portal properties files.
Step 2
To add a new language, save an existing language properties file as the new language properties file using the same naming convention of the other files in the zipped language file. For example, to create a new Japanese language properties file, save the file as Japanese.properties (LanguageName.properties).
Step 3
Associate the new language with its browser locale by specifying the browser local value in the first line of the new language properties file. For example, LocaleKeys= ja,ja-jp (LocaleKeys=browser locale value) should be the first line in the Japanese.properties file.
Step 4
Update all the values (text) of the dictionary keys in the new language properties file.
You cannot change the dictionary keys. You can update only their values.
Note 
Only some of the dictionary keys support HTML in their values (text).
What to do next
Zip all the properties files (new and existing) and create a new zipped language file. Do not include any folders or directories.

Note
When using a Mac, extracting the ZIP file produces a DS store. When you compress the language file after editing, do not include the DS store in the ZIP. To learn methods of extracting the DS store, see https://superuser.com/questions/198569/compressing-folders-on-a-mac-without-the-ds-store.
Use a new name or its original name for the zipped language file.
Import the zipped language file into the specific portal you exported it from.
Import the Updated Language File
You can import an edited language file that you have customized by adding or deleting language properties files or by updating text in existing properties files.

Note
Ensure that you do not copy and paste customization content from Word files. Alternately, choose File > Save As and save the Word file in HTML format. You can then copy and paste customization content from the HTML file.
Procedure
Step 1
Navigate to these portals:
For Guest portals, choose Work Centers > Guest Access > Portals & Components > Guest Portals > Edit .
For Sponsor portals, choose Work Centers > Guest Access > Portals & Components > Sponsor Portals > Edit .
For Device portals, choose Administration > Device Portal Management > (any Portals) > Edit .
Step 2
Click Language File and choose Import from the drop-down list.
Step 3
Browse to find the new zipped language file on your desktop.
Step 4
Import it back for the portal type from where you exported it.
What to do next
To display the changed text or the new language you added, select the specific language from the View In drop-down list.
