General Node Settings
The following table describes the fields on the General Settings window of a Cisco ISE node. In this window, you can assign a persona to a node and configure the services to be run on it. The navigation path for this window is: Administration > System > Deployment > Deployment Node > Edit > General Settings.
Table 2. General Node Settings
Field Name Usage Guidelines
Hostname Displays the hostname of the Cisco ISE node.
FQDN Displays the fully qualified domain name of the Cisco ISE node, for example, ise1.cisco.com.
IP Address Displays the IP address of the Cisco ISE node.
Node Type Displays the node type.
Personas
Administration
Check this check box if you want a Cisco ISE node to assume the Administration persona. You can enable the Administration persona only on nodes that are licensed to provide the administrative services.
Role: Displays the role that the Administration persona has assumed in the deployment. The persona can take any one of the following values: Standalone, Primary, or Secondary.
Make Primary: Click this button to make this node your primary Cisco ISE node. You can have only one primary Cisco ISE node in a deployment. The other options in this window will become active only after you make this node primary. You can have only two Administration nodes in a deployment. If the node has a Standalone role, the Make Primary button appears next to it. If the node has a Secondary role, the Promote to Primary button appears next to it. If the node has a Primary role and there are no other nodes registered with it, the Make Standalone button appears next to it. You can click the Make Standalone button to make your primary node a standalone node.
Monitoring
Check this check box if you want a Cisco ISE node to assume the Monitoring persona and function as your log collector. There must be at least one Monitoring node in a distributed deployment. At the time of configuring your primary PAN, you must enable the Monitoring persona. After you register a secondary Monitoring node in your deployment, you can edit the primary PAN and disable the Monitoring persona, if required.
To configure a Cisco ISE node on a VMware platform as your log collector, use the following guidelines to determine the minimum amount of disk space that you need: 180 KB per endpoint in your network, per day 2.5 MB per Cisco ISE node in your network, per day.
You can calculate the maximum disk space that you need based on how many months of data you want to have in your Monitoring node. If there is only one Monitoring node in your deployment, it assumes the standalone role. If you have two Monitoring nodes in your deployment, Cisco ISE displays the name of the other Monitoring node for you to configure the primary-secondary roles. To configure these roles, choose one of the following:
Primary: For the current node to be the primary Monitoring node.
Secondary: For the current node to be the secondary Monitoring node.
None: If you do not want the Monitoring nodes to assume the primary-secondary roles.
If you configure one of your Monitoring nodes as primary or secondary, the other Monitoring node automatically becomes the secondary or primary node, respectively. Both the primary and secondary Monitoring nodes receive Administration and Policy Service logs. If you change the role for one Monitoring node to None, the role of the other Monitoring node also becomes None, thereby cancelling the high availability pair after you designate a node as a Monitoring node. You will find this node listed as a syslog target in the Remote Logging Targets window: Administration > System > Logging > Remote Logging Targets.
Policy Service Check this check box to enable any one or all of the following services:
Enable Session Services: Check this check box to enable network access, posture, guest, and client-provisioning services. Choose the group to which this Policy Service node belongs from the Include Node in Node Group drop-down list. Note that Certificate Authority (CA) and Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) services can only run on a Policy Service node that has session services enabled on it.
For Include Node in Node Group, choose None if you do not want this Policy Service node to be a part of any group.
All the nodes within the same node group should be configured on the network access device (NAD) as RADIUS clients and authorized for CoA, because any one of them can issue a CoA request for the sessions that are established through any node in the node group. If you are not using a load balancer, the nodes in a node group should be the same as, or a subset of the RADIUS servers and clients configured on the NAD. These nodes would also be configured as RADIUS servers.
While a single NAD can be configured with many Cisco ISE nodes as RADIUS servers and dynamic-authorization clients, it is not necessary for all the nodes to be in the same node group.
The members of a node group should be connected to each other using high-speed LAN connection such as Gigabit Ethernet. The node group members need not be L2 adjacent, but L2 adjacency is highly recommended to ensure sufficient bandwidth and reachability. See the Create a Policy Service Node Group section for more details.
Enable Profiling Service: Check this check box to enable the Profiling service. If you enable the Profiling service, you must click the Profiling Configuration tab and enter the details as required. When you enable or disable any of the services that run on the Policy Service node or make any changes to this node, you will be restarting the application server processes on which these services run. Expect a delay while these services restart. You can determine when the application server has restarted on a node by using the show application status ise command from the CLI.
Enable Threat-Centric NAC Service: Check this check box to enable the Threat-Centric Network Access Control (TC-NAC) feature. This feature allows you to create authorization policies based on the threat and vulnerability attributes received from the threat and vulnerability adapters. Threat severity levels and vulnerability assessment results can be used to dynamically control the access level of an endpoint or a user.
Enable SXP Service: Check this check box to enable SXP service on the node. You must also specify the interface to be used for SXP service.
If you have configured NIC bonding or teaming, the bonded interfaces are also listed along with the physical interfaces in the Use Interface drop-down list.
Enable Device Admin Service: Check this check box to create TACACS policy sets, policy results, and so on, to control and audit the configuration of network devices.
Enable Passive Identity Service: Check this check box to enable the Identity Mapping feature. This feature enables you to monitor users who are authenticated by a Domain Controller and not by Cisco ISE. In networks where Cisco ISE does not actively authenticate users for network access, you can use the Identity Mapping feature to collect user authentication information from the Active Directory Domain Controller.
pxGrid Check this check box to enable the pxGrid persona. Cisco pxGrid is used to share the context-sensitive information from the Cisco ISE session directory to other policy network systems such as Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA). The pxGrid framework can also be used to exchange policy and configuration data between nodes, for example, sharing tags and policy objects between Cisco ISE and third-party vendors, and for non-Cisco ISE-related information exchanges such as threat information.

Field Name
Usage Guidelines
Certificate Issuer
Friendly Name
Enter a friendly name for the certificate. This is an optional field. If you do not enter a friendly name, a default name is generated in the following format:
common-name#issuer#nnnnn
Status
Choose Enabled or Disabled from the drop-down list. If the certificate is disabled, Cisco ISE will not use the certificate for establishing trust.
Description
(Optional) Enter a description.
Usage
Trust for authentication within ISE
Check this check box if you want this certificate to verify server certificates (from other Cisco ISE nodes or LDAP servers).
Trust for client authentication and Syslog
(Applicable only if you check the Trust for authentication within ISE check box) Check the check box if you want this certificate to be used to:
Authenticate endpoints that connect to Cisco ISE using the EAP protocol.
Trust a Syslog server.
Trust for authentication of Cisco Services
Check this check box if you want this certificate to be used to trust external Cisco services such as the Feed Service.
Certificate Status Validation
Cisco ISE supports two ways of checking the revocation status of a client or server certificate that is issued by a particular CA. The first way is to validate the certificate using the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP), which makes a request to an OCSP service maintained by the CA. The second way is to validate the certificate against a CRL which is downloaded from the CA into Cisco ISE. Both of these methods can be enabled, in which case OCSP is used first and only if a status determination cannot be made then the CRL is used.
Validate Against OCSP Service
Check the check box to validate the certificate against OCSP services. You must first create an OCSP Service to be able to check this box.
Reject the request if OCSP returns UNKNOWN status
Check the check box to reject the request if certificate status is not determined by the OCSP service. If you check this check box, an unknown status value that is returned by the OCSP service causes Cisco ISE to reject the client or server certificate currently being evaluated.
Reject the request if OCSP Responder is unreachable
Check the check box for Cisco ISE to reject the request if the OCSP Responder is not reachable.
Download CRL
Check the check box for the Cisco ISE to download a CRL.
CRL Distribution URL
Enter the URL to download the CRL from a CA. This field is automatically populated if it is specified in the certificate authority certificate. The URL must begin with “http”, “https”, or “ldap.”
Retrieve CRL
The CRL can be downloaded automatically or periodically. Configure the time interval between downloads.
If download failed, wait
Configure the time interval that Cisco ISE must wait Cisco ISE tries to download the CRL again.
Bypass CRL Verification if CRL is not Received
Check this check box, for the client requests to be accepted before the CRL is received. If you uncheck this check box, all client requests that use certificates signed by the selected CA will be rejected until Cisco ISE receives the CRL file.
Ignore that CRL is not yet valid or expired
Check this check box if you want Cisco ISE to ignore the start date and expiration date and continue to use the not yet active or expired CRL and permit or reject the EAP-TLS authentications based on the contents of the CRL.
Uncheck this check box if you want Cisco ISE to check the CRL file for the start date in the Effective Date field and the expiration date in the Next Update field. If the CRL is not yet active or has expired, all authentications that use certificates signed by this CA are rejected.

Generate a Self-Signed Certificate
Certificate-Signing Request Settings
Cisco ISE allows you to generate certificate-signing requests for all the nodes in your deployment from the Admin portal in a single request. Also, you can choose to generate the certificate signing request for a single node or multiple both nodes in the deployment. If you choose to generate a certificate signing request for a single node, ISE automatically substitutes the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the particular node in the CN= field of the certificate subject. If you choose to include an entry in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field of the certificate, you must enter the FQDN of the ISE node in addition to other SAN attributes. If you choose to generate certificate signing requests for all the nodes in your deployment, check the Allow Wildcard Certificates check box and enter the wildcard FQDN notation in the SAN field (DNS name), for example, *.amer.example.com. If you plan to use the certificate for EAP Authentication, do not enter the wildcard value in the CN= field.
With the use of wildcard certificates, you no longer have to generate a unique certificate for each Cisco ISE node. Also, you no longer have to populate the SAN field with multiple FQDN values to prevent certificate warnings. Using an asterisk (*) in the SAN field allows you to share a single certificate across multiple both nodes in a deployment and helps prevent certificate name mismatch warnings. However, use of wildcard certificates is considered less secure than assigning a unique server certificate for each Cisco ISE node.
Table 6. Certificate-Signing Request Settings
Field Usage Guidelines
Certificate(s) will be used for
Choose the service for which you are going to use the certificate:
Cisco ISE Identity Certificates
Multi-Use: Used for multiple services (Admin, EAP-TLS Authentication, pxGrid, and Portal). Multi-use certificates use both client and server key usages. The certificate template on the signing CA is often called a Computer or Machine certificate template. This template has the following properties:
Key Usage: Digital Signature (Signing)
Extended Key Usage: TLS Web Server Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1) and TLS Web Client Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2)
Admin: Used for server authentication (to secure communication with the Admin portal and between ISE nodes in a deployment). The certificate template on the signing CA is often called a Web Server certificate template. This template has the following properties:
Key Usage: Digital Signature (Signing)
Extended Key Usage: TLS Web Server Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1)
EAP Authentication: Used for server authentication. The certificate template on the signing CA is often called a Computer or Machine certificate template. This template has the following properties:
Key Usage: Digital Signature (Signing)
Extended Key Usage: TLS Web Server Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1)
Note 
Digital signature key usage is required for EAP-TLS client certificates.

Extended Key Usage: TLS Web Server Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1)
pxGrid: Used for both client and server authentication (to secure communication between the pxGrid client and server). The certificate template on the signing CA is often called a Computer or Machine certificate template. This template has the following properties:
Key Usage: Digital Signature (Signing)
Extended Key Usage: TLS Web Server Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1) and TLS Web Client Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2)
SAML: Server certificate used to secure communication with the SAML Identity Provider (IdP). A certificate designated for SAML use cannot be used for any other service such as Admin, EAP authentication, and so on.
Key Usage: Digital Signature (Signing)
Extended Key Usage: TLS Web Server Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1)
Note 
We recommend that you do not use a certificate that contains the value of 2.5.29.37.0 for the Any Purpose object identifier in the Extended Key Usage attribute. If you use a certificate that contains the value of 2.5.29.37.0 for the Any Purpose object identifier in the Extended Key Usage attribute, the certificate is considered invalid and the following error message is displayed:
source=local ; type=fatal ; message="unsupported certificate"
Cisco ISE Certificate Authority Certificates
ISE Root CA: (Applicable only for the internal CA service ) Used for regenerating the entire internal CA certificate chain including the root CA on the Primary PAN and subordinate CAs on the PSNs.
ISE Intermediate CA: (Applicable only for the internal CA service when ISE acts as an intermediate CA of an external PKI) Used to generate an intermediate CA certificate on the Primary PAN and subordinate CA certificates on the PSNs. The certificate template on the signing CA is often called a Subordinate Certificate Authority. This template has the following properties:
Basic Constraints: Critical, Is a Certificate Authority
Key Usage: Certificate Signing, Digital Signature
Extended Key Usage: OCSP Signing (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.9)
Renew ISE OCSP Responder Certificates: (Applicable only for the internal CA service) Used to renew the ISE OCSP responder certificate for the entire deployment (and is not a certificate signing request). For security reasons, we recommend that you renew the ISE OCSP responder certificates every six months.
Allow Wildcard Certificates
Check this check box to use a wildcard character (*) in the CN and/or the DNS name in the SAN field of the certificate. If you check this check box, all the nodes in the deployment are selected automatically. You must use the asterisk (*) wildcard character in the left-most label position. If you use wildcard certificates, we recommend that you partition your domain space for greater security. For example, instead of *.example.com, you can partition it as *.amer.example.com. If you do not partition your domain, it might lead to security issues.
Generate CSRs for these Nodes
Check the check boxes next to the nodes for which you want to generate the certificate. To generate a CSR for select nodes in the deployment, you must uncheck the Allow Wildcard Certificates option.
Common Name (CN)
By default, the common name is the FQDN of the ISE node for which you are generating the certificate signing request. $FQDN$ denotes the FQDN of the ISE node. When you generate certificate signing requests for multiple nodes in the deployment, the Common Name field in the certificate signing requests is replaced with the FQDN of the respective ISE nodes.
Organizational Unit (OU)
Organizational Unit name. For example, Engineering.
Organization (O)
Organization name. For example, Cisco.
City (L)
(Do not abbreviate) City name. For example, San Jose.
State (ST)
(Do not abbreviate) State name. For example, California.
Country (C)
Country name. You must enter the two-letter ISO country code. For example, US.
Subject Alternative Name (SAN)
An IP address, DNS name, Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), or Directory Name that is associated with the certificate.
DNS Name: If you choose the DNS name, enter the fully qualified domain name of the ISE node. If you have enabled the Allow Wildcard Certificates option, specify the wildcard notation (an asterisk and a period before the domain name). For example, *.amer.example.com.
IP Address: IP address of the ISE node to be associated with the certificate.
Uniform Resource Identifier: A URI that you want to associate with the certificate.
Directory Name: A string representation of distinguished name(s) (DNs) defined per RFC 2253. Use a comma (,) to separate the DNs. For “dnQualifier” RDN, escape the comma and use backslash-comma “\,” as separator. For example, CN=AAA,dnQualifier=O=Example\,DC=COM,C=IL
Key Length
Choose 2048 or greater if you plan to get a public CA-signed certificate or deploy Cisco ISE as a FIPS-compliant policy management system.
Digest to Sign With
Choose one of the following hashing algorithm: SHA-1 or SHA-256.

Description
Certificate File
Click Browse to choose the certificate file from the computer that is running the browser.
Friendly Name
Enter a friendly name for the certificate. If you do not specify a name, Cisco ISE automatically creates a name in the format <common name># <issuer># <nnnnn>, where <nnnnn> is a unique five-digit number.
Trust for authentication within ISE
Check the check box if you want this certificate to be used to verify server certificates (from other ISE nodes or LDAP servers).
Trust for client authentication and Syslog
(Applicable only if you check the Trust for authentication within ISE check box) Check the check box if you want this certificate to be used to:
Authenticate endpoints that connect to ISE using the EAP protocol
Trust a Syslog server
Trust for authentication of Cisco Services
Check this check box if you want this certificate to be used to trust external Cisco services such as the feed service.

Configure OCSP Responder
Enable Secondary Server
Check this check box to enable a secondary OCSP server for high availability.
Always Access Primary Server First
Use this option to check the primary server before trying to move to the secondary server. Even if the primary was checked earlier and found to be unresponsive, Cisco ISE will try to send a request to the primary server before moving to the secondary server.
Fallback to Primary Server After Interval n Minutes
Use this option when you want Cisco ISE to move to the secondary server and then fall back to the primary server again. In this case, all other requests are skipped, and the secondary server is used for the amount of time that is configured in the text box. The allowed time range is 1 to 999 minutes.
Primary and Secondary Servers
URL
Enter the URL of the primary and/or secondary OCSP server.
Enable Nonce Extension Support
You can configure a nonce to be sent as part of the OCSP request. The Nonce includes a pseudo-random number in the OCSP request. It is verified that the number that is received in the response is the same as the number that is included in the request. This option ensures that old communications cannot be reused in replay attacks.
Validate Response Signature
The OCSP responder signs the response with one of the following certificates:
The CA certificate
A certificate different from the CA certificate
In order for Cisco ISE to validate the response signature, the OCSP responder needs to send the response along with the certificate, otherwise the response verification fails, and the status of the certificate cannot be relied on. According to the RFC, OCSP can sign the response using different certificates. This is true as long as OCSP sends the certificate that signed the response for Cisco ISE to validate it. If OCSP signs the response with a different certificate that is not configured in Cisco ISE, the response verification will fail.
Use OCSP URLs specified in Authority Information Access (AIA)
Click the radio button to use the OCSP URLs specified in the Authority Information Access extension.
Response Cache
Cache Entry Time To Live n Minutes
Enter the time in minutes after which the cache entry expires. Each response from the OCSP server holds a nextUpdate value. This value shows when the status of the certificate will be updated next on the server. When the OCSP response is cached, the two values (one from the configuration and another from response) are compared, and the response is cached for the period of time that is the lowest value of these two. If the nextUpdate value is 0, the response is not cached at all. Cisco ISE will cache OCSP responses for the configured time. The cache is not replicated or persistent, so when Cisco ISE restarts, the cache is cleared. The OCSP cache is used in order to maintain the OCSP responses and for the following reasons:
To reduce network traffic and load from the OCSP servers on an already-known certificate
To increase the performance of Cisco ISE by caching already-known certificate statuses
By default, the cache is set to 2 minutes for the internal CA OCSP client profile. If an endpoint authenticates a second time within 2 minutes of the first authentication, the OCSP cache is used and the OCSP responder is not queried. If the endpoint certificate has been revoked within the cache period, the previous OCSP status of Good will be used and the authentication succeeds. Setting the cache to 0 minutes prevents any responses from being cached. This option improves security, but decreases authentication performance.
Clear Cache
Click Clear Cache to clear entries of all the certificate authorities that are connected to the OCSP service.
In a deployment, Clear Cache interacts with all the nodes and performs the operation. This mechanism updates every node in the deployment.

Enforcement Type
Choose the action to be enforced:
Continue: The user continues to have the privileged access without any user intervention to remediate the client irrespective of the posture requirement.
Logoff: If the client is not compliant, the user is forced to logoff from the network. When the client logs in again, the compliance status is unknown.
Remediate: If the client is not compliant, the agent waits for a specified time for the remediation to happen. Once the client has remediated, the agent sends the PRA report to the policy service node. If the remediation is ignored on the client, then the agent sends a logoff request to the policy service node to force the client to logoff from the network.
If the posture requirement is set to mandatory, then the RADIUS session will be cleared as a result of the PRA failure action and a new RADIUS session has to start for the client to be postured again.
If the posture requirement is set to optional, then the agent on the client allows the user to click the continue option from the agent. The user can continue to stay in the current network without any restriction.

Trustsec PAC
Click this radio button to generate a Trustsec PAC.
Identity
(For Tunnel and Machine PAC) Specifies the username or machine name that is presented as the “inner username” by the EAP-FAST protocol. If the identity string does not match that username, authentication fails.
This is the hostname as defined on the Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA). The identity string must match the ASA hostname otherwise, ASA cannot import the PAC file that is generated.
If you are generating a Trustsec PAC, the Identity field specifies the Device ID of a Trustsec network device and is provided with an initiator ID by the EAP-FAST protocol. If the Identity string entered here does not match that Device ID, authentication fails.
PAC Time to Live
(For Tunnel and Machine PAC) Enter a value in seconds that specifies the expiration time for the PAC. The default is 604800 seconds, which is equivalent to one week. This value must be a positive integer between 1 and 157680000 seconds. For the Trustsec PAC, enter a value in days, weeks, months, or years. By default, the value is one year. The minimum value is one day and the maximum is 10 years.
Encryption Key
Enter an encryption key. The length of the key must be between 8 and 256 characters. The key can contain uppercase or lowercase letters, or numbers, or a combination of alphanumeric characters.

Field Name
Usage Guidelines
Enable EAP-TTLS Session Resume
If you check this check box, Cisco ISE will cache the TLS session that is created during phase one of EAP-TTLS authentication, provided the user successfully authenticates in phase two of EAP-TTLS. If a user needs to reconnect and the original EAP-TTLS session has not timed out, Cisco ISE uses the cached TLS session, resulting in faster EAP-TTLS performance and a reduced AAA server load.
Note 
When the EAP-TTLS session is resumed, the inner method is skipped.
EAP-TTLS Session Timeout
Specifies the time in seconds after which the EAP-TTLS session times out. The default value is 7200 seconds.

RADIUS Settings
If you enable the Suppress Repeated Failed Clients option, clients with repeated authentication failures will be suppressed from the audit logs, and the requests from these clients will be automatically rejected for the specified time period. You can also specify the number of authentication failures after which the requests from these clients should be rejected. For example, if this value is configured as 5, when a client authentication fails five times, all the requests received from that client will be rejected for the configured time period.

Note
If the cause of authentication failure is entry of wrong password, the client will not be suppressed.

Note
If you configure suppression of RADIUS failures, you may still receive the error "5440 Endpoint Abandoned EAP Session and started a new one" after you configure RADIUS log suppression. For more information, see the following ISE Community post:

DHCP and DNS Services
Use these settings to configure a DHCP, and optionally DNS, to enable Auth VLAN URL redirect simulation. You can create multiple scopes in order to apply them to different ISE nodes. If you apply multiple scopes to one ISE node, they should be configured on the same network interface.

Note
For Profiling, you may need a DHCP probe. ISE DHCP probe uses the same UDP port 67 as the Auth VLAN DHCP service. Therefore the DHCP probe should be configured on a different interface or can be disabled on this ISE node. For more information about DHCP probes, see DHCP Probe.
Table 31. DHCP & DNS Service Settings for Auth VLAN URL Redirect Simulation
Field Name Usage Guidelines
Scope Name
Enter a name by which you can easily remember the purpose of this scope.
Status
Select Enabled or Disabled. The scope can only be used for an ISE node when enabled.
ISE Node
Apply an ISE node to act as the DHCP/DNS server. From the dropdown list, select the ISE node with which to use this scope. The Auth VLAN is defined per ISE node or network interface and no two interfaces or two nodes can share the same VLAN.
Network Interface
The network interfaces available for the ISE node that you selected appear in this dropdown list dynamically based on the ISE node that you selected. Select the interface from which the DHCP/DNS server listens. Multiple VLANs may be connected to one network interface card by configuring a VLAN IP-helper on the NAD.
Domain Name
Enter the domain name for the DHCP server to be used in this scope.
DHCP Address range
Based on your network definitions, select the range of DHCP addresses available to be used for this scope.
Subnet mask
Based on your network definitions, select the network mask to be used for this scope.
Network ID
Automatically determined by Cisco ISE based on the DHCP attributes you enter.
Exclusion address range
Based on your network definitions, select the range of DHCP addresses that should not be used for this scope.
Default gateway
Enter the IP address of the default gateway.
DHCP lease time
Define the the DHCP lease time.
DHCP options
(Optional) DHCP options are added configuration parameters that a DCHP server send to DHCP clients. DHCP options provide support for devices such as cameras, access points, or phones that require the information indicated in the option value to access the network, or as a method to bootstrap the device before final authorization. When the DHCP server receives the DHCP Request message from the client, the server (typically) responds by sending a DHCP ACK packet to the client. At this time, the server then forwards any configured options within the DHCP ACK packet.
For more details, see the DHCP Options section below this table.
External DNS servers
If you would like users to be allowed access to external domains outside of the Auth VLAN before receiving authentication to access the entire corporate network, enter the IP addresses of the DNS servers to resolve the external DNS names.
External Domains
If you would like users to be allowed to access a specific site before receiving authentication to access the entire corporate network, enter the domain names of those sites in these fields.
Enter the names of all the child domains that users may need access to, apart from the parent domain.
DHCP Options
When configuring a DHCP service in ISE, you can assign specific DHCP options for clients that connect to the Auth VLAN. You can add multiple DHCP options to each scope that you define.
The options available in the dropdown list are as taken from RFC 2132. You can also add additional customized options (from RFC 2132) by selecting Custom from the dropdown list and entering the option code.
In general, there are several DHCP options that tend to be used most frequently. Common options include:
Option 12 (Hostname): used to carry the “hostname” portion of a node’s Fully Qualified Domain Name. For example, "mail" of mail.ise.com.
Option 42 (NTP Servers): carries the NTP servers used on the network.
Option 66 (TFTP Server): used to carry the IP address or hostname. This option is available in the dropdown list.
Option 82 (DHCP Relay Agent): used to carry other sub options for server side dhcp relay server information.
To define the option value, select an option from the dropdown list. The code and type populate automatically if you select a pre-defined Option.
If you select Custom, enter the Code and Value. The Type field is updated automatically.
Figure 1. DHCP Options
For example:
To set a hostname: From the Option drop-down list, choose Custom. Enter the code in the Code field (for example, 15). The Type field is automatically populated as Text. Enter the hostname in the Value field.
To set a TFTP Server Name: From the Option drop-down list, choose the TFTP server name. Code and Type fields are updated automatically. In the Value field, type the TFTP server hostname.

Note
Some of the DHCP options can not be manually entered because they are automatically defined for ISE.
To enter multiple options click the plus sign under Actions.

You can toggle the status of static assignment of an endpoint from static to dynamic or from dynamic to static.
Policy Assignment
(Disabled by default unless the Static Assignment is checked) Choose a matching endpoint policy from the Policy Assignment drop-down list.
You can do one of the following:
If you do not choose a matching endpoint policy, but use the default endpoint policy Unknown, then the static assignment status is set to dynamic for the endpoint that allows dynamic profiling of an endpoint.
If you choose a matching endpoint policy other than Unknown, then the static assignment status is set to static for that endpoint and the Static Assignment check box is automatically checked.
Static Group Assignment
Check this check box when you want to assign an endpoint to an identity group statically.
In you check this check box, the profiling service does not change the endpoint identity group the next time during evaluation of the endpoint policy for these endpoints, which were previously assigned dynamically to other endpoint identity groups.
If you uncheck this check box, then the endpoint identity group is dynamic as assigned by the ISE profiler based on policy configuration. If you do not choose the Static Group Assignment option, then the endpoint is automatically assigned to the matching identity group the next time during evaluation of the endpoint policy.
Identity Group Assignment
Choose an endpoint identity group to which you want to assign the endpoint.
You can assign an endpoint to an identity group when you create an endpoint statically, or when you do not want to use the Create Matching Identity Group option during evaluation of the endpoint policy for an endpoint.

Support for Session Aware Networking (SAnet)
Cisco ISE provides limited support for Session Aware Networking (SAnet). SAnet is a session management framework that runs on many Cisco switches. SAnet manages access sessions, including visibility, authentication, and authorization. SAnet uses a service template, which contains RADIUS authorization attributes. Cisco ISE includes a service template inside an authorization profile. Cisco ISE identifies service templates in an authorization profile using a flag that identifies the profile as “Service Template” compatible.
Cisco ISE authorization profiles contain RADIUS authorization attributes that are transformed into a list of attributes. SAnet service templates also contain of RADIUS authorization attributes, but those attributes are not transformed into a list.
For SAnet devices, Cisco ISE sends the name of the service template. The device downloads the content of the service template, unless it already has that content in a cache or statically defined configuration. Cisco ISE sends a CoA notification to the device when a service template changes RADIUS attributes.

Advanced Attribute Settings
Strip Start of Subject Name up to the First Occurrence of the Separator
Check this check box to strip the username from the prefix. For example, if the subject name is acme\userA and the separator is \, the username becomes userA.
Strip End of Subject Name from the Last Occurrence of the Separator
Check this check box to strip the username from the suffix. For example, if the subject name is userA@abc.com and the separator is @, the username becomes userA.
You must enable the strip options to extract the username from NetBIOS or User Principle Name (UPN) format usernames (user@domain.com or /domain/user), because only usernames are passed to the RADIUS server for authenticating the user.
If you activate both the \ and @ stripping functions, and you are using Cisco AnyConnect, Cisco ISE does not accurately trim the first \ from the string. However, each stripping function that is used individually, works as it is designed with Cisco AnyConnect.
Modify Attributes in the Request to the External RADIUS Server
Check this check box to allow Cisco ISE to manipulate attributes that come from or go to the authenticated RADIUS server.
The attribute manipulation operations include these:
Add: Add additional attributes to the overall RADIUS request/response.
Update: Change the attribute value (fixed or static) or substitute an attribute by another attribute value (dynamic).
Remove: Remove an attribute or an attribute-value pair.
RemoveAny: Remove any occurrences of the attribute.
Continue to Authorization Policy
Check this check box to divert the proxy flow to run the authorization policy for further decision making, based on identity store group and attribute retrieval. If you enable this option, attributes from the response of the external RADIUS server will be applicable for the authentication policy selection. Attributes that are already in the context will be updated with the appropriate value from the AAA server accept response attribute.
Modify Attributes before send an Access-Accept
Check this check box to modify the attribute just before sending a response back to the device.

Portal Name: Enter a unique portal name to access this portal. Do not use this portal name for any other Sponsor, Guest, or nonguest portals, such as Blacklist, Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), Client Provisioning, Mobile Device Management (MDM), or My Devices portals.
This name appears in the authorization profile portal selection for redirection choices. It is applied to the list of portals for easy identification among other portals.
Description: Optional.
Portal Test URL: A system-generated URL displays as a link after you click Save. Use it to test the portal.
Click the link to open a new browser tab that displays the URL for this portal. Policy Services Node (PSN) with Policy Services must be turned on. If Policy Services are disabled, the PSN only displays the Admin portal.

Note
The test portal does not support RADIUS sessions, so you won't see the entire portal flow for all portals. BYOD and Client Provisioning are examples of portals that depend on RADIUS sessions. For example, a redirect to an external URL will not work. If you have more than one PSN, Cisco ISE chooses the first active PSN.
Language File: Each portal type supports 15 languages by default, which are available as individual properties files bundled together in a single zipped language file. Export or import the zipped language file to use with the portal. The zipped language file contains all the individual language files that you can use to display text for the portal.
The language file contains the mapping to the particular browser locale setting along with all of the string settings for the entire portal in that language. A single language file contains all the supported languages, so that it can easily be used for translation and localization purposes.
If you change the browser locale setting for one language, the change is applied to all the other end-user web portals. For example, if you change the French.properties browser locale from fr,fr-fr,fr-ca to fr,fr-fr in the Hotspot Guest portal, the changes also apply to the My Devices portal.
An alert icon displays when you customize any of the text on the Portal Page Customizations tab. The alert message reminds you that any changes made to one language while customizing the portal must also be added to all the supported languages properties files. You can manually dismiss the alert icon using the drop-down list option; or it is automatically dismissed after you import the updated zipped language file.

The navigation path for this window is: Administration > Device Portal Management > Blacklist Portal > Edit > Portal Behavior and Flow Settings > Portal Settings.
Use these settings to specify values or define behavior that applies to the overall portal; not just to specific portal pages that display to the user (guests, sponsors, or employees as applicable).
HTTPS Port: Enter a port value between 8000 to 8999; the default value is 8443 for all the default portals, except the Blacklist Portal, which is 8444. If you upgraded with port values outside this range, they are honored until you modify this window. If you modify this window, update the port setting to comply with this restriction.
If you assign ports used by a non-guest (such as My Devices) portal to a guest portal, an error message appears.
For posture assessments and remediation only, the Client Provisioning portal also uses ports 8905 and 8909. Otherwise, it uses the same ports assigned to the Guest portal.
Portals assigned to the same HTTPS port can use the same Gigabit Ethernet interface or another interface. If they use the same port and interface combination, they must use the same certificate group tag. For example:
Valid combinations include, using the Sponsor portal as an example:
Sponsor portal: Port 8443, Interface 0, Certificate tag A and My Devices portal: Port 8443, Interface 0, Certificate group A.
Sponsor portal: Port 8443, Interface 0, Certificate group A and My Devices portal: Port 8445, Interface 0, Certificate group B.
Sponsor portal: Port 8444, Interface 1, Certificate group A and Blacklist portal: Port 8444, Interface 0, Certificate group B.
Invalid combinations include:
Sponsor portal: Port 8443, Interface 0, Certificate group A and My Devices portal: 8443, Interface 0, Certificate group B.
Sponsor portal: Port 8444, Interface 0, Certificate tag A and Blacklist portal: Port 8444, Interface 0, Certificate group A.

Note
We recommend that you use interface 0 for Guest services for best performance. You can either configure only interface 0 in the Portal Settings, or you can use the CLI command ip host to map a hostname or FQDN to the IP address of interface 0.
Allowed Interfaces: Select the PSN interfaces which a PAN can use to run a portal. When a request to open a portal is made on the PAN, the PAN looks for an available allowed port on the PSN. You must configure the Ethernet interfaces using IP addresses on different subnets.
These interfaces must be available on all the PSNs, including VM-based ones, that have Policy Services turned on. This is a requirement because any of these PSNs can be used for the redirect at the start of the guest session.

Configure ip host x.x.x.x yyy.domain.com in Cisco ISE CLI to map the secondary interface IP address to the FQDN, which is used to match the certificate Subject Name or Alternate Subject Name.
If only the bonded NIC is selected, when the PSN attempts to configure the portal it first attempts to configure the Bond interface. If that is not successful, perhaps because there was no bond setup on that PSN, then the PSN logs an error and exits. The PSN will not try to start the portal on the physical interface.
NIC Teaming or bonding is a configuration option that allows you to configure two individual NICs for high availability (fault tolerance). If one of the NICs fails, the other NIC that is part of the bonded connection continues the connection. A NIC is selected for a portal based in the Portal Settings configuration. If both physical NICs and the corresponding bonded NIC are configured, when the PSN attempts to configure the portal, it first attempts to connect to the Bond interface. If that is not successful, perhaps because there was no bond setup on that PSN, then the PSN attempts to start the portal on the physical interface.
Certificate Group tag: Pick a certificate group tag that specifies the certificate to be used for the portal’s HTTPS traffic.
Display Language
Use Browser Locale: Use the language specified in the client browser's locale setting as the display language of the portal. If browser locale's language is not supported by Cisco ISE, then the Fallback Language is used as the language portal.
Fallback Language: Choose the language to use when the language cannot be obtained from the browser locale, or if the browser locale language is not supported by Cisco ISE.
Always Use: Choose the display language to use for the portal. This setting overrides the User Browser Locale option.

Idle Timeout: Enter the time in minutes that you want Cisco ISE to wait before it logs out the user if there is no activity in the portal. The valid range is from 1 to 30 minutes.

Note
In the Client Provisioning Portal, you can define the port number and the certificate so that the host allows you to download the same certificate for Client Provisioning and Posture. If the portal certificate is signed by the officials certificate authority, you will not receive any security warning. If the certificate is self-signed, you will receive one security warning for both the portals and Cisco AnyConnect Posture component.

Portal Settings for My Devices Portals
HTTPS Port: Enter a port value between 8000 to 8999; the default value is 8443 for all the default portals, except the Blacklist Portal, which is 8444. If you upgraded with port values outside this range, they are honored until you modify this window. If you modify this window, update the port setting to comply with this restriction.
If you assign ports used by a non-guest (such as My Devices) portal to a guest portal, an error message appears.
For posture assessments and remediation only, the Client Provisioning portal also uses ports 8905 and 8909. Otherwise, it uses the same ports assigned to the Guest portal.
Portals assigned to the same HTTPS port can use the same Gigabit Ethernet interface or another interface. If they use the same port and interface combination, they must use the same certificate group tag. For example:
Valid combinations include, using the Sponsor portal as an example:
Sponsor portal: Port 8443, Interface 0, Certificate tag A and My Devices portal: Port 8443, Interface 0, Certificate group A.
Sponsor portal: Port 8443, Interface 0, Certificate group A and My Devices portal: Port 8445, Interface 0, Certificate group B.
Sponsor portal: Port 8444, Interface 1, Certificate group A and Blacklist portal: Port 8444, Interface 0, Certificate group B.
Invalid combinations include:
Sponsor portal: Port 8443, Interface 0, Certificate group A and My Devices portal: 8443, Interface 0, Certificate group B.
Sponsor portal: Port 8444, Interface 0, Certificate tag A and Blacklist portal: Port 8444, Interface 0, Certificate group A.

Note
We recommend that you use interface 0 for Guest services for best performance. You can either configure only interface 0 in the Portal Settings, or you can use the CLI command ip host to map a hostname or FQDN to the IP address of interface 0.
Allowed Interfaces: Select the PSN interfaces which a PAN can use to run a portal. When a request to open a portal is made on the PAN, the PAN looks for an available allowed port on the PSN. You must configure the Ethernet interfaces using IP addresses on different subnets.
These interfaces must be available on all the PSNs, including VM-based ones, that have Policy Services turned on. This is a requirement because any of these PSNs can be used for the redirect at the start of the guest session.
The Ethernet interfaces must use IP addresses on different subnets.
The interfaces you enable here must be available on all your PSNs, including VM-based ones when Policy Services turned on. This is required because any of these PSNs can be used for a redirect at the start of the guest session.
The portal certificate Subject Name or Alternate Subject Name must resolve to the interface IP address.
Configure ip host x.x.x.x yyy.domain.com in Cisco ISE CLI to map the secondary interface IP address to the FQDN, which is used to match the certificate Subject Name or Alternate Subject Name.
If only the bonded NIC is selected, when the PSN attempts to configure the portal it first attempts to configure the Bond interface. If that is not successful, perhaps because there was no bond setup on that PSN, then the PSN logs an error and exits. The PSN will not try to start the portal on the physical interface.
NIC Teaming or bonding is a configuration option that allows you to configure two individual NICs for high availability (fault tolerance). If one of the NICs fails, the other NIC that is part of the bonded connection continues the connection. A NIC is selected for a portal based in the Portal Settings configuration. If both physical NICs and the corresponding bonded NIC are configured, when the PSN attempts to configure the portal, it first attempts to connect to the Bond interface. If that is not successful, perhaps because there was no bond setup on that PSN, then the PSN attempts to start the portal on the physical interface.
Certificate Group tag: Pick a certificate group tag that specifies the certificate to be used for the portal’s HTTPS traffic.
Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN): Enter at least one unique FQDN or hostname for the Sponsor or MyDevices portal. For example, you can enter sponsorportal.yourcompany.com,sponsor, so that when the user enters either of those into a browser, the sponsor portal displays. Separate names with commas, but do not include spaces between entries.
If you change the default FQDN, then also do the following:
Update your DNS so that the FQDN of the new URL resolves to a valid Policy Services Node (PSN) IP address. Optionally, this address could point to a load balancer virtual IP address that serves a pool of PSNs.
To avoid certificate warning messages due to name mismatches, include the FQDN of the customized URL, or a wildcard, in the subject alternative name (SAN) attribute of the local server certificate of the Cisco ISE PSN.
Authentication Method: Choose which identity source sequence or Identity Provider (IdP) to use for user authentication. The identity source sequence is a list of identity stores that are searched in sequence to verify user credentials.
Cisco ISE includes a default identity source sequence for sponsor portals, Sponsor_Portal_Sequence.
To configure IdP, choose Administration > Identity Management > External Identity Sources > SAML Id Providers.
To configure an identity source sequence, choose Administration > Identity Management > Identity Source Sequences.
Endpoint Identity Group: Choose an endpoint identity group to track guest devices. Cisco ISE provides the GuestEndpoints endpoint identity group to use as a default. You can also create more endpoint identity groups if you choose to not use the default.
Choose an endpoint identity group to track employee devices. Cisco ISE provides the RegisteredDevices endpoint identity group to use as a default. You can also create more endpoint identity groups if you choose to not use the default.
Purge Endpoints in this Identity Group when they Reach __ Days: Specify the number of days after which the device is purged from the Cisco ISE database. Purging is done on a daily basis and the purge activity is synchronized with the overall purge timing. The change is applied globally for this endpoint identity group.
If changes are made to the Endpoint Purge Policy based on other policy conditions, this setting is no longer available for use.
Idle Timeout: Enter the time in minutes that you want Cisco ISE to wait before it logs out the user if there is no activity in the portal. The valid range is from 1 to 30 minutes.
Display Language
Use Browser Locale: Use the language specified in the client browser's locale setting as the display language of the portal. If browser locale's language is not supported by Cisco ISE, then the Fallback Language is used as the language portal.
Fallback Language: Choose the language to use when the language cannot be obtained from the browser locale, or if the browser locale language is not supported by Cisco ISE.
Always Use: Choose the display language to use for the portal. This setting overrides the User Browser Locale option.

Field Name Usage Guidelines
Lost
Enable employees to indicate that their device is lost. This action updates the device status in the My Devices portal to Lost and adds the device to the Blacklist endpoint identity group.
Reinstate
This action reinstates a block listed, lost or stolen device and resets it status to its last known value. This action resets the status of a stolen device to Not Registered, since it has to undergo additional provisioning before it can connect to the network.
If you want to prevent employees reinstating devices that you have block listed, do not enable this option in the My Devices portal.
Delete
Enable employees to delete a registered device from the My Devices portal or to delete unused and add new devices, when the maximum number of registered devices is reached. This action removes the device from the list of devices displayed in the My Devices portal, but the device remains in the Cisco ISE database and continues to be listed in the Endpoints list.
To define the maximum number of personal devices that employees can register using either the BYOD or My Devices portals, choose Administration > Device Portal Management > Settings > Employee Registered Devices.
To permanently delete the device from the Cisco ISE database, choose Work Centers > Network Access > Identities > Endpoints.
Stolen
Enable employees to indicate that their device is stolen. This action updates the device status in the My Devices portal to Stolen, adds the device to the Blacklist endpoint identity group, and removes its certificate.
Device lock
For MDM enrolled devices only.
Enable employees to immediately lock their device remotely from the My Devices portal, in the event it is lost or stolen. This action prevents unauthorized use of the device.
However, the PIN cannot be set in the My Devices portal and should have already been configured by the employee on their mobile device in advance.
Unenroll
For MDM enrolled devices only.
Enable employees to choose this option if they no longer need to use their device at work. This action removes only those applications and settings installed by your company, while retaining other apps and data on the employee's mobile device.
Full wipe
For MDM enrolled devices only.
Enable employees to choose this option if they have lost their device or are replacing it with a new one. This action resets the employee's mobile device to its default factory settings, removing installed apps and data.
