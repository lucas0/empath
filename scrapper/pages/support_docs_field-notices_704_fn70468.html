Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCvr13362 TRB100BC-09 ACO firmware anomalies identified FW 5.34h vs. 5.17h
Problem Description
The CFP2 pluggables, listed in the Products Affected section, might cause Loss of Signal (LOS) if downgraded to an earlier firmware (FW) version.
Background
While testing the CFP2 module with FW Version 5.52d (5.34h), the Rx LOS monitor activates the Rx LOS Assert / Deassert alarm at signal level around 4dB off the threshold value. The issue was identified due to certain firmware anomalies.
This is fixed in FW Version 5.53 (5.35h) and presently all CFP2 modules are shipped with this FW version.
Problem Symptom
If CFP2 modules are downgraded to a version earlier than FW Version 5.53 (5.35h), an Rx LOS Assert/ Deassert error is reported as mentioned in the Background section.
Workaround/Solution
In order to ensure that this issue does not occur, customers are strongly recommended NOT to downgrade the CFP2 module FW.
All products mentioned in the Products Affected section are presently shipped with FW Version 5.53 (5.35h). This FW version is compatible with these software releases:
Platform Cisco IOS® XR Release
Network Convergence System (NCS) 1000 Series 6.5.1
Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers 7.0.1
NCS 4000 Series 6.5.25
NCS 5500 Series 7.0.1
