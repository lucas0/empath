    Cisco IOS XR Software overview
Cisco IOS® XR Routing products are powered by our industry-leading, carrier-class, 64-bit version of Cisco® IOS XR Software, designed for operational efficiency, optimized utilization, and service agility (Cisco Evolved Programmable Network). Cisco IOS XR is a carrier-class operating system that offers rich features such as Pre-boot eXecution Environment (iPXE) boot, auto provisioning, native support for third-party application hosting, machine-to-machine interface, telemetry, and flexible software package delivery.
Cisco IOS XR Flexible Consumption Model
In today’s world, customers desire a simple and flexible consumption model that gives them the capability and flexibility to purchase software capacity as and when needed. When installing high-density line cards or high-capacity fixed chassis, customers usually do not need the full capacity of the hardware from day one. Customers prefer strategic partners who can provide commercial offers permitting them to pay incrementally to expand capacity as demand for their consumer and business services rises. They want investment protection with portability of software across hardware resources to meet demand across any one of their markets. Customers also want a software license management experience that enables porting of licenses across the corporation to shift capacity to markets in demand. Pay-as-you-grow commercial offers permit service providers to pool software licenses by lowering initial investments required to incubate new services, and then invest in the network capacity as demand grows. Having this ability to add capacity as and when needed helps customers with their network and capacity planning.
Customer value proposition
Cisco designed the new Cisco IOS XR Flexible Consumption Model to specifically address customer outcomes and help customers rapidly deploy innovative new network solutions. The IOS XR Flexible Consumption Model leverages the carrier-class Cisco IOS XR Software to offer customers the ability to:
●      Reduce upfront capital. The IOS XR Flexible Consumption Model offers a built-in “pay-as-you-grow” structure that lowers initial start-up costs with the ability to add more capacity overtime as needed. Software subscription provides feature upgrades and helps defer the payment of software value for the initial purchase.
●      Utilize capital efficiently. Customers can efficiently share licenses network-wide with license pooling. This solution eliminates “stranded capacity” as a customer can use any available capacity wherever needed in the IOS XR Flexible Consumption Model network. Customers can potentially utilize their capital budgets to consume software innovations in IOS XR.
●      Simplify operations. Two software suites, Essentials Software and Advantage Software, simplify license management while still providing the carrier-class Cisco IOS XR Software feature set.
●      Protect investment. Software portability provides investment protection by enabling porting of licenses to next-generation hardware when a customer is ready. During decommissioning of hardware and transitioning to next generation hardware the customer retains the ability to not decommission the investment in the software, and instead, port it to a newer hardware provided all necessary conditions are met.

Offer structure
The Cisco IOS XR Flexible Consumption Model (FCM) is comprised of three main parts, as shown in Figure 1. The hardware is the first part in the model. The two other parts are components of the software and are defined by the: 1) perpetual software component, also known as Right To Use (RTU); and 2) the ongoing, recurring software component, also known as Software Innovation Access (SIA).
RTU perpetual software licenses involve two software suites, Essentials Software and Advantage Software. The Essential Software licenses include the IOS XR comprehensive suite of routing and management services. Advantage Software licenses are an extension of Essential Software licenses and include all features of Essentials Software licenses with additional advanced routing and management services. Some product families may have additional, optional, a-la-carte software perpetual licenses for specialized platform-specific features. The IOS XR Flexible Consumption Model thus enables the software solution at the overall network level as opposed to just a single router.
A valid and compliant SIA for the entire FCM network entitles the customer to access software feature upgrades. It also allows organizations to share RTU software licenses across the entire Flexible Consumption Model network for a given Smart Account from a common license pool. Customers can port their RTU licenses to a permissible next-generation router. SIA is available in two terms: xxx-SIA-3 (with a selectable range of 36 to 59 months) and xxx-SIA-5 (with a selectable range of 60 to 120 months), where “xxx” is the platform product identifier. For example, if you would like 48 months of Essentials SIA coverage for the Cisco Network Convergence System (NCS) 5500 Series Router, then choose the ESS-100G-SIA-3 product ID and select 48 months when ordering in CCW.
Cisco Smart Licensing
The IOS XR Flexible Consumption Model requires Cisco Smart Licensing registration and license usage reporting. A customer network under IOS XR FCM is considered compliant if the FCM-enabled devices in the customer’s network are registered to Smart Licensing and are reporting the usage.
Smart Licensing greatly simplifies the operational overhead associated with license and device experience management for customers.
A successful registration and reporting to Smart Licensing is essential to avail all the benefits of Software Innovation Access in FCM. All customers that are upgrading to IOS XR 7.4.x from 7.3.x will lose the right to software innovation and upgrades if the FCM device installation base does not register to a Smart Account and report usage.
Some additional benefits of Smart Licensing are:
●      Real-time visibility. Get a current view and immediate insights about your software licenses, entitlements, and users across the organization.
●      Centralized management. Enjoy a single location for all your Cisco software assets (including PAK licenses and Enterprise Agreements) and the ability to freely move licenses around your network.
●      Telemetry. Download reports on purchased, in-use, and available software to improve software utilization, efficiency, and budget planning.
●      Better organization. Flexibly organize licenses by department, product, geography, or other designation.
●      Speed and ease. A Smart Account is simple to use and takes only a few minutes to set up.
For a more detailed overview of Cisco Smart Licensing, go to cisco.com/go/licensingguide.
Customers can manage and organize their smart licenses using the My Cisco Entitlements (MCE) platform. The MCE platform provides a consolidated view of all assets and entitlements, including services, subscriptions, licenses, and devices in the Smart Account. For more information on how to set up your MCE account visit My Cisco Entitlements.
Software suites in IOS XR FCM
The IOS XR Flexible Consumption Model comprises two software suites, as shown in Figure 2. The Essentials software suite is for basic transport applications, while the Advantage software suite is for enhanced applications and network resiliency. The Advantage software suite includes all the features in the Essential Software suite, in addition to advanced features.
The Essentials software suite is required for active ports in the system and is a per-400-Gb and per-100-Gb capacity licenses (e.g., for the Cisco 8000 Series), per-100-Gb capacity license (e.g., for the Cisco Network Convergence System (NCS) 5500 Series, Cisco NCS 560 Series, and Cisco Aggregation Services Router (ASR) 9000 Series 3rd/4th/5th Generation Line Cards) and per-10-Gb capacity license (e.g., Cisco NCS 540 Series).
On top of the Essentials software suite license, customers may also require the Advantage software suite when one or more of the features in the Advantage software suite are used (e.g., layer 2 Advanced services, layer 3 VPN services, and Peering). Advantage software also includes Traffic Engineering, Media Access Control Security (MACsec), Service-layer Application Programing Interface (SL-API), and Broadband Networking Gateway (BNG, supported only on the Cisco ASR 9000 Series) enablement.
The a-la-carte software licenses provide specialized platform specific features (i.e., BNG on the Cisco ASR 9000 Series and Dense Wave Division Multiplexing (DWDM) on the Cisco NCS 5500 Series). The Advantage Software suite is available starting with IOS XR 7.4.1 for Cisco ASR 9000 Series third-, fourth-, and fifth-generation line cards, Cisco NCS 5500 core and aggregation platforms, and NCS 540 and NCS 560 access platforms. For the Cisco 8000 Series, the Advantage Software Suite is available starting with IOS XR 7.5.1.
