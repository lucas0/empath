Summary
On May 3, 2016, the OpenSSL Software Foundation released a security advisory that included six vulnerabilities. Of the six vulnerabilities disclosed, four of them may cause memory corruption or excessive memory usage, one could allow a padding oracle attack to decrypt traffic when the connection uses an AES CBC cipher and the server supports AES-NI, and, lastly, one is specific to a product performing an operation with Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC) encoding.

Multiple Cisco products incorporate a version of the OpenSSL package affected by one or more vulnerabilities.

This advisory will be updated as additional information becomes available.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160504-openssl
Affected Products
Cisco investigated its product line to determine which products may be affected by these vulnerabilities and the impact on each affected product. Refer to the "Vulnerable Products" and "Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" sections of this advisory for information about whether a product is affected.

The "Vulnerable Products" section includes Cisco bug IDs for each affected product. The bugs are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool and contain additional platform-specific information, including workarounds (if available) and fixed software releases.
Vulnerable Products
The following table lists Cisco products that are affected by one or more vulnerabilities described in this advisory.

Details
The names and associated Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) IDs for the vulnerabilities that were disclosed on May 3, 2016, in the OpenSSL Software Foundation security advisory are as follows.

OpenSSL Untrusted ASN.1 Structures Out-of-Bounds Write Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the ASN.1 encoder in OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability is due to the way the affected software encodes certain ASN.1 data structures. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted certificate to the targeted system. An exploit could cause the affected software to crash or allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a targeted user running an application that is using the OpenSSL library. If the user has elevated privileges, a successful exploit could result in a complete system compromise.

This vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2016-2108.

OpenSSL AES CBC Cipher Man-in-the-Middle Vulnerability

A vulnerability in OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to decrypt and access sensitive information.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient padding checks by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by conducting a padding oracle attack if the attacker is in a man-in-the-middle position between a targeted system and a Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer (TLS/SSL) or Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) server supporting Advanced Encryption Standards New Instructions (AES-NI) and the connection uses an AES Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) cipher. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to decrypt sensitive information in encrypted packets, which could be leveraged to conduct further attacks.

This vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2016-2107.

OpenSSL EVP_EncryptUpdate Function Overflow Heap Corruption Vulnerability

A vulnerability in OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on a targeted system.

The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting large amounts of specially crafted data to the EVP_EncryptUpdate() function of the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user or cause a DoS condition on a targeted system.

This vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2016-2106.

OpenSSL EVP_EncodeUpdate Function Overflow Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the EVP_EncodeUpdate() function in OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient bounds checks by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting large amounts of data to an application that uses the OpenSSL library on a targeted system. A successful exploit could trigger an overflow condition that results in heap corruption. The attacker could use the heap corruption to cause the application to crash or to execute arbitrary code in the security context of the user who is running the application. If the user is running the application with elevated privileges, the attacker could execute arbitrary code with those privileges and compromise the system completely.

This vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2016-2105.

OpenSSL d2i_CMS_bio Function Denial of Service Vulnerability

A vulnerability in OpenSSL could allow a local attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on a targeted system.

The vulnerability is due to memory exhaustion while processing certain data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted ASN.1 data to a targeted system. An exploit could cause the consumption of excessive memory resources, resulting in a DoS condition.

This vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2016-2109.

OpenSSL ASN.1 Strings X509_NAME_oneline Function Overread Vulnerability

A vulnerability in OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information on a targeted system.

The vulnerability is due to improper memory processes by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted ASN.1 string greater than 1004 bytes to the X509_NAME_oneline() function of the affected software. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause a memory overread condition and gain access to sensitive information on a targeted system.

This vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2016-2176.
Workarounds
Any workarounds, when available, will be documented in the Cisco bugs, which are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool.
Fixed Software
Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

Customers Without Service Contracts

Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

To determine the affected and fixed releases for each vulnerable product, refer to the Cisco bug identified for the product in the "Vulnerable Products" section of this advisory. Cisco bugs are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool.
Exploitation and Public Announcements
The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.
