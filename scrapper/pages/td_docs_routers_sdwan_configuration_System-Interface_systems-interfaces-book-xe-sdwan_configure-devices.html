Chapter: Create a Device Template from Feature Templates
Chapter Contents
Device templates define a device's complete operational configuration. A device template consists of a number of feature templates. Each feature template defines the configuration for a particular Cisco SD-WAN software feature. Some feature templates are mandatory, indicated with an asterisk (*), and some are optional. Each mandatory feature template, and some of the optional ones, have a factory-default template. For software features that have a factory-default template, you can use either the factory-default template (named Factory_Default_feature-name_Template) or you can create a custom feature template.

In the Device tab, click the Create Template drop-down and select From Feature Template.
From the Device Model drop-down, select the type of device for which you are creating the template. vManage NMS displays all the feature templates for that device type. The required feature templates are indicated with an asterisk (*), and the remaining templates are optional. The factory-default template for each feature is selected by default.
In the Template Name field, enter a name for the device template. This field is mandatory and can contain only uppercase and lowercase letters, the digits 0 through 9, hyphens (-), and underscores (_). It cannot contain spaces or any other characters.
In the Description field, enter a description for the device template. This field is mandatory, and it can contain any characters and spaces.
To view the factory-default configuration for a feature template, select the desired feature template and click View Template. Click Cancel to return to the Configuration Template screen.
To create a custom template for a feature, select the desired factory-default feature template and click Create Template. The template form is displayed. The top of the form contains fields for naming the template, and the bottom contains fields for defining feature parameters.
In the Template Name field, enter a name for the feature template. This field is mandatory and can contain only uppercase and lowercase letters, the digits 0 through 9, hyphens (-), and underscores (_). It cannot contain spaces or any other characters.
In the Description field, enter a description for the feature template. This field is mandatory, and it can contain any characters and spaces.
For each field, enter the desired value. You may need to click a tab or the plus sign (+) to display additional fields.
When you first open a feature template, for each parameter that has a default value, the scope is set to Default (indicated by a check mark), and the default setting or value is shown. To change the default or to enter a value, click the scope drop-down to the left of the parameter field and select one of the following:
Table 1.
Parameter Scope
Scope Description
Device Specific (indicated by a host icon)
Use a device-specific value for the parameter. For device-specific parameters, you cannot enter a value in the feature template. You enter the value when you attach a device to a device template .
When you click Device Specific, the Enter Key box opens. This box displays a key, which is a unique string that identifies the parameter in a CSV file that you create. This file is an Excel spreadsheet that contains one column for each key. The header row contains the key names (one key per column), and each row after that corresponds to a device and defines the values of the keys for that device. You upload the CSV file when you attach a device to a device template. For more information, see Use Variable Values in Configuration Templates .
To change the default key, type a new string and move the cursor out of the Enter Key box.
Examples of device-specific parameters are system IP address, hostname, GPS location, and site ID.
Global (indicated by a globe icon)
Enter a value for the parameter, and apply that value to all devices.
Examples of parameters that you might apply globally to a group of devices are DNS server, syslog server, and interface MTUs.
For some groups of parameters, you can mark the entire group as device-specific. To do this, click the Mark as Optional Row box. These parameters are then grayed out so that you cannot enter a value for them in the feature template. You enter the value or values when you attach a device to a device template.
Click Save.
Repeat Steps 7 through 13 to create a custom template for each additional software feature. For details on creating specific feature templates, see the templates listed in Available Feature Templates.

Upload WAN Edge Router Authorized Serial Number File
The WAN Edge router authorized serial number file contains the chassis and serial numbers of all valid Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices in the overlay network. You retrieve a serial number file from the Cisco Plug-and-Play (PnP) portal and upload it to the vManage NMS. Then, from the vManage NMS, you send it to the controllers in the network. This file is required to allow the Cisco SD-WAN overlay network components to validate and authenticate each other and thus to allow the overlay network to become operational.
To upload the WAN edge router authorized serial number file to the vManage NMS and then download it to all the controllers in the overlay network:
In the WAN Edge List tab, click Upload WAN Edge List.
In the Upload WAN Edge List window:
Click Choose File and select the WAN edge router authorized serial number file you received from Cisco SD-WAN.
To automatically validate the routers and send their chassis and serial numbers to the controllers, ensure that the checkbox Validate the Uploaded WAN Edge List and Send to Controllers is selected. (It is selected by default.) If you do not select this option, you must individually validate each router in Configuration â–º Certificates â–º WAN Edge List.
Click Upload.
A list of routers in the network is displayed in the router table, with details about each router.
Upload WAN Edge Router Serial Numbers from Cisco Smart Account
Chassis and serial numbers of all valid Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices in the overlay network are required to allow the Cisco SD-WAN overlay network components to validate and authenticate each other and thus to allow the overlay network to become operational.

In the WAN Edge List tab, click Sync Smart Account.
In the Sync Smart Account window:
Enter the username and password for your Smart account..
To automatically validate the routers and send their chassis and serial numbers to the controllers, ensure that the checkbox Validate the Uploaded WAN Edge List and Send to Controllers is selected. (It is selected by default.) If you do not select this option, you must individually validate each router in Configuration â–º Certificates â–º WAN Edge List.
Click Sync.
A list of routers in the network is displayed in the router table, with details about each router.
Export Device Data in CSV Format
In an overlay network, you might have multiple devices of the same type that have identical or effectively identical configurations. For example, in a network with redundant Cisco vSmart Controllers, each controller must be configured with identical policies. Another example is a network with Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices at multiple sites, where each Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device is providing identical services at each site.
Because the configurations for these devices are essentially identical, you can create one set of feature templates, which you then consolidate into one device template that you use to configure all the devices. You can create an Excel file in CSV format that lists the variables and defines each device specific variable value for each device. Then you can load the file when you attach a device template to a device.
To export data for all devices to a file in CSV format, click the Export icon. This icon, which is a downward-pointing arrow, is located to the right of the filter criteria both in the WAN Edge List and in the Controllers tab.

Parameter Scope
Scope Description
Global (indicated by a globe icon)
Enter a value for the parameter and apply that value to all devices.
Device Specific (indicated by a host icon)
Use a device-specific value for the parameter.
For device-specific parameters, you cannot enter a value in the feature template. You enter the value when you attach a Cisco SD-WAN device to a device template.
When you click Device Specific, the Enter Key box opens. This box displays a key, which is a unique string that identifies the parameter in a CSV file that you create. This file is an Excel spreadsheet that contains one column for each key. The header row contains the key names (one key per column), and each row after that corresponds to a device and defines the values of the keys for that device. You upload the CSV file when you attach a Cisco SD-WAN device to a device template.
To change the default key, type a new string and move the cursor out of the Enter Key box.
Default
When Default is selected, this field is not enabled.
