Overview of Unified Endpoint Management in Cisco ISE
If you use Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) or Mobile Device Management (MDM) servers to secure, monitor, manage, and support the endpoints that are deployed in your network, you can configure Cisco ISE to interoperate with these servers. Integrate your Cisco ISE and your endpoint management servers to access device attribute information from these servers through APIs. You can then use the device attributes to create Access Control Lists (ACLs) and authorization policies to enable network access control.
This document details the configurations that you must perform in your endpoint management servers to integrate these servers with Cisco ISE. This document currently details the required configurations for the following MDM or UEM vendors:
Cisco Meraki Systems Manager
Ivanti (previously MobileIron UEM) core and cloud UEM services
Microsoft Endpoint Manager Intune
Cisco ISE also supports the following endpoint management servers:
42Gears
Absolute
Blackberry - BES
Blackberry - Good Secure EMM
Citrix XenMobile 10.x (On-prem)
Globo
IBM MaaS360
JAMF Casper Suite
Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager
Mosyle
SAP Afaria
Sophos
SOTI MobiControl
Symantec
Tangoe
VMware Workspace ONE (previously AirWatch)

Note
Cisco ISE 3.0 or earlier releases cannot be integrated with Jamf Pro 10.42.0 or later.
After you carry out the necessary configurations in the MDM or UEM servers that you want to connect to Cisco ISE, you must join the servers to your Cisco ISE. See "Configure Mobile Device Management Servers in Cisco ISE" in the Chapter "Secure Access" in the Cisco ISE Administrator Guide for your release.
Cisco ISE MDM API Version 3 for GUID
Cisco ISE Release 3.1 introduces the capability to handle random and changing MAC addresses of endpoints. You can use Cisco ISE MDM API Version 3 to receive a unique endpoint identifier that is named GUID from the connected MDM and UEM servers. Then, Cisco ISE uses the GUID to identify an endpoint instead of its MAC address. See "Handle Random and Changing MAC Addresses With Mobile Device Management Servers" in the Chapter "Secure Access" in the Cisco ISE Administrator Guide for your release.
To receive GUID from a UEM or MDM server, the following conditions must be met:
The UEM or MDM server supports Cisco ISE MDM API Version 3.
In the UEM or MDM, the certificates for Cisco ISE usage are configured so that the Subject Alternative Name field, or the Common Name field, or both, push the GUID to Cisco ISE.
The following UEM or MDM servers currently support Cisco ISE MDM API Version 3:
Cisco Meraki Systems Manager
Ivanti (previously MobileIron UEM) core and cloud UEM services
Microsoft Endpoint Manager Intune
JAMF Casper Suite
MAC Address for VPN-Connected Endpoints
Cisco ISE uses the MAC addresses of endpoints to save and manage endpoint data in its databases, display context visibility information, and enable authorization workflows.
In case of VPN-connected endpoints, the VPN headend typically receives an endpoint’s MAC address or Unique Device Identifier (UDID), or both, from Cisco Secure Client (formerly known as Cisco AnyConnect) and then sends the information to Cisco ISE over RADIUS communication.
When you integrate Cisco ISE with an MDM server, Cisco ISE uses either the MAC address or the UDID of an endpoint to query the MDM server for the endpoint’s registration and compliance statuses, and other MDM attribute values.
If Cisco ISE queries an MDM server using an endpoint's UDID, the compliance response from the MDM server usually includes the endpoint's MAC address. Receiving an endpoint's MAC address from either the Cisco Secure Client or the MDM server is critical for Cisco ISE. Cisco ISE uses the MAC address to save and manage the endpoint data in its databases.
Configure Cisco Meraki Systems Manager
Cisco Meraki Systems Manager supports a variety of platforms, enabling the diverse device ecosystems that are commonplace today. Systems Manager offers centralized, cloud-based tools for endpoint management with far-reaching scalability for growing organizations. Integrate Cisco Meraki Systems Manager as an MDM server in Cisco ISE to leverage the endpoint information that is collected by Cisco Meraki Systems Manager for compliance checks and endpoint policy management.
For more information about Cisco Meraki Systems Manager, see the datasheet.
Cisco Meraki Systems Manager now supports MDM API version 3 and can provide Cisco ISE with a unique device identifier for connected endpoints. If you already have an active Cisco Meraki Systems Manager integration in your Cisco ISE, carry out Steps 8 to 15 for the Cisco ISE-related device profile in your Cisco Meraki Systems Manager.

Configure Ivanti (Previously MobileIron) Unified Endpoint Management Servers

Note
MobileIron has been acquired by Ivanti. MobileIron continues to offer Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) solutions such as MobileIron Core (On-Premise) and MobileIron Cloud at the time of writing this document.
Cisco ISE Release 3.1 leverages APIs through the BasicAuth framework to connect to MobileIron Core or MobileIron Cloud servers and receive GUID values from these servers. Cisco ISE then uses the GUID values instead of MAC addresses to identify endpoints, enabling reliable authentication even when MAC Address Randomization is in use.
GUID-based authentication occurs through the use of client certificates, also known as X509 or Identity Certificates. Perform the following tasks to configure the certificates sent from MobileIron Cloud or MobileIron Core servers to Cisco ISE to include GUID values.
MobileIron Core 11.3.0.0 Build 24 and later releases support the provision of GUID to Cisco ISE.
In the MobileIron Cloud or MobileIron Core administrator portal:
Create a user account and assign the required API permissions to it.
Configure a Certificate Authority.
Configure an Identity Certificate to include GUID information.
Upload root or trusted certificates, as required.
Configure a Wi-Fi profile.

Note
If you have already connected MobileIron Cloud or MobileIron Core servers to your Cisco ISE Release 3.1 and want to receive GUIDs from the connected servers, perform steps 3, 4, and 5, as required.
When you edit your existing Identity Certificate or Wi-Fi configurations, or both, MobileIron republishes the updated configurations to the connected managed devices. MobileIron does not recommend the use of self-signed certificates or local CA. This guide details the steps for self-signed certificates and a local CA only as an example, to highlight the Subject and Subject Alternative Name attribute configurations that are necessary for handling random and changing MAC addresses in Cisco ISE Release 3.1.
