Redirect DNS in a Service-Side VPN
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.8.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.8.1
This feature allows you to configure a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device to respond to Domain Name System (DNS) queries using proxy servers. This feature adds support for DNS proxy for servce-side VPN hosts and DNS redirects inside the service VPNs.

Information About Redirect DNS in a Service-Side VPN
The Redirect DNS feature enables Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices to respond to DNS queries using a specific configuration and associated host table cache that are selected based on certain characteristics of the queries. In a redirect DNS environment, multiple DNS databases can be configured on the device. The Cisco SD-WAN software can be configured to choose one of the DNS name server configurations whenever the device responds to a DNS query, by forwarding or resolving the query. Prior to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.8.1a, redirect DNS is supported only through NAT Direct Internet Access (DIA) path.
When an application-aware routing policy allows a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device to send application traffic to a service VPN and receive application traffic from a service VPN, the device performs a DNS lookup to determine the path to reach the application server. If the router does not have a connection to the internet, it sends DNS queries to an edge device that has such a connection, and that device determines how to reach a server for that application.

Note
In a network in which the device that is connected to the internet is in a geographically distant data center, the resolved DNS address points to a server that is also geographically distant from the site where the service VPN is located.
Because you can configure a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device to be an internet exit point, it is possible for any router to reach the internet directly to perform DNS lookups.
You can configure redirect DNS with either a centralized data policy or, if you want to apply SLA criteria to the data traffic, you can use application-aware routing policy.
Restrictions for Redirect DNS in a Service-Side VPN
A redirect DNS request is not accepted without NAT configuration if the request is from the same VPN with the same port from a different host.
If you configure DNS server IP address using NAT, it cannot be changed through the data policy.
DNS fragmented packets and self-generated DNS are not supported.
DNS requests from the overlay tunnel are not supported.
Redirect DNS is supported only on IPv4 traffic, and not on IPv6 traffic.
DNS requests through User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are supported. However, requests from Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) are not supported.
Use Cases for Redirect DNS in a Service-Side VPN
Unconditional Redirect DNS
In unconditional redirect DNS (scenario A), a host sends all the DNS requests to a local edge router, and the local edge router redirects the DNS request to an enterprise DNS server in the data center (which is available only using a service-side VPN) and acts as a DNS forwarder. A use case for this feature redirects statically configured IP addresses for printers to an enterprise DNS server in a data center. In this use case, all the legacy printers are statically configured with an IP address of a local router as DNS server, which acts as DNS forwarder to forward all the DNS requests from printers.
Figure 1. Unconditional Redirect DNS
Conditional Redirect DNS
In conditional redirect DNS (scenario B), a host uses a service provider (SP) or managed service provider (MSP) DNS by default. For known applications that use an SD-WAN Application Intelligence Engine (SAIE) or custom applications, for example, *.google.com, the DNS request is forwarded to the enterprise DNS server using a Cisco SD-WAN overlay network. All the other DNS requests are sent to the SP or MSP DNS server.

Note
In Cisco vManage Release 20.7.x and earlier releases, SAIE is called deep packet inspection (DPI).

Configure Redirect DNS in a Service-Side VPN Using the CLI
The following steps show the minimum policy components required to enable redirect DNS with a centralized data policy:
Create a list of overlay network sites to which the centralized control policy is to be applied:
vsmart(config)# policy
vSmart(config-policy)# lists site-list list-name
vSmart(config-lists-list-name)# site-id site-id
The list can contain as many site IDs as necessary. Include one site-id command for each site ID. For contiguous site IDs, you can specify a range of numbers separated with an en dash (–). Create additional site lists, as needed.
Create lists of applications or application families for which you want to enable redirect DNS. Refer to these lists in the match section of the data policy.
vSmart(config)# policy lists
vSmart(config-lists)# app-list list-name
vSmart(config-app-list)# app application-name | app-family family-name
Create list VPNs to which the redirect DNS policy is to be applied:
vSmart(config)# policy lists
vSmart(config-lists)# vpn-list list-name
vSmart(config-lists)# vpn vpn-id
Create a data policy instance and associate it with a list of VPNs:
vSmart(config)# policy data-policy policy-name
vSmart(config-data-policy)# vpn-list list-name
Create a series of match–action pair sequences:
vSmart(config-vpn-list)# sequence number
The match–action pairs are evaluated in order, by sequence number, starting with the lowest numbered pair and ending when the route matches the conditions in one of the pairs. Or, if no match occurs, the default action is taken (either rejecting the route or accepting it as is).
Process the DNS server resolution for the applications or application families contained in an application list. For the list-name argument, specify the list name.
vSmart(config-sequence)# match dns-app-list list-name
Configure the match–action pair sequence to process DNS requests (for outbound data traffic) or responses (for inbound data traffic):
vSmart(config-sequence)# match dns (request | response)
By default, the DNS servers configured in the VPN in which the policy is applied are used to process DNS lookups for the applications. You can direct the DNS requests to a particular DNS server. For a data policy condition that applies to outbound traffic (from the service network), configure the IP address of the DNS server:
vSmart(config-sequence)# action accept redirect-dns ip-address
For a data policy condition that applies to inbound traffic (from the tunnel), include the following action so that the DNS response can be correctly forwarded back to the service VPN:
vSmart(config-sequence)# action accept redirect-dns host
Apply the policy to one or more sites in the Cisco SD-WAN overlay network:
vSmart(config)# apply-policy site-list list-name
data-policy policy-name (all | from-service)
