Introduction
This document describes the configuration for a specific deployment Model of the Overlay Transport Virtualization (OTV) on ASR1000 Family.
Prerequistes
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:
Basic Knowledge of the ASR 1000 Platform architecture
Basic Knowledge of ASR 1000 OTV Unicast Adjacency Server Configuration
Unicast reachability between the L3 Border routers
Components Used 
The information in this document is based on the ASR 1002 with Cisco IOS® Version asr1001-universal.03.13.05.S.154-3.S5-ext.bin.
Background Information
 In OTV Appliance on a stick model, the join interface connects back through the device that has the SVIs built on. This particular model of deployment is widely used as it needs no network re-design or re-cabling when OTV is activated or de-activated for any reason. It should be further noted that OTV enabled device (ASR1000) is one hop away from the layer 3 border routers providing Datacenter connectivity.
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Theory 
Network Diagram
         Packet Walk
In OTV it is always correct to say that there are no silent hosts (End hosts are not silent or Uni-directional). If there is any unicast traffic to a destination whose mac-address is not present in the OTV table, the traffic would be considered as Unknown Unicast and is dropped.
Consider that the OTV Table has already populated & all mac-addresses are learnt.
Traffic is initiated from Site A to Site B (MAC B to MAC D)
Traffic initiated from MAC B toMAC D reaches the Edge Device (Flood and Learn Mechanism)
Edge device will look into the mac-table and forward the frames on the dynamically learnt Interface (Eth 0/2) which is the L2 Interface
Frames arrive at the OTV Device (ASR1K), and upon looking into the OTV route table finds out that the frames are for  Site B.
OTV encapsulates the frame changing the Source as IP A, its own Join-interface IP and destination as IP A, join-interface of Site B. ( [MAC B to MAC D] IP A toIP B)
OTV Decapsulation happens at Site B and the original frame is recovered
A mac-address table look up is performed for the arriving frame and it is sent across the L2 Interface back to the Edge Device
Edge Device checks the interface on which MAC D was learnt and sends the frame on it
Advantages & Working
The Main advantages of this Topology are :
No change to the existing topology
Hassle free implementation
Ease of config
The question that arises here is that how is this topology different than other in case of OTV deployment. The answer is:
Where is the Join-Interface?
As shown in the image, the Join-Interface resides behind the Edge Devices (i.e 6500 in this case). In the existing topology, put the join-interface behind the switch and build an overlay across it.
One more Question that arises here is How many interfaces do we use for the L2 and L3 connectivity from the Edge device towards ASR1000. The answer is:
There is simply no restriction to it . You can use separate interfaces for L2 and L3, or you can choose to leverage with one single interface which will act as both L2 and L3 and hence justify the name OTV ON A STICK.
A single interface can be used for L2, by building Service instances and extending the VLAN’s from the Edge device towards the OTV router’s and again a sub-interface can be built over the same interface which will be used as the Join-Interface.
The Configuration in this section focuses using of one single interface between the Edge device and the OTV router.
Configure
Note: Both the L2 & L3 links are hosted on a single Interface between Edge router & OTV router.
On The Edge Device : (Could be a Nexus or C6500)
LEFT-EDGE #sh run int gi4/3
Building configuration...
Current configuration : 109 bytes
!
interface GigabitEthernet4/3
switchport
switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q

LEFT-EDGE #sh run int vlan1

end
RIGHT-EDGE #sh run int gi2/3

end
On The OTV Router : (In this case ASR1000)

LEFT-ASR#sh run int overlay 1
interface Overlay1
no ip address
otv join-interface GigabitEthernet0/0/1.100
otv adjacency-server unicast-only
service instance 10 ethernet

end
