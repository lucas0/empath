Software Features for Cisco Catalyst IE and ESS Switches in Cisco IOS XE Gibraltar 16.12.1
The following features apply to both the IE3x00 and ESS3300 switches unless specifically mentioned.
Feature Name
Description, Documentation Link and License Level Information
VRF-lite support
VRF-lite is a feature that enables a service provider to support two or more VPNs, where IP addresses can be overlapped among the VPNs. VRF-lite uses input interfaces to distinguish routes for different VPNs and forms virtual packet-forwarding tables by associating one or more Layer 3 interfaces with each VRF. Interfaces in a VRF can be either physical, such as Ethernet ports, or logical, such as VLAN SVIs, but a Layer 3 interface cannot belong to more than one VRF at any time.
MRP Support
MRP, defined in International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard 62439-2, provides fast convergence in a ring network topology for Industrial Automation networks. MRP Media Redundancy Manager (MRM) defines its maximum recovery times for a ring in the following range: 10 ms, 30 ms, 200 ms and 500 ms.
Note 
The default maximum recovery time on the Cisco IE switch is 200 ms for a ring composed of up to 50 nodes. You can configure the switch to use the 500 ms recovery time profile as described in Configuring MRP Manage
Restriction 
Release 16.12.1 supports MRP CLI Mode only. Profinet mode is not supported in this release.
PRP Support
Parallel Redundancy Protocol (PRP) is defined in the International Standard IEC 62439-3. PRP is designed to provide hitless redundancy (zero recovery time after failures) in Ethernet networks.
Layer 2 NAT Support
One-to-one (1:1) Layer 2 NAT is a service that allows the assignment of a unique public IP address to an existing private IP address (end device), so that the end device can communicate on both the private and public subnets. This service is configured in a L2NAT enabled device and is the public “alias” of the IP address physically programmed on the end device. This is typically represented by a table in the L2NAT device.
Layer 2 NAT has two translation tables where private-to-public and public-to-private subnet translations can be defined. Layer 2 NAT is a hardware based implementation which provides the same high level of (bump-on-the-wire) performance throughout switch loading. This implementation also supports multiple VLAN’s through the L2NAT boundary for enhanced network segmentation. Ring architecture support is built into Layer 2 NAT which allows for redundancy through the L2NAT boundary.
MACsec Support
MACsec, defined in 802.1AE, is a wire-rate hop-to-hop Layer 2 encryption technology that uses out-of-band methods for encryption keying. The MACsec Key Agreement (MKA) Protocol, defined in 802.1X-2010, provides the required session keys and manages the required encryption keys used by the underlying MACsec protocol.
Routed Port Support
A routed port is a physical port that acts like a port on a router; it does not have to be connected to a router. A routed port is not associated with a particular VLAN, as is an access port. A routed port behaves like a regular router interface, except that it does not support VLAN subinterfaces. Routed ports can be configured with a Layer 3 routing protocol. A routed port is a Layer 3 interface only and does not support Layer 2 protocols, such as STP.
Configure routed ports by putting the interface into Layer 3 mode with the no switchport interface configuration command. Then assign an IP address to the port, enable routing, and assign routing protocol characteristics by using the ip routing and router protocol global configuration commands.
Note 
Entering a no switchport interface configuration command shuts down the interface and then re-enables it, which might generate messages on the device to which the interface is connected. When you put an interface that is in Layer 2 mode into Layer 3 mode, the previous configuration information related to the affected interface might be lost.
The number of routed ports that you can configure is not limited by software. However, the interrelationship between this number and the number of other features being configured might impact CPU performance because of hardware limitations. See Configuring Layer 3 Interfaces for information about what happens when hardware resource limitations are reached.
Note 
For full Layer 3 routing, you must have the IP services image installed on the switch
USB Support (IE 3x00)
All IE 3x00 systems will have two USB ports with Type-A connector on the front panel. Both ports are USB 2.0 only. These ports can be used for USB sticks and the Bluetooth dongle. They are not to be used in hazardous location. Each USB port can provide a maximum current of 500mA at 5V, with 600mA total available for both ports. USB flash drives will only support the VFAT file system. There is no maximum limit for the USB flash to work in any of the 3 platforms.
USB flash supports the data storage in IMSP. User can copy the data to/from the USB on the device. Booting a device with the image in the USB is not supported in 16.12. It is considered for the future release along with WebUI.
REP Preferred Support
One edge port in the REP segment acts as the primary edge port; the other as the secondary edge port. It is the primary edge port that always participates in VLAN load balancing in the segment. REP VLAN balancing is achieved by blocking some VLANs at a configured alternate port and all other VLANs at the primary edge port. When you configure VLAN load balancing, you can specify the alternate port.
By entering the preferred keyword to select the port that you previously configured as the preferred alternate port with the rep segment segment-id preferred interface configuration command.
Layer 3 ACL Support
You configure access lists on a Layer 3 switch to provide basic security for your network. If you do not configure ACLs, all packets passing through the switch could be allowed onto all parts of the network. You can use ACLs to control which hosts can access different parts of a network or to decide which types of traffic are forwarded or blocked at router interfaces. For example, you can allow e-mail traffic to be forwarded but not Telnet traffic. ACLs can be configured to block inbound traffic, outbound traffic, or both.
Support:
VACL not supported on SVI interface.
When VACL and PACL both are applicable for a packet then PACL takes precedence over VACL and VACL is not applied in such a case.
Max 255 aces per VACL
No explicit limit on total vlan’s defined, because tcam is not carved into components, whenever enough space in tcam isn’t available to accept the new configuration, error shall be thrown with a syslog.
Logging not supported on egress ACL.
On L3-ACL, non-ip ACL is not supported.
L4OP in ACLs is limited by the hardware to a maximum of 8 L4OP for UDP and 8 L4OP for TCP, for a total of 16 global L4OP.
Keep in mind that the "range" operator consumes 2 L4OP.
PTP over PRP Support
Precision Time Protocol (PTP) can operate over Parallel Redundancy Protocol (PRP). PRP provides high availability through redundancy for PTP.
The PRP method of achieving redundancy by parallel transmission over two independent paths (see Information About PRP) does not work for PTP as it does for other traffic. The delay experienced by a frame is not the same in the two LANs, and some frames are modified in the transparent clocks (TCs) while transiting through the LAN. A Dually Attached Node (DAN) does not receive the same PTP message from both ports even when the source is the same. Specifically:
Sync/Follow_Up messages are modified by TCs to adjust the correction field.
Boundary Clocks (BCs) present in the LAN are not PRP-aware and would generate their own Announce and Sync frames with no Redundancy Control Trailer (RCT) appended.
Follow_Up frames are generated by every 2-step clock and carry no RCT.
TCs are not PRP-aware and not obliged to forward the RCT, which is a message part that comes after the payload.
Previously, PTP traffic was allowed only on LAN-A to avoid the issues with PTP and parallel transmission described above. However, if LAN-A went down, PTP synchronization was lost. To enable PTP to leverage the benefit of redundancy offered by the underlying PRP infrastructure, PTP packets over PRP networks are handled differently than other types of traffic. The implementation of the PTP over PRP feature is based on the PTP over PRP operation detailed in IEC 62439-3:2016, Industrial communication networks - High availability automation networks - Part 3: Parallel Redundancy Protocol (PRP) and High-availability Seamless Redundancy (HSR). This approach overcomes the problems mentioned above by not appending an RCT to PTP packets and bypassing the PRP duplicate/discard logic for PTP packets.
Trustsec
Cisco TrustSec® technology helps protect critical assets from malware and bad intent by controlling access to your applications, equipment, and users. Cisco TrustSec software-defined segmentation simplifies the security controls in your network and provides consistent, automated policy across campuses, branches, and data centers whether users connect through wired, wireless, or VPN. Automation is enabled through the distribution of rich contextual information to network decision points.
Restriction 
In 16.12.1, SGT, SGACL, are supported on IE3400 models only.
An IEM3400 expansion model is required for SGT and SGACL, to expand ports beyond the base. SXP is supported on all models.
OSPF
OSPF is an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) developed by the OSPF working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). OSPF was designed expressly for IP networks and it supports IP subnetting and tagging of externally derived routing information. OSPF also allows packet authentication and uses IP multicast when sending and receiving packets.

Licensing
This section provides information about the licensing packages for features available on Cisco Catalyst IE3x00 Rugged, and ESS3300 Series Switches.
License Levels
The software features available on Cisco Catalyst ie3x00 Rugged and ESS3300 switches, fall under these base or add-on license levels.
Base Licenses
Network Essentials
Network Advantage—Includes features available with the Network Essentials license and more.
Add-On Licenses
Add-On Licenses require a Network Essentials or Network Advantage as a pre-requisite. The features available with add-on license levels provide Cisco innovations on the switch, as well as on the Cisco Digital Network Architecture Center (Cisco DNA Center).
DNA Essentials
DNA Advantage— Includes features available with the DNA Essentials license and more.
To find information about platform support and to know which license levels a feature is available with, use Cisco Feature Navigator. To access Cisco Feature Navigator, go to https://www.cisco.com/go/cfn. An account on cisco.com is not required.
Feature Licenses
Feature Licenses are bound to aspecific feature or set of features. Feature licenses can be enabled regardless of Base License (Network Advantage or Network Essential). Feature licenses are smart licenses as well and require a smart account to be activated.
MRP requires a feature license. there are 2 MRP licenses available for IE3x00.
LIC-MRP-MGR-XE= MRP Ring Manager license.
LIC-MRP-CLIENT-XE= MRP Ring Client License.
platform license feature [mrp-client | mrp-manager] 
Use "platform license feature [mrp-client | mrp-manager]" to add the license, then follow the SL or SLR process to activate the feature license.
License Types
The following license types are available:
Permanent—for a license level, and without an expiration date.
Evaluation—a license that is not registered.
License Levels - Usage Guidelines
Base licenses (Network-Advantage) are ordered and fulfilled only with a permanent license type.
Add-on licenses (DNA Advantage) are ordered and fulfilled only with a term license type.
An add-on license level is included when you choose a network license level. If you use DNA features, renew the license before term expiry, to continue using it, or deactivate the add-on license and then reload the switch to continue operating with the base license capabilities.
Evaluation licenses cannot be ordered. They are not tracked via Cisco Smart Software Manager and expire after a 90-day period. Evaluation licenses can be used only once on the switch and cannot be regenerated. Warning system messages about an evaluation license expiry are generated only 275 days after expiration and every week thereafter. An expired evaluation license cannot be reactivated after reload.

Note
Network Essentials license is the default license. It is permanent. A connection to the Smart Licensing server is not required if the IE switch will be deployed with a Network Essentials license.
Smart Licensing
Cisco Smart Licensing is a unified license management system that manages all the software licenses across Cisco products.
It enables you to purchase, deploy, manage, track and renew Cisco Software. It provides information about license ownership and consumption through a single user interface.
The solution is composed of Smart Accounts and Cisco Smart Software Manager. The former is an online account of your Cisco software assets and is required to use the latter. Cisco Smart Software Manager is where you can perform all your licensing management related tasks, such as, registering, de-registering, moving, and transferring licenses. Users can be added and given access and permissions to the smart account and specific virtual accounts.

Important
Cisco Smart Licensing is the default and the only available method to manage licenses on IE3x00 products.
Deploying Smart Licensing
The following provides a process overview of a day 0 to day N deployment directly initiated from a device. Links to the configuration guide provide detailed information to help you complete each one of the smaller tasks.
Procedure
Step 1
Begin by establishing a connection from your network to Cisco Smart Software Manager on cisco.com.
Step 2
Create and activate your Smart Account, or login if you already have one.
To create and activate Smart Account, go to Cisco Software Central → Create Smart Accounts. Only authorized users can activate the Smart Account.
Step 3
Complete the Cisco Smart Software Manager set up.
Accept the Smart Software Licensing Agreement.
Set up the required number of Virtual Accounts, users and access rights for the virtual account users.
Virtual accounts help you organize licenses by business unit, product type, IT group, and so on.
With this,
The device is now in an authorized state and ready to use.
The licenses that you have purchased are displayed in your Smart Account.
What to do next
Register and convert traditional licenses to Smart Licenses.
Using Smart Licensing on an Out-of-the-Box Device
If an out-of-the-box device has the software version factory-provisioned, all licenses on such a device remain in evaluation mode until registered in Cisco Smart Software Manager.
How Upgrading or Downgrading Software Affects Smart Licensing
Note how upgrading to a release that supports Smart Licensing or moving to a release that does not support Smart Licensing affects licenses on a device:
When you upgrade from an earlier release to one that supports Smart Licensing—all existing licenses remain in evaluation mode until registered in Cisco Smart Software Manager. After registration, they are made available in your Smart Account.
When you downgrade to a release where Smart Licensing is not supported—all smart licenses on the device are converted to traditional licenses and all smart licensing information on the device is removed.
Known Issues
This section contains information about the known issues in this release.
IGMP Snooping and Unregistered Multicast Packet Forwarding
Symptoms: Although the mrouter port is configured and multicast receivers have sent igmp-joins to listen to registered multicast streams, unknown multicast streams that ingress the switch are forwarded to all the ports. The flooding may lead to reduction in bandwidth for registered multicast traffic.
Conditions: The issue occurs when the switch receives unregistered multicast packets with a pure L2 configuration and an external IGMP snooping querier is configured on the VLAN. There should not be a membership join received on any VLAN ports.
Workaround: To stop the VLAN, execute the command switchport block multicast on that interface, as shown in the following example:
Switch#configure terminal
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
Switch(config)#interface gigabitEthernet 1/10
Switch(config-if)#switchport block ?        
  multicast  Block unknown multicast addresses
  unicast    Block unknown unicast addresses
 
Switch(config-if)#switchport block mu
Switch(config-if)#switchport block multicast
