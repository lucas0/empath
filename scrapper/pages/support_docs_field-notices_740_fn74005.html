Problem Description

Affected Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) releases may have system performance issues such as high memory utilization, high CPU utilization, high latency, and high load average.

Background

Starting with Cisco ISE Release 2.7 Patch 2, the minimum and initial size of the memory allocation for Java has decreased. This may cause a significant amount of CPU resource consumption. 

Problem Symptom

RADIUS Live Logs in the ISE application may display the following behaviors: 
Logs that indicate latency are represented by the ‚è∞icon and reference step latency as shown in the following example:
                                The RADIUS packet is already in the process.
  The issue exists if both symptoms 1 and 2 appear in Live Logs.
To access RADIUS Live Logs, choose Operations > RADIUS > Live Logs and click the üîç icon.
In addition, the following alarms may be observed in the Alarms dashlet on the main ISE dashboard: 
High Authentication Latency
High Memory Utilization
High Load Average
Profiler Queue Size Limit Reached

Workaround/Solution

Workaround
Reloading the system may temporarily alleviate the issue, but the issue may reappear within minutes after reloading.
Solution
Cisco recommends upgrading to one of the following Cisco ISE releases if system performance issues are observed:
2.7 Patch 9 or later
3.0 Patch 7 or later
3.1 Patch 5 or later
3.2 Patch 1 or later
As an alternate solution, a Hot Patch to fix the issue for all versions of software is available for download from the Cisco Software Download Center.
