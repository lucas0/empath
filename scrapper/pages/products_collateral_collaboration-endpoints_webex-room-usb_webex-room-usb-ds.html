    Cisco Webex® Room USB is a lighter version of the Webex Room Kit Mini. It is a smart videoconferencing solution for huddle spaces and is compatible with any collaboration vendor. With a simple user interface, the Cisco Room USB is controlled with a remote control device, or directly through your software client. When not in use, it makes your screens come alive with digital signage of your choice. Experience Cisco quality in your smallest spaces at an affordable price.
Cisco® Webex Room USB delivers the industry-leading collaboration experience customers have come to expect from Cisco, which is consistent whether you’re in a huddle space or a corporate boardroom. Easy deployment and management capabilities allow customers to outfit and support thousands of huddle spaces with intelligent collaboration tools typical of larger room systems—at high value—while unique analytics provide valuable insight on utilization for resource planning. Together, these features allow Cisco to remove the barriers to use and deployment and enable the new huddle work style embraced by today’s workforce. Webex Room USB is rich in functionality and experience, while priced and designed to be easily scalable.
The Webex Room USB is ideal for huddle spaces with two to five people because of its wide 120-degree field of view, which allows everyone in a huddle space to be seen (see Figure 1). It offers the flexibility to connect to laptop-based video conferencing software via USB.

Cisco Webex Room USB prominent features and differentiators
Improve the Quality of Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) Meetings
The Cisco Webex Room USB offers collaboration innovation in a box, bringing more intelligence and usability to your huddle spaces. While other vendors struggle to insert advanced features such as automatic framing, wireless guest sharing, signage and 4K content into their high-end products, Cisco is bringing these innovations to huddle spaces in a cost-effective and simple way. With the Room USB, Cisco helps customers experience smarter BYOD meetings, enabling smarter presentations, and creating smarter rooms.
These features were previously the domain of higher-end video conferencing rooms, but with Webex Room USB, they can now be brought to every room and every team. And when registered to Cisco Webex, additional cloud-based functionalities are enabled that enhance the user experience and team workflow as well as further simplify deployment. Some examples include:
●     Webex Control Hub, which offers remote management, software upgrades, and analytics.
●     Digital signage. Enable signage on your screens in Control Hub.
●     Wireless guest sharing. Get simple wireless sharing through your browser.
●     Smart rooms. Get a people count for usage metrics and resource allocation; tight integrations with screens enhance user interactions.

Never bring your laptop to a meeting again
Upgrade to Cisco Webex Room Kit Mini and leave your desktop behind. Now you can easily upgrade your Webex Room USB to a Webex Room Kit Mini. Just purchase an upgrade kit, which contains a license upgrade key and a Cisco Touch 10. When you receive your Touch 10, simply enter the license key into the unit, and your Room USB will become a full-featured Room Kit Mini. Once you do, you’ll have open access to Webex’s whole ecosystem of APIs and macros. During an upgrade, the codec is also activated so you no longer need to run meetings from your computer. Cisco Proximity technology in the Room Kit Mini means the screen will greet you when you enter the room, it will pair with your device, and will enable easier wireless sharing through your Webex Meetings or Webex Teams™ app. Guest sharing is, of course, also included.
