    Product overview
In this era of digital transformation and business resiliency, continuous innovation is critical for organizations to succeed, and experiencing downtime along the way is not an option. Users increasingly demand more features and better usability, reliability, and environmental sustainability from the applications they use.
The network plays a huge role in meeting such demands, and provisioning reliable data-center and cloud-networking services as fast as possible, when and where organizations need them, is a must. However, network infrastructure management is becoming more complex, diverse, and distributed, with multiple configuration points, monitoring tools, and vast amounts of data being generated every second (Figure 1).
Included with every Cisco Nexus® 9000 switch tiered licensing purchase,* Cisco Nexus Dashboard provides a single focal point to unite disparate network configurations and views of multiple switches, data centers, and clouds (Figure 2). Through its Insights service, network operators can now accelerate time to resolution and preserve compliance in their networks by leveraging years of Cisco knowledge hosted on Nexus Dashboard’s analytics engine.

Cisco Nexus Dashboard and services
Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights supports Cisco® Application Centric Infrastructure (Cisco ACI®) and Cisco NX-OS networks with Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC). It is a microservices-based service natively hosted on Cisco Nexus Dashboard.
The operational intelligence engine of Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights incorporates a set of advanced alerting, baselining, correlation, and forecasting algorithms to provide deep insights into the behavior of the network by utilizing telemetry data obtained from networking and compute components.
Figure 2.               
Cisco Nexus Dashboard: Operational intelligence engine
Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights accelerates troubleshooting and helps rapid root-causing and early remediation. Compliance rules keep the network state aligned with operator intent. It simplifies audits and ensures compliance while also helping infrastructure owners comply with SLA requirements for their users.
Nexus Dashboard provides a cluster of compute nodes that are horizontally scalable. The sizing and number of compute nodes required for Nexus Dashboard Insights depends on the number of sites, the number of switches in each site, and the workflows per second that the users want the application to support.

Cisco Intersight Nexus Dashboard Base
Cisco Intersight™ Nexus Dashboard Base lets you view all your data center networking inventory directly from Intersight. For more information, see Cisco Intersight Nexus Dashboard (ND) Base.
Cisco Intersight Nexus Dashboard (ND) Base offers customers basic information on data-center network assets, inventory, and status in the Intersight portal. It provides customers with a single, high-level view of your Cisco Nexus infrastructure health. The consolidated view supports consistency and compliance checks and makes it easier to prevent administrative lapses in end-of-support contracts.
These benefits and business outcomes are made possible through a prepackaged Cisco Nexus Insights Cloud Connector (described below), which comes with the Cisco data center network controllers such as Cisco APIC and Cisco DCNM/NDFC.
Cisco Nexus Insights Cloud Connector
Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights provides a license-free version of the application, called Cisco Nexus Insights Cloud Connector, which will benefit operators by collecting valuable information about the status and capabilities of Cisco data-center platforms.
The Cisco Nexus Insights Cloud Connector (Cisco NI Cloud Connector) application provides customers with the benefit of faster time to remediation with Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) functionalities along with automatic, secure collection of tech-support logs. Cisco Nexus Insights Cloud Connector will empower IT teams to provide inventory reports of license entitlement, upcoming renewals, and proactive defect notifications, along with lifecycle management support from integrated Cisco Customer Experience (CX) programs.
Cisco Nexus Insights Cloud Connector is prepackaged with Cisco data-center platforms to automatically connect and transmit product usage data to Cisco. All product-usage telemetry data is transmitted to Cisco through an encrypted channel. The categories of data collected are limited to product usage.
