Creating a secure future for everyone
As the world becomes more reliant on technology, there are more opportunities to connect—and more risks. When we all practice better security and privacy, everyone benefits.
How Cisco defines security, privacy, and trust
Security: Protection of data, systems, and networks through embedded controls that enable only authorized use.
Privacy: Fair, transparent, and accountable processing of personal information.
Trust: The result of Cisco’s efforts to build and maintain credibility with customers.
Trustworthy, transparent, and accountable
Our investments across people, processes, technology, and policies support the security, privacy and resilience of our solutions, our customers and the global ecosystem. View our principles and explore the latest news on Cisco’s trust journey.
