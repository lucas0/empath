Hardware Requirements
Spine Switch Requirements
Cisco ACI Multi-Site requires the following Cisco ACI-mode spine switches:
Cisco Nexus 9500 platform switches with -EX or -FX line cards and -E or -E2 fabric modules
Cisco Nexus 9500 platform switches with non -EX/-FX line cards or using non -E/-E2 fabric modules are not supported with Multi-Site
Cisco Nexus 9316D-GX switches
Cisco Nexus 93600CD-GX switches
Cisco Nexus 9332C and 9364C switches
Cisco Nexus 9336PQ switches for leaf-to-spine connectivity within a site only
These switches are not supported for inter-site connectivity with Multi-Site
For the list of specific switch models supported by Cisco ACI Multi-Site, see Hardware Compatibility.
Leaf Switch Requirements
Cisco ACI Multi-Site has no dependency on the fabrics' leaf switches and as such supports the same leaf switch models as the Cisco APIC. The full list of supported hardware is available in the ACI-mode Switches Hardware Support Matrix.
IPN Connectivity Across Sites
The following figure shows how spine switches supported with ACI Multi-Site are connected to the intersite network.
You can choose to mix spine switches supported by ACI Multi-Site with switches that are not supported within the same Cisco APIC fabric but only the supported switches can connect to the intersite network as shown in the following figure.
Hardware Compatibility
Spine Switches

Leaf Switches
Cisco ACI Multi-Site has no dependency on the fabrics' leaf switches and as such supports the same leaf switch models as the Cisco APIC. The full list of supported hardware is available in the ACI-mode Switches Hardware Support Matrix.
