Active Cisco.com account
Smart account administrator user role (To request access to a Smart account, refer to How to Request Access to an Existing Smart Account.)
Smart account that is enabled for SLR (To identify that your Smart account is enabled for SLR, refer to How to Identify That the Smart Account Is Enabled for SLR.)

Enabling Factory Preinstalled SLR on a Smart Account

From the Reserved License Preinstallation drop-down list, select one of the following options:
Next:
Result:
a. Enabled on All Virtual Accounts
Click Save.
If you order a product with operating system (OS) version that supports factory preinstalled SLR and assign the order to the specific Smart account with the reserved license preinstallation flag Enabled on All Virtual Accounts, then the device will be shipped with the factory preinstalled SLR. When you receive the product, the product instance is already created and the device contains the factory preinstalled SLR license.
b. Enabled on Selected Virtual Accounts
The system displays the Enable Preinstallation on Selected Virtual Accounts dialog box. From the Available Virtual Accounts list box, click the Virtual account that you want to select, and then click the right chevron button to move it to the Enable Preinstallation on list box (refer to Figure 2). Click OK. 
Step result: The system returns to the Preferences tab. Click Save.
Note: To remove the Virtual account from the Enable Preinstallation on list box, click the Virtual account that you want to remove, and then click the left chevron button.
If you order a product with OS version that supports factory preinstalled SLR and assign the order to the specific Virtual account that resides within the selected Smart account with the reserved license preinstallation flagEnabled on Selected Virtual Accounts, then the device will be shipped with the factory preinstalled SLR for that specific Virtual account. When you receive the product, the product instance is already created and the device contains the factory preinstalled SLR license.
c. Disabled (by default)
Click Save.
If you order a product with OS version that supports factory preinstalled SLR and you assign the order to a Smart account with the reserved license preinstallation flag Disabled, then the system automatically rejects the factory prinstalled licenses. The device is shipped and the licenses are provisioned to a Smart account but without a reservation.
Caution: The exception is if you order a predefined SLR factory preinstalled-only product (for example, IoT Sparrow) and you assign the product to a Smart account with the reserved license preinstallation flag Disabled, then the system bypasses the flag and applies the factory preinstalled SLR regardless.
Step result: The system displays the Add Notes dialog box.
Figure 1 - Reserved license preinstallation options.
Figure 2 - Enabling preinstallation on selected Virtual accounts.
Step 4:
In the Add Notes dialog box, in the Reserved License Preinstallation text box, provide the reason for the change in settings, and then click Save.
Step result: The system displays the notification message which confirms that your license configuration settings were saved successfully.
