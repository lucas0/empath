Introduction
This document describes SHA-256 support for Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (UCCX). SHA-1 encryption will be deprecated soon and all supported web browsers for UCCX will begin to block web pages from servers that offer certificates with the SHA-1 encryption.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:
Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (UCCX)
Certificate Management 
Announcements from Microsoft and Mozilla
SHA-1 Deprecation Update
Continuing to Phase Out SHA-1 Certificates
In these notices, the browser manufacturers have stated the browsers will show bypassable warnings for SHA-1 certificates encountered that are issued with ValidFrom dates after January 1, 2016.
In addition, the current plan of record is to block websites that use SHA-1 certificates after January 1, 2017 regardless of the ValidFrom entry in the certificate. However, with recent attacks that target SHA-1 certificates, these browsers might move up this timeline and block websites that use SHA-1 certificates after January 1, 2017 regardless of the certificate issue date.
Cisco advises customers to read the announcements in detail and stay up-to-date on further announcements from Microsoft and Mozilla on this topic.
Some versions of UCCX generate SHA-1 certificates. If you access UCCX web pages protected by SHA-1 certificates, they might generate a warning or be blocked in accordance with the dates and rules noted previously.
User Experience
When a SHA-1 certificate is detected, dependent upon the ValidFrom date and the previously listed rules, the user might see a message similar to this:
Dependent upon the decisions made, a user might or might not be able to bypass this warning.
UCCX Considerations
These tables describe SHA-1 certificate impact and mitigation strategies for each version of UCCX currently under software maintenance.

Certificate Management Instructions
There are three types of certificates that need to be verified and potentially regenerated:
Self signed certificates
Trusted root certificates
Third party signed certificates
Self-Signed Certificates
Navigate to the OS Administration page. Choose Security > Navigate to Certificate management. Click Find.
Notice the four certificate categories:
ipsec
ipsec-trust
tomcat
tomcat-trust
The certificates under the category tomcat and type Self-signed are the ones that require regeneration. In the previous image, the third certificate is the one that requires regeneration.
Complete these steps in order to regenerate certificates:
Step 1. Click the Common Name of the certificate.
Step 2. From the popup window, click Regenerate.
Step 3. Choose the encryption algorithm of SHA-256.
For UCCX version 10.6, complete these steps in order to regenerate certificates:
Step 1. Click on Generate New.
Step 2. Select Certificate Name as tomcat, Key Length as 2048 and Hash Algorithm as SHA256.
Step 3. Click Generate New.
Trusted Root Certificates
These are the certificates that are provided by the platform. SHA-1 based signatures for these certificates are not a problem because these certificates are trusted by the Transport Layer Security (TLS) clients based on their identity, rather than the signature of their hash.
Third Party Signed Certificates
Certificates signed by a third party Certificate Authority with the SHA-1 algorithm need to be reimported with SHA-256 signed certificates. All certificates in a certificate chain must be resigned with SHA-256.
Additional Notes
The latest Engineering Specials are posted on cisco.com when available. Check the corresponding product pages regularly for the Engineering Special downloads.
For any assistance on certificate regeneration or associated issues, open a Cisco TAC case.
Customers that run on UCCX versions 8.x or 9.x should plan to upgrade to the latest supported releases in order to maintain Cisco and browser support.
