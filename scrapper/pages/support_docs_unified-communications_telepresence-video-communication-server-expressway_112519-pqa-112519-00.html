Introduction
This article relates to Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server Expressway.
Q. Do I need to reboot the VCS after uploading a CPL script?
A. No. The VCS will poll for CPL script changes every 5 seconds, so regardless of how the CPL script is uploaded (e.g. via the web interface or copied using SCP), the VCS will almost immediately start using the updated CPL script.
Note that this behavior differs from the TANDBERG Gatekeeper and Border Controller. On those products, the CPL script would be implemented immediately if uploaded via the web interface, but if uploaded via SCP the system would require a reboot for the script to take effect.
