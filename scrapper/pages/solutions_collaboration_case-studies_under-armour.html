Unlocking organizational time
“Webex meeting minutes have tripled since the work-from-home orders began to 15,000 per week, but the duration of meetings is shorter now. We think people are really starting to find those efficiencies. They’re able to do a lot of their premeeting and postmeeting work right in the platform.”
