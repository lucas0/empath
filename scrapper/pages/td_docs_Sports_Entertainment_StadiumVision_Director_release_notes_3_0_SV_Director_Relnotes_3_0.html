Note All APIs in Cisco StadiumVision Director are made available by special agreement. Contact your Cisco Systems representative for more information.
Event Trigger API
Note The Event Trigger API replaces the "Emergency Alert and TV Off/On Control" support introduced in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 2.4.
Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0 supports an HTTP-based Representational State Transfer (REST) API that a software or hardware contact closure source can use to trigger one or more actions by the Cisco StadiumVision Director software. For more information about support for external input triggers, see the "External Triggers" section.
Note If you want to control external triggers from a software application, you can contact your Cisco Systems representative to obtain the Event Trigger API that is made available by special agreement. "TriggerSVD" is an example of a third-party demo application for the Event Trigger API on iOS (supporting Apple iTouch, iPhone, and iPad products) and is available as a free download from the iTunes store.
Media Planner Import API
Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0 supports a new Media Planner Import API to support import of external, third-party generated playlists. The API can be used to support automatic updates to an already imported playlist that has been placed in a script, or an external playlist can be manually imported.
The Media Planner API supports the following features:
Import Playlist Functionality
•Automatically creates playlist and populates it with existing content.
•Automatically links missing content to playlist after each missing content item is uploaded.
•Updates to playlists tied to a script that have all content items requires no human intervention.
Special User Interface Indications
•Imported playlist are easily identifiable as "external playlist."
•Indicates playlist with missing content.
•Warn user when trying to assign a missing content playlist to template.
•Warn user when starting a script with missing content playlist.
Proof of Play Addition
•Works in the same way as a manually created playlist, but with more granularity.
•Automatic insertion of PoP tag for each time slot play.
User Interface Example
The API automatically creates the playlist, which you can easily identify by an icon that tags it as an external playlist source (Figure 1).
Figure 1 External Playlists in Control Panel Content Screen
The playlist is populated with existing content in Cisco StadiumVision Director, and you are alerted to any missing content in the playlist by a red box around the external playlist icon on the Content screen. The missing content item is identified with a question mark. Once you import any missing content, it is automatically linked to the external playlist.
Current proof of play reporting is fully supported for external playlist sources and PoP tags are automatically created for specified sponsor IDs. Any missing content is not included in the PoP report.
User Control API
New functions have been introduced to the in-suite API as of Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0 to add support for Self-Service Content (SSC) feature. The new API allows querying as well as sending control information to StadiumVision Director.
The API supports the following areas:
•Album Control
•Information Retrieval
•Security
•TV Control

–Ability for the currently logged in user to the DMB application to set the preferred locale based on the installed language packs.
For more information on the DMB application, see the Cisco StadiumVision Director Dynamic Menu Board and Store Configuration Guide, Release 3.0.
External Content Integration
Beginning in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0, the Cisco StadiumVision Director solution supports integration with external data sources for content ingestion and presentation. Figure 2 shows a high-level overview of the new feature support.
Figure 2 External Content Integration High-Level Overview
The following external content sources are supported in Release 3.0:
•National Football League (NFL) Game Statistics and Information System (GSIS) Cumulative Statistics
•NFL GSIS Game Clock
•Daktronics All Sport 5000 Scoreboard Controller (basketball and hockey only)
•OES ISC9000 Intelligent Scoreboard Controller (basketball and hockey only)
Once you have established connectivity to the external data source and selected and mapped the data that you want to display in the Cisco StadiumVision Director External Content Integration interface, you can use the Widgets tool on the Control Panel to design a layout of those statistics.
Note The Widgets tool only supports layout design for the External Content Integration feature in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0.
From there, complete the following tasks to publish the content to a TV:
•Create a playlist from the Control Panel for the widget that you created.
•Create an event script to run the playlist.
•Schedule the script to display the content on a TV.
For more information on External Content Integration, see the Cisco StadiumVision Director External Content Integration Guide, Release 3.0.
External Triggers
Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0 supports an HTTP-based Representational State Transfer (REST) API that a software or hardware contact closure source can use to trigger one or more actions by the Cisco StadiumVision Director software, such as to start an event script to control display of content for a desired "moment of exclusivity" or make an emergency notification at a venue.
Building management and life safety systems as well as the broadcast control room in a stadium typically allow external integration by using dry contact closure and/or GPIO devices. It is expected that networked surveillance cameras, video routers, and other broadcast equipment already have these input/output (I/O) modules built into the hardware.
Figure 3 shows the different sources of contact closure that can be used as external input triggers to an event script on the Cisco StadiumVision Director server.
•The virtual contact closure option represents a software application that can initiate an HTTP request directly and also use the Event Trigger API for retrieval of input trigger configuration from Cisco StadiumVision Director. You can obtain a free sample third-party software application called "TriggerSVD" on the Apple iTunes site.
•The physical contact closure option represents a hardware device, such as those used for life safety or building management systems, which produce an electrical signal that requires another device to convert the signal to an IP-based HTTP request. Figure 3 Option B shows this conversion being done by a GPIO gateway to initiate the HTTP request after receiving the trigger from the physical contact closure device. The Crestron QM-RMC is an example of a third-party hardware device that accepts two-wire signals and sends commands to Cisco StadiumVision Director.
Figure 3 Input Sources of Contact Closure to Cisco StadiumVision Director
Cisco StadiumVision Director can perform certain script actions or TV controls upon receipt of an input trigger. Each input trigger can be configured to have multiple actions.
You can configure the following script actions to occur upon receipt of an input trigger:
•Start a script.
•Stop a script.
•Change to an ad-hoc state.
•Leave the current ad-hoc state.
•Go to the next sequential state.
•Go to the previous sequential state.
You can configure the following TV control actions to occur upon receipt of an input trigger:
•Turn TVs off by group, zone, or device.
•Turn TVs on by group, zone or device.
Cisco StadiumVision Director has 16 default input trigger IDs (and supports a maximum of 64) that are initially disabled and serve as placeholders for a Cisco StadiumVision Director administrator to define and enable for your system. The user interface options are defined in Extensible Markup Language (XML) code that can be accessed by an application using the Event Trigger API.
For more information about configuring external trigger support by Cisco StadiumVision Director administrators who are responsible for working with third-party developers and system integrators to establish connectivity for external input triggers, see the Configuring Cisco StadiumVision Director for External Triggers guide.
Event-Time Content Replacement
The Event-Time Content Replacement feature is introduced in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0 to allow you to perform content updates in a playlist during content presentation. Prior to Release 3.0, content distribution and presentation were dependent operations and you could not update content while a script was already running for that content.
Caution Event-Time Content Replacement should be used with care if you are using Proof of Play due to impact of Proof of Play reporting if changes are made while a script is running. The cost-benefit of replacing content versus PoP impact should be weighed. Once an updated event script has stopped running, the PoP will operate normally upon re-running of the script.
You should avoid making the following types of playlist updates when using PoP with Event-Time Content Replacement:
•Adding items to the end of a playlist—The new item will show up in the PoP raw data, but not the detailed report.
•Removing an item from a playlist—Synchronization of the PoP reporting will be mismatched.
Figure 4 shows the recommended method of performing event-time content replacement to minimize impact to PoP reporting.
Figure 4 Replacement of Existing Playlist Item
Internationalization and Localization
Note Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0 supports internationalization and localization for the Cisco DMP 4310G only and the Cisco Unified IP Phone 7975G.
Internationalization (i18n)
Internationalization (known as i18n) support refers to the software infrastructure that is designed to accommodate multiple language translations (localization) without requiring additional engineering changes to that software.
The Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0 software supports i18n for the following general areas of the solution:
•Control Panel in Cisco StadiumVision Director
•Dynamic Menu Board application
•Management Dashboard in Cisco StadiumVision Director
•IP Phone user interface
•TV user interface
Localization (L10n)
Localization (known as L10n) refers to the implementation of the specific regional language translation support within a software interface that has been designed for i18n.
Note Infrastructure for L10n has been implemented in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0 to support the future introduction of multiple locales. Certain locales are not supported in Release 3.0, such as right-to-left languages.
In the initial release of Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0 software (Release 3.0.0-247), English is the only supported (and default) language for the Cisco StadiumVision solution. Support for other language translations are introduced as they become available in Service Packs.
Service Packs for Localization
Note When a Service Pack for Cisco StadiumVision Director is installed, all languages within the SP will be automatically installed.
Service Pack 1 (Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0.0-429) includes support for the following languages (associated locales are in parentheses):
–Deutsch (de_DE)
–English (en_US). This is the default locale in all Cisco StadiumVision Director 3.0 releases.
–French (fr_FR)
–Italian (it_IT)
–Japanese (ja_JP)
–Korean (ko_KR)
–Polish (pl_PL)
–Portuguese (pt_BR)
–Russian (ru_RU)
–Simplified Chinese (zh_CN)
–Spanish (es_ES)
–Swedish (sv_SE)

Translated User Documents
Available versions of translated end-user documents for Cisco StadiumVision Director can be found at:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps11274/tsd_products_support_translated_end_user_guides_list.html
Self-Service Content
Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0 introduces support for independent users to upload images and videos using the new Self-Service Content feature.
Note The Self-Service Content feature requires additional hard drive space and initial configuration by a Cisco StadiumVision Director administrator to define categories in the system registry and add self-service content user accounts.
Figure 5 shows the differences in content creation abilities in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 2 and Release 3, where only administrator and content manager roles could manage content in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 2. In Cisco StadiumVision Release 3.0, the ability to get content into Cisco StadiumVision Director has been expanded to include users of various functional areas in a venue using an account defined for the self service content role.
Figure 5 Content Creators in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 2 and Release 3
The Cisco StadiumVision Director SSC feature provides a way for business users from a variety of functional areas at a venue to independently upload custom content directly to the Cisco StadiumVision Director server and assign it to suites and devices for later presentation.
The SSC feature provides a portal for each authorized user to upload and store content in folders called albums. This user-specific workspace is the only area of the Cisco StadiumVision Director software that an individual SSC user can access. It contains only the content uploaded by that user, and only that user can see the content. When the content is published to specific DMPs, only those areas of the venue have access to the albums.
Ways to Use SSC
The following are some of the specific ways that you can use SSC for certain business functions at your venue:
•Back-office administrator—Display logo of a particular sponsor while meeting with them.
•Coaches—Create and display workout schedules in the locker room.
•Concessions—Update static menu boards.
•Human resources—Announce an employee of the month.
•Security office—Display lost child message.
•Suite attendant—Display personal "Happy Birthday" message.
•Suite sales—Personalize suites by suite owner.
•Team store—Create and display store promotions.

Installation Notes
This section includes the following installation information:
•CIMC and BIOS Firmware Installation for Cisco StadiumVision Director Platform 2 Servers
•Important Upgrade Notes
CIMC and BIOS Firmware Installation for Cisco StadiumVision Director Platform 2 Servers
Platform 2 (SV-DIRECTOR-K9 or SV-PLATFORM2=) of the Cisco StadiumVision Director server requires installation of the Unified Computing System (UCS) Server Firmware Version 1.4(2) or later to avoid problems powering off the server hardware.
Verifying the BIOS Firmware Version
You can verify the firmware version installed on Platform 2 of the Cisco StadiumVision Director server by running a Basic System State Report from the Cisco StadiumVision Director main menu.
Note BIOS firmware version 1.4.1 is the compatible version packaged with CIMC firmware version 1.4.2.
In the OS Information section of the Basic System State Report, look for "BIOS Information" and "Version" below the "Handle 0x00005, DMI type 0, 24 bytes" line, as shown in the following example.
If your version is less than "1.4.1," then an upgrade is needed:
Handle 0x0005, DMI type 0, 24 bytes.
BIOS Information
Vendor: Cisco Systems, Inc.
Version: C200.1.1.1a.0.032920100525
Release Date: 03/29/2010
Tip If the vendor information in this section is Intel Corporation, and the version begins with "S5000," then this is not a Platform 2 server, but rather a Cisco ADE 2140 Series server. This BIOS upgrade process does not apply to the Cisco ADE 2140 Series server.
For more detailed information about verifying the BIOS firmware and instructions about how to upgrade, see the "Upgrading the CIMC and BIOS Firmware on a Cisco StadiumVision Director Platform 2 Server" module of the Cisco StadiumVision Director Software Installation and Upgrade Guide, Release 3.0.

Consider the following important changes that are implemented in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0 for upgrades to existing Cisco StadiumVision Director sites:
•Installation and Upgrade Files
•Upgrade Paths
•Upgrade Process
•Important DMP 4310G Firmware Guidelines During Upgrade
Installation and Upgrade Files
Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0 software is available in different types of files based on the installation or upgrade environment.
ISO Files
ISO files are packaged images that are available in two versions:
•An ISO full image—The full ISO file is to be installed only on brand new Cisco StadiumVision Director servers that have no prior Cisco StadiumVision Director software version installed.
•An ISO upgrade image—The upgrade ISO file is built for processing using the TUI upgrade utility.
Software Download
If you have a Cisco CCO account and a contract for software download, you can download the Cisco StadiumVision Director installation and upgrade files on the Cisco.com software download site at:
http://www.cisco.com/cisco/software/navigator.html?mdfid=283479662&i=rm
Upgrade Paths
The ISO upgrade for Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0 is supported only for servers currently installed with Release 3.0.0-333.
Note Spanish localization is not supported in Release 3.0.0-247 or Release 3.0.0-333.
Table 10 lists the supported upgrade paths for Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0:
Table 10 Supported Upgrade Paths for Release 3.0
From:
To:
Release 3.0.0-429 (SP1)
Release 3.0.0-433 (SP2)
Release 3.0.0-333
Release 3.0.0-429 (SP1)
Release 3.0.0-247
Release 3.0.0-333
Service Pack 1 for Release 2.4.0-168
Release 3.0.0-333
Service Pack 1 for Release 2.4.0-168
Release 3.0.0-247

If your system is not already running Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 2.4.0-168 Service Pack 1, perform the appropriate upgrade process(es) from your current version before you run an upgrade to Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0. For more information about upgrades for the prior Release 2.4, see the Cisco StadiumVision Director Installation and Upgrade Guide, Release 2.4.
Upgrade Process
Upgrades to the Cisco StadiumVision Director software are made available using the ISO upgrade utility available from the TUI. The ISO upload utility uses a special upgrade ISO file available from the Cisco.com software download site.
There are two upgrade environments for Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0, which have different upgrade requirements:
•Upgrading an existing server from Release 2.4.0-168 Service Pack 1 to Release 3.0.
Depending on your server environment, this requires you to upgrade DMP firmware, migrate your server environment, install additional hard drives, upgrade CIMC/BIOS, and perform the ISO upgrade.
Note Upgrading from Release 2.4 requires that you obtain two upgrade scripts from your Cisco Systems representative. For more information, see the Cisco StadiumVision Director Software Installation and Upgrade Guide, Release 3.0.
•Upgrading an existing server already running Release 3.0 to a more recent 3.0 release.
This environment generally requires that you only perform an ISO software upgrade.
For more details about upgrading the Cisco StadiumVision Director software for your environment, see the Cisco StadiumVision Director Software Installation and Upgrade Guide, Release 3.0.
Important DMP 4310G Firmware Guidelines During Upgrade
Note Beginning in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0, the Cisco DMP 4305G is no longer supported.
Caution When upgrading from Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 2.4 to Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0, an upgrade of required DMP 4310G firmware between these releases is also required.

Therefore, a transition window will occur during the upgrade where firmware Version 2.2.2 Build 2744 for Release 2.4 is not currently supported in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0, which requires firmware Version 5.3.4.
To avoid issues during upgrade, perform the upgrade in the following order:
1. Upgrade from Release 2.4 to 3.0, leaving all DMPs with firmware Version 2.2.2 Build 2744.
2. Once the Cisco StadiumVision Director upgrade is complete, existing Release 2.4 features can be expected—but not guaranteed—to work with the Release 3.0/Version 2.2.2 Build 2744 combination.
Be sure that the following guidelines are met while in transition between supported firmware versions:
–Do not attempt to use any new 3.0 features, such as SSC or External Content Integration.
–Do not use the system for any public events during the upgrade window.
–Do not use the system with a mix of DMPs with firmware Version 2.2.2/b2744 and Version 5.3.4 deployed.
3. Complete the upgrade by upgrading all DMP 4310G models to Version 5.3.4.
Note For important information about how to perform the DMP firmware upgrade, see the "Upgrading the DMP Firmware" section of the "Upgrading a Cisco StadiumVision Director Server from Release 2.4 SP1 to Release 3.0" module of the Cisco StadiumVision Director Software Installation and Upgrade Guide, Release 3.0.
VLAN Compliance Check
A VLAN compliance check for DMPs is supported in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0. After you upgrade to release 3.0, you need to go to the Management Dashboard and change the Assigned VLAN property under Global DMP Settings for both the 4310 and 4310 v5.2.3 settings according to your DMP VLAN configuration as follows:
•If all of your DMPs are located on the same VLAN (recommended)—Type the number of the VLAN and save the configuration.
•If all of your DMPs are not located on the same VLAN, or you want to bypass any VLAN compliance checking—Type "$svd_ignore" and save the configuration.
Note Beginning in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0.0-429 (SP1), the default Assigned VLAN property value is $svd_ignore.
The value in the Assigned VLAN property in the Management Dashboard settings for the DMP 4310s is checked against the value being sent by the DMP, unless you have configured $svd_ignore.
Caution DMP auto-registration support requires that the VLAN value is correctly set or "$svd_ignore" is used.
Figure 10 shows how to configure the Assigned VLAN property under the 4310 Settings for DMPs that are not located on the same VLAN using the "$svd_ignore" string.
You will also need to set this Assigned VLAN property value for the 4310 v5.x.x Settings:
Figure 10 Assigned VLAN Property Configuration for DMPs
Limitations and Restrictions
When using Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0, be aware of the following limitations and restrictions:
Caution Proof of play raw data is not part of the backup process. Only proof of play report data that has been generated to the /var/sv/pofp/data directory (indicated by the green dot icon beside the script) is backed up. Therefore, it is very important that you transfer PoP messages from the raw data directory to "data/<cookie>" directory as indicated by a green dot next to the event, before 60 days of the event, after which time PoP messages in the raw directory will be deleted.
•If you have previously accessed a different Cisco StadiumVision Director version on your computer, sometimes unexpected behavior or warnings arise, or you might access an older version of the interface. In this case, and especially after an upgrade, you must clear your browser cache.
•The initial release of Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0 implements the infrastructure only to support i18n and L10n to support the independent installation of other language packs with Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0 as they become available.
•Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0 does not support internationalization for back-end messaging or the Video Distribution Manager.
•Non-English characters are not supported as a Cisco StadiumVision Director login credential.
•Multiuser support in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0 is limited to script editing only. No other Control Panel functions for templates, zones, groups, and playlists support a multiuser environment, and these areas can be deleted by other users. However, users are notified about potential impact due to currently locked scripts and are prompted for confirmation of deletion and given an option to use instant messaging to coordinate with the script owner.
•No more than 10 users can be supported at any one time in the Management Dashboard and Control Panel areas. The system does not prevent more than 10 sessions to be opened, so you need to be careful that you do not exceed this limit.
•No more than 50 staging threads can be processing in Cisco StadiumVision Director at any one time. The default maximum is 10. The maximum is configured using the "stagingThreadNum" registry found under the Tools > Advanced > Registry section of the Management Dashboard.
Note If auto-registration is enabled and a new DMP is detected, then Cisco StadiumVision Director initiates staging and always uses 50 as the maximum value. In this case, the stagingThreadNum registry setting is ignored and remains unchanged.
•Consider the following restrictions and expected behavior when configuring playlists:
–Single video loop—You can configure a playlist to loop continuously when you have a playlist with a single video content item set for a duration of zero, with the playlist duration also set to zero.
–Single non-video loop—You can configure a playlist to loop continuously when you have a playlist with a single non-video content item by setting the item duration to -1 and either:
1) Setting the playlist duration to zero, OR
2) Setting the playlist duration to a number greater than zero.
–All playlists will loop their content (for example, once the last item plays, the playlist restarts with the first item) unless a duration of zero is configured on the first playlist item.
–To run a playlist one time, you can specify a duration of zero for the last item in the playlist, except for a 2-item playlist. If the last item has zero duration in a 2-item playlist, then the first graphic plays and then only the last graphic continuously plays.
–A 2-item playlist will not work if both items have non-zero durations, unless the last item has a duration of 99999.
–Any playlist containing more than one item does not work correctly if the duration of any item in the playlist is zero, except for the last item in the playlist.
Important Notes
This section includes other important information about the Cisco StadiumVision solution that you should know for optimal operation.
DMP Maintenance Recommendations
To avoid unexpected behavior and maintain normal operation of your devices, it is highly recommended that you perform a soft reboot of all of the DMPs in your system each week. You can reboot DMPs manually or configure a periodic task to run automatically.
Note Before you perform a reboot, be sure that there are not any active scripts running.
For more information see the "How to Configure the Reboot DMP System Task From the Management Dashboard" task note.

Symptom    When using Luxury Suite service on an IP Phone that is configured for Traditional Chinese (Taiwan) or Korean, the IP Phone reboots by itself after a period of usage.
Possible Cause    This seems to be a memory issue on the IP Phone.
Note There are no issues with Simplified Chinese (Mainland China).
Workaround   There is no workaround.
CSCub76220—In Control Panel after adding item to a large playlist the list resets to the top.
Symptom    After the item is added to the playlist the list resets and now shows the beginning of the list, instead of your insertion point for the playlist item.
Conditions   The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Launch Control Panel and go to Content screen.
2. Select a playlist with enough items such that when using split view, you have to scroll to get to bottom of the playlist.
3. While in split view, click and drag a new item into the playlist.
Workaround   Manually scroll the list to the desired insertion point.
CSCub93535—Incorrect partitioning occurs if second RAID volume built prior to full ISO installation to Release 3.0.
Symptom    When installing a full ISO image for Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0 with the additional drives inserted into the chassis and the second RAID volume already built, the operating system does not partition the drives correctly with the standard file system layout required for Self-Service Content (SSC). Cisco StadiumVision Director will function correctly, however SSC will not work (even with the additional drives being present) due to the invalid filesystem layout.
Workaround   Build the second RAID volume after a full ISO install for Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0. If you re-install a full ISO image on a server already installed with Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0 and after the additional RAID volumes have been installed, then you must reconfigure RAID to recognize all installed volumes using the LSI MegaRAID utility as described in the "Installing Additional Hard Drives in the Cisco StadiumVision Director Platform 2 Server" module of the Cisco StadiumVision Director Software Installation and Upgrade Guide, Release 3.0.

2. Select an existing album.
3. Click on the publish button several times.
Symptom    The album will quickly turn green suggesting that publishing was completed. However, if the user clicks Refresh, the album returns to pink, indicating that the album is unpublished.
Possible Cause    This seems to be caused by having multiple instances of publishing being returned by the backend, where some jobs are STAGING_WAIT, and some jobs are STAGING_RUNNING and STAGING_COMPLETE. The issue seems to be worsened when a user has made several publish requests and a publish queue has developed.
Workaround   Avoid re-publishing an album when it is currently being published.
CSCua41862—CMS content deleted are not purged until a backup is run.
Symptom    The Content Management System (CMS) content that is deleted from the SSC portal does not get purged from Cisco StadiumVision Director until a backup is run. The next backup file that is created will include all of the deleted contents (videos & image files) from the CMS, potentially creating a very large backup file depending on the frequency of the backup task. This could also potentially lead to the Cisco StadiumVision Director server running out of disk space if a backup task is not run for a very long period.
Workaround   Avoid long periods of time between backups. Having a daily scheduled backup task will avoid this issue.

Open Defects in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0.0-247
This section lists the defects that are open in Build 247 of Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0.
CSCtl53505—Session timeout error when log in.
Symptom    After logging into Cisco StadiumVision Director, you might get a "session timeout" message.
Conditions   Clustering is used for Cisco StadiumVision Director single sign-on. User login information must populate to all Cisco StadiumVision Director processes.
Workaround   The session timeout problem can be overcome with a low level configuration change. Please contact Cisco Technical Support to apply this workaround.
CSCts68143—During start of script with large number of DMPs, script is editable without warning.
Conditions   Script has to have group(s) with a large number of DMPs (test case 3000 simulated DMPs). The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. User-1 starts running Script A with content staging on from Control Panel > Control.
2. User-2 opens Script A from Control Panel > Schedule to edit.
Symptom    When a script is in the "Starting" state, another user can edit the script without triggering the "Confirm Editing Running Script" dialog box.
Workaround   Check whether a script is in "Starting" state before attempting to modify it.
CSCty55562—Refresh of the data source's list will show misleading message on UI.
Symptom    When refreshing the data source's list in the External Content tab on the Control Panel several unnecessary and misleading "This field is required" warning messages appear on the UI.

Symptom    The double-byte strings entered in the system registry do not get rendered properly in the SSC portal dropdown box, even though they are stored correctly in the registry table (which is set to UTF-8 character set).
Possible Cause    This could be due to the fact that a non-double byte language pack has not been installed and is not in use by the UI.
Workaround   There is no workaround.
CSCty58446—Album playback gets interrupted if script starts on same endpoints.
Conditions   The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Using either the IP Phone or a script, start an album (number of displays does not matter).

6. Select the TSV.txt file and all corresponding image and video files identified in the .txt file for upload.
7. Click Open.
8. If no errors are found with the TSV file, click Upload to continue with the upload process.
Symptom    After the import and content upload are complete, notice that the album that was created does not show the content items in the same order as they were specified in the TSV file.
Workaround   Manually reorder the album content after TSV upload.
CSCtz38667—Attempts to delete a large number of content items immediately after import might fail.
Conditions   The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. In Control Panel, go to Content screen and import 100 or more content items (e.g. image1.png through image100.png).
2. Leave all the items selected and right after importing (within 5 seconds) click Delete and confirm to delete all of the selected content items that you just imported.
3. Wait about 30 seconds. Notice that the content items do not appear to be deleted, and an error message is displayed.
4. Refresh the browser. Notice that some (but maybe not all) of the images are removed, depending on how many images were uploaded and how long you waited to delete them.
Symptom    The more images you upload, and the shorter the time that you wait to delete, the more images remain undeleted. If you select a playlist that uses some of the deleted images, the name of an image might be missing but there is still an image id and duration.
Workaround   Wait at least a minute after importing up to 100 images before you delete them. The larger the number of images imported, the longer amount of time you need to wait before being able to successfully delete them.
CSCtz38685 —SSC content upload never completes if TSV file maps same content twice.

8. If no errors are found with the TSV file, click Upload to continue with the upload process.
Symptom    If you map two or more albums to the same content item, the content upload will not complete, and the album creation is not completed.
Workaround   Break up the TSV into separate files so that no single TSV file refers to the same piece of content twice.
CSCtz38763—In SSC when using TSV for content upload, the progress bar does not show completion fraction properly.
Conditions   The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Create a TSV file (Unicode text encoding) with multiple content pieces identified.
2. Log into the Cisco StadiumVision Director SSC portal as an SSC user.
3. Click Upload.
4. Select the option to create a new album using a TSV mapping.
5. Click Browse.

3. Select the option to create a new album using a TSV mapping.
4. Click Browse.
Symptom    The TSV file browser filter does not show the following supported file extensions: *.mpeg, *.m2t and *.m2ts. Therefore, user cannot include files with those extensions.
Workaround   Rename the extension of the video file to ".mpg".
CSCtz39461—User is not notified if an SSC album fails to publish to a DMP.
Symptom    The SSC user is not warned when publishing of an album to a DMP fails. The user only sees the album thumbnail appearing to be stuck with the published percentage superimposed on the thumbnail. The album stays in this state and no warning is provided to the user.
Workaround   Contact the Cisco StadiumVision Director administrator to verify the status of the DMP.
CSCtz51366—PoS interval store sync fails to update if store refresh is occurring.
Conditions   The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Log into Cisco StadiumVision Director with a role that supports DMB configuration.
2. Click Dynamic Menu Boards.

4. Log off and log into Cisco StadiumVision Director as an administrator.
5. Click Control Panel.
6. Go to Setup > Luxury Suites and add a new DMP to the suite that the SSC albums are associated with.
7. Go to Setup > User Management and authorize the suite and TV for the DMP that you just added for the SSC user.
8. Log off and once again, and log into Cisco StadiumVision Director SSC portal with the SSC user account.
Symptom    The SSC albums with images reflect that they need to be published again (returned to pink state) since a new DMP was added to the set of authorized TVs for the SSC user. However, none of the video albums returned to an unpublished state (pink). Instead, they remain in published state (green).
Workaround   Inform the SSC that a new authorized TV was added to the account and that all albums must be republished.
CSCtz62446 —IP phone fails to load home screen when Control Server is restarted.
Symptom    If an SSC album is being controlled on an IP phone when the Control Server is restarted by an administrator, the home screen on the phone cannot be displayed.
Workaround   There is no workaround. After the initial exception is displayed, it will not be seen again after the control server cache is rebuilt.
CSCtz67229—In the Display Specifications Basic Info tab the Save button is disabled and certain fields cannot be saved.
Conditions   The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Log into Cisco StadiumVision Director.
2. Click Control Panel.
3. Go to Setup > Devices > Display Specifications.

CSCtz70439—In VDM when a filename has more than one period character, an invalid file extension is assigned to it.
Conditions   The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Change a valid video filename (a video that would be playable by DMP) to have at least 2 periods in it. For example: homevideo.mpeg to home.video.mpeg
2. Log into Cisco StadiumVision Director.
3. Click Video Distribution Manager.
4. Upload the renamed video file to VDM, activate it, and assign to an existing group.
5. Navigate to the Video Activation page.
Symptom    When video files use long filenames with more than one period in them, VDM creates an alias for the video filename that is parsed from the beginning of the character string up through the second period, dropping any remaining characters in the original filename that occur after the second period. For example, if a file is named "home.video.mpeg," its alias [and filename uploaded to the DMP(s)] becomes "home.video." which leaves the file without a valid video file extension.
Workaround   Only use video filenames with a single period followed by the file extension.
CSCtz71231—In Management Dashboard, DMPs will cycle between critical and normal.
Symptom    In the Management Dashboard, once a DMP is provisioned and appears in Normal state, it will sometimes change to Critical state for no apparent reason and then change back to Normal state again.
Workaround   To immediately fix the issue, run a Get Status and all DMPs without problems will show the Normal green state.
CSCtz80980—Template modification does not appear in Schedule tab until UI is reloaded.
Conditions   You have created a template with a video region and an event script is configured using the template in one of its states. The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
