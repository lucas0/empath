    The Webex® PTZ 4K Camera is a premium pan-tilt-zoom camera that provides superior video quality, powerful zoom capabilities, intelligent AI-based features, and flexibility for optimized video collaboration experiences.
Product overview
Webex PTZ 4K Camera is a premium pan-tilt-zoom camera that provides a high-quality imaging solution for video conferencing and maximum flexibility for larger conference rooms. It seamlessly supports meeting spaces where you need special camera placement, want to view objects close up, or view a wide area with pan-tilt-zoom capability.
The camera can be easily connected to your video codec over an HDMI video interface and flexibly mounted on the wall or on the ceiling of the conference or training room to provide improved visibility and an inclusive meeting experience for remote participants. It is a powerful solution for integration into larger collaboration rooms, bringing advanced pan-tilt capability and an uncompromised video collaboration experience into conference meeting rooms, boardrooms, courtrooms, and lecture theatres.
Featuring a powerful zoom capability, Webex PTZ 4K Camera provides high-quality video for close-up views and framing of distant objects, prototypes, and the presenter or speakers who are sitting on the far end. Combined with Codec Pro or Codec Plus, it features AI-powered face and upper-body detection to enable natural interactions that remote participants can follow just like in-person attendees. Wherever you need to work and meet, the PTZ 4K Camera allows presenters to move around more freely by detecting, framing, and tracking them as they stand to present, and as they naturally move around in front of the room, as if they were on stage.
