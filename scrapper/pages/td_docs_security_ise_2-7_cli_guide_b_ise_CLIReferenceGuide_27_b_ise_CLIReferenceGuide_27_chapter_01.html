Monitoring Database Settings
Before You begin
You must reset the monitoring database only when the Cisco ISE server is not in the deployment.

Note
We recommend to reset primary and secondary Monitoring node databases at the same time to prevent discrepancy in log files.
To configure Monitoring database related tasks, use the following options in the application configure ise command:
To reset the monitoring session database, use the option 1.

Note
The reset option will cause ISE services to be temporarily unavailable until it restarts.
To rebuild unusable indexes in the monitoring database, use the option 2.
To purge monitoring operational data, use the option 3.
The purge option is used to clean up the data and will prompt to ask the number of days to be retained.
To reset the monitoring database, use the option 4.
The reset option is used to reset the database to the factory default, so that all the data is be permanently deleted. You can reset the database if the files are consuming too much file system space.

Note
The reset option will cause ISE services to be temporarily unavailable until it restarts.
To refresh the monitoring database statistics, use the option 5.
Example
To reset the monitoring session database, use the option 1.

Live Statistics of Profiling Events
To display live statistics from the profiling events by probe and type, use the Display Profiler Statistics option in the application configure command. This data is collected only from the Policy Service nodes and you will not see this data in Monitoring nodes.
It leverages existing JMX counters that previously required the root patch or external JConsole to retrieve, and so there is no need to use the root patch to capture this data.

Key Performance Metrics Statistical Data
To obtain key performance metrics (KPM), use the Generate Daily KPM Stats or Generate KPM Stats for last 8 Weeks option in the application configure command. This data is collected from the Monitoring nodes. The output of this command provides statistical information about the endpoints that connect to your deployment. You can choose to generate a report for KPM statistics daily or for the last 8 weeks. The report is saved to the local disk.
If you have reset the Monitoring database (option 4) before generating the KPM statistics, options 12 and 13 will not return any data because the Monitoring database is reset.

Counter Attribute Collection
ISE Counters collect threshold values for various attributes. The values for these different attributes are collected at different intervals (one at five minute interval and another greater than five minutes) and the data is presented in the ISE Counters report.
Cisco ISE, by default, collects the values for these attributes. You can choose to disable this data collection from the Cisco ISE CLI using the application configure ise command. Choose option 14 to enable or disable counter attribute collection.
Example
To disable counter attribute collection, use option 14.

Note
tcp reuse accepts values - 0 (disable), 1 (enable globally) and 2 (enable for loopback traffic only). tcp reuse is disabled by default. Enable reuse of TIME-WAIT sockets for new connections when it is safe from protocol viewpoint.
tcp recycle is disabled by default. Enabling tcp recycle enables the fast recycling of TIME-WAIT sockets.
It is recommended to use tcp reuse over tcp recycle. It is also recommended to alter these TCP parameters for improved T+ handling.
tcp fin_timeout is set to 60 seconds by default. The valid range for tcp fin_timeout is from 0 to 180 seconds. You can set this attribute to a lower value to enhance the TACACS+ performance. To change this to an optimal value, from the root shell of Cisco ISE, execute netstat -nat | awk '{print $6}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
application remove

Note
You are not allowed to run the application remove command from the command-line interface (CLI) to remove Cisco ISE unless you are explicitly instructed to do so for an upgrade.
To remove a specific application other than Cisco ISE, use the application remove command in EXEC mode.
application [ remove {application-name}]
When you do not want to remove any other application other than Cisco ISE, use the no form of this command.
no application [ remove {application-name}]
Syntax Description
remove
Removes or uninstalls an application.
application-name
Application name. Supports up to 255 alphanumeric characters.
Removes or uninstalls an application.
Command Default
No default behavior or values.
Command Modes
EXEC
Command History
Release
Modification
2.0.0.306
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
Removes or uninstalls an application.
Example
ise/admin# application remove ise
Continue with application removal? [y/n] y
Application successfully uninstalled
ise/admin#
application reset-config
To reset the Cisco ISE application configuration to factory defaults or retain the existing factory settings, use the application reset-config command in EXEC mode. In addition to self-signed certificates, you can also reset server certificates or retain the existing server certificates.
application [ reset-config {application-name}]
Syntax Description
reset-config
Resets the Cisco ISE application configuration and clears the Cisco ISE database.
application-name
Name of the application configuration you want to reset. Supports up to 255 alphanumeric characters.
Command Default
No default behavior or values.
Command Modes
EXEC
Command History
Release
Modification
2.0.0.306
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
You can use the application reset-config command to reset the Cisco ISE configuration and clear the Cisco ISE database without reimaging the Cisco ISE appliance or VMware. The reset requires you to enter new Cisco ISE database administrator and user passwords.

Note
Although the application reset-config command resets the Cisco ISE configuration to factory defaults, the operating system (Cisco ADE-OS) configuration still remains intact. The Cisco ADE-OS configuration includes items such as the network settings, CLI password policy, and backup history.
When you reset the Cisco ISE application configuration from the CLI, it performs a leave operation disconnecting the ISE node from the Active Directory domain if it is already joined. However, the Cisco ISE node account is not removed from the Active Directory domain. We recommend that you perform a leave operation from the Cisco ISE Admin portal with the Active Directory credentials. The leave operation removes the node account from the Active Directory domain.
Example
If a user selects the No option, the command deletes server certificates and regenerates only self-signed certificates. If the user selects the Yes option, the command retains existing server certificates by exporting them to a location. The server certificates are then imported from this location.

application reset-passwd
To reset the Admin portal login password for a specified user account (usually an existing administrator account) in Cisco ISE after the administrator account has been disabled due to incorrect password entries, use the application reset-passwd command in EXEC mode.
application [ reset-passwd {application-name} {administrator-ID} ]
Syntax Description
reset-passwd
Resets the administrator account password.
application-name
Application name. Supports up to 255 alphanumeric characters.
administrator-ID
Name of a disabled administrator account for which you want to reset the password.
Command Default

If you enter an incorrect password for an administrator user ID more than the specified number of times, then the Admin portal “locks you out” of the system. Cisco ISE suspends the credentials for it. administrator user ID until you have an opportunity to reset the password associated with it. You can reset the administrator password only in the Administration ISE node CLI.
UTF-8 admin users can change passwords only through the Cisco ISE Admin portal.
Example
ise/admin# application reset-passwd ise admin
Enter new password: ******
Confirm new password: ******
Password reset successfully.
ise/admin#
application start
To enable a specific application, use the application start command in EXEC mode. To disable starting an application, use the no form of this command.
application [ start {application-name [safe]}]
no application [ start {application-name [safe]}]
Syntax Description
start

application-name
Name of the predefined application that you want to enable. Supports up to 255 alphanumeric characters.
safe
Starts an application in safe mode.
Command Default
No default behavior or values.
Command Modes
EXEC
Command History
Release
Modification
2.0.0.306
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
Enables an application.
You cannot use this command to start Cisco ISE. If you try to, you will be prompted that Cisco ISE is already running.
You can use the application start ise safe command to start Cisco ISE in a safe mode that allows you to disable access control temporarily to the Admin portal and then restart the application after making necessary changes.
The safe option provides a means of recovery in the event that you as an administrator inadvertently lock out all users from accessing the Cisco ISE Admin portal. This event can happen if you configure an incorrect "IP Access" list in the Administration > Admin Access > Settings > Access page. The 'safe' option also bypasses certificate-based authentication and reverts to the default username and password authentication for logging into the Cisco ISE Admin portal.

Starting Cisco ISE Application in Safe Mode
The purpose of the 'safe' option is to bypass access restrictions that may have been caused inadvertently. When the safe mode is used to start Cisco ISE services, the following behavior is observed:
IP access restriction is temporarily disabled to allow administrators logging into correct IP access restrictions if they inadvertently lock themselves.
On FIPS enabled hosts, if the 'safe' option is passed on application startup, the FIPS integrity check is temporarily disabled. Normally, if FIPS integrity check fails, Cisco ISE services are not started. Users can bypass the FIPS integrity check with the 'safe' option on application start.
On FIPS enabled hosts, if the 'safe' option is passed on application startup, the hardware random number generator integrity check is disabled.
Cisco ISE initiates outbound SSH or SFTP connections in FIPS mode even if FIPS mode is not enabled on ISE. Ensure that the remote SSH or SFTP servers that communicate with ISE allow FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic algorithms.
Cisco ISE uses embedded FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules. For details of the FIPS compliance claims, see the FIPS Compliance Letter.
If certificate-based authentication is used, the 'safe' option on application start will temporarily use username and password based authentication.

Note
These changes are temporary and only relevant for that instance of the Cisco ISE application. If the Cisco ISE services are restarted again without the 'safe' option, all of the default functionality is restored.

Use the cleanup option, if you want to try another upgrade bundle in case of a failure or use a different version.
Use the prepare option to download and extract an upgrade bundle locally.
Use the proceed option to upgrade Cisco ISE using the upgrade bundle you extracted with the prepare option. You can use this option after preparing an upgrade bundle instead of using the application upgrade command directly.
If upgrade is successful, this option removes the upgrade bundle.
If upgrade fails for any reason, this option retains the upgrade bundle.
If you issue the application upgrade command when another application upgrade operation is in progress, you will see the following warning message:
An existing application install, remove, or upgrade is in progress. Try again shortly.

Caution
Do not issue the backup or restore commands when an upgrade is in progress. This action might cause the database to be corrupted.

Note
Before attempting to use the application upgrade command, you must read the upgrade instructions in the release notes supplied with the newer release. The release notes contain important updated instructions and they must be followed.

Usage Guidelines
You can encrypt and decrypt backups now by using user-defined encryption keys when you perform a backup of Cisco ISE and Cisco ADE OS data in a repository with an encrypted (hashed) or unencrypted plaintext password with ise-config . To perform a backup of only the Cisco ISE application data without the Cisco ADE OS data, use the ise-operational command.
You can back up Cisco ISE operational data only from the primary or secondary Monitoring nodes.

Important
When performing a backup and restore, the restore overwrites the list of trusted certificates on the target system with the list of certificates from the source system. It is critically important to note that backup and restore functions do not include private keys associated with the Internal Certificate Authority (CA) certificates.
If you are performing a backup and restore from one system to another, you will have to choose from one of these options to avoid errors:
Option 1:
Export the CA certificates from the source ISE node through the CLI and import them in to the target system through the CLI.
Pros:Any certificates issued to endpoints from the source system will continue to be trusted. Any new certificates issued by the target system will be signed by the same keys.
Cons:Any certificates that have been issued by the target system prior to the restore function will not be trusted and will need to be re-issued.
Option 2:
After the restore process, generate all new certificates for the internal CA.
Pros:This option is the recommended and clean method, where neither the original source certificates or the original target certificates will be used. Certificates issued by the original source system will continue to be trusted.
Cons:Any certificates that have been issued by the target system prior to the restore function will not be trusted and will need to be re-issued.

Usage Guidelines

Caution
Changing the system time on a Cisco ISE appliance causes the Cisco ISE application to be unusable.
Sets the system clock. You must restart the Cisco ISE server after you reset the clock for the change to take effect. Changing system time impacts different Cisco ISE nodes types of your deployment.
To recover from the impact, use the following steps:
Standalone or Primary ISE Node

Note
Changing the system time after installation is not supported on a standalone or primary ISE node.
If you inadvertently change the system time, do the following:
Revert to the original system time (the time before it was changed).
Run the application reset-config ise command from the CLI of that node.
Restore from the last known good backup before the time change on that node.
Secondary ISE Node

Note
Changing the system time on a secondary node renders it unusable in your deployment.
To synchronize the system time of the secondary node with the primary node, do the following:
Deregister the secondary ISE node.
Correct the system time to be in sync with the primary ISE node.
Run the application reset-config ise command from the CLI of the primary ISE node.
Reregister the ISE node as a secondary ISE node to the primary ISE node.

Note
To ensure that you have the correct system time set at the time of installation, the setup wizard requires you to specify an Network Time Protocol (NTP) server and tries to sync with it. You must ensure that the NTP server configured during setup is always reachable so that the system time is always kept accurate, especially in rare situations where the BIOS time can get corrupted because of power failure or CMOS battery failure. This, in turn, can corrupt the Cisco ADE-OS system time during a reboot. If you do not configure an NTP server during setup, then you have to ensure that the system BIOS time is set relative to the Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) time zone, as described in the Cisco Identity Services Engine Hardware Installation Guide.
Example
ise/admin# clock set August 30 18:07:20 2013
ise/admin# show clock
Fri Aug 30 18:07:26 UTC 2013

Usage Guidelines
The copy command in Cisco ISE copies a running or start up configuration and log files from the system to another location.
The fundamental function of the copy command allows you to copy a file (such as a system image or configuration file) from one location to another location. The source and destination for the file specified uses the Cisco ISE file system, through which you can specify any supported local or remote file location. The file system being used (a local memory source or a remote system) dictates the syntax used in the command.
You can enter all necessary source and destination information and the username and password to use; or, you can enter the copy command and have the server prompt you for any missing information.
The entire copying process might take several minutes and differs from protocol to protocol and from network to network.
Use the filename relative to the directory for file transfers.
Possible errors are standard File Transfer protocol (FTP) error messages.

Running Configuration
Startup configuration
Copying Log files
Running Configuration
The Cisco ISE active configuration stores itself in the Cisco ISE RAM. Every configuration command you enter resides in the running configuration. If you reboot a Cisco ISE server, you lose the running configuration. If you make changes that you want to save, you must copy the running configuration to a safe location, such as a network server, or save it as the Cisco ISE server startup configuration.
If you do not save the running configuration, you will lose all your configuration changes during the next reboot of the Cisco ISE server. When you are satisfied that the current configuration is correct, copy your configuration to the startup configuration with the copy run start command.

Note
Aliases reduce the amount of typing that you need to do. For example, type copy run and press the Tab key, type start and press the Tab key, which is the abbreviated form of the copy running-config startup-config command).
To replace the startup configuration with the running configuration, use the following command:
copy run start
To copy the running configuration to the startup configuration, use the following command:
copy running-config startup-config
To merge the startup configuration on top of the running configuration, use the following command:
copy start run
Example 1
ise/admin# copy run start
Generating configuration...
ise/admin#
Example 2
ise/admin# copy running-config startup-config
Generating configuration...
ise/admin#
Copying Running Configuration to a Remote Location
Copying Running Configuration from a Remote Location
Copying Running Configuration to a Remote Location
To copy the running configuration to a remote system, use the following command:
copy running-config [protocol://hostname/location]
Copying Running Configuration from a Remote Location
To copy and merge a remote file to the running configuration, use the following command:
copy [protocol://hostname/location] running-config —Copies and merges a remote file to the running configuration.
Startup configuration
You cannot edit a startup configuration directly. All commands that you enter store themselves in the running configuration, which you can copy into the startup configuration.
In other words, when you boot a Cisco ISE server, the startup configuration becomes the initial running configuration. As you modify the configuration, the two diverge: the startup configuration remains the same; the running configuration reflects the changes that you have made. If you want to make your changes permanent, you must copy the running configuration to the startup configuration.
To copy the startup configuration to the running configuration, use the following command:
copy startup-config running-config
Example 1
ise/admin# copy start run
ise/admin#
Example 2
ise/admin# copy startup-config running-config
ise/admin#
Copying Startup Configuration to a Remote Location
Copying Startup Configuration from a Remote Location
Copying Startup Configuration to a Remote Location
To copy the startup configuration to a remote system, use the following command:

To copy but does not merge a remote file to the startup configuration, use the following command:
copy [protocol://hostname/location] startup-config —Copies but does not merge a remote file to the startup configuration
Copying Log files
Use the following copy command to copy system log files from the Cisco ISE system to another location:
copy logs [protocol://hostname/location]
Example 1
To copy log files to the local disk, use the following command:
ise/admin# copy logs disk:/
 Collecting logs...
ise/admin#
Example 2
To copy log files to another location, use the following command:
ise/admin# copy disk://mybackup-100805-1910.tar.gz ftp://myftpserver/mydir
Username:
Password:
ise/admin#
Example 3
Cisco ISE moves the core files and heap dumps from the /var/tmp directory to the disk:/corefiles directory on an hourly basis. You can copy these logs from the local disk to a remote repository using the copy command. The core files and heap dumps contain critical information that would help identify the cause of a crash. These logs are created when the application crashes. You can use the dir command to view the core files in the local disk.
ise/admin# copy disk:/corefiles ftp://192.0.2.2/
Username: ftp

Usage Guidelines
The Cisco ADE OS supports public key authentication with out the password for SSH access to administrators and user identities.
Use the crypto key generate rsa command to generate a new public/private key pair with a 2048-bit length for the current user. The key attributes are fixed, and supports RSA key types. If the key pair already exists, you will be prompted to permit an over-write before continuing with a passphrase. If you provide the passphrase, you will be prompted for the passphrase whenever you access the public/private key. If the passphrase is empty, no subsequent prompts for the passphrase occurs.
Use the crypto ntp_import_autokey command to import the public key generated from the NTP server.

The help command provides a brief description of the context-sensitive help system.
To list all commands available for a particular command mode, enter a question mark (?) at the system prompt.
To obtain a list of commands that begin with a particular character string, enter the abbreviated command entry immediately followed by ?. This form of help is called word help because it lists only the keywords or arguments that begin with the abbreviation that you entered.
To list the keywords and arguments associated with a command, enter ? in place of a keyword or argument on the command line. This form of help is called command syntax help, because it lists the keywords or arguments that apply based on the command, keywords, and arguments that you enter.
Example
ise/admin# help
Help may be requested at any point in a command by entering
a question mark '?'. If nothing matches, the help list will
be empty and you must backup until entering a '?' shows the
available options.
Two styles of help are provided:
1. Full help is available when you are ready to enter a
   command argument (e.g. 'show?') and describes each possible
   argument.
2. Partial help is provided when an abbreviated argument is entered
   and you want to know what arguments match the input
   (e.g. 'show pr?'.)

Command Default
No default behavior or values.
Command Modes
EXEC
Command History
Release
Modification
2.0.0.306
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
The ping6 command sends an echo request packet to an address, and then waits for a reply. The ping output can help you evaluate path-to-host reliability, delays over the path, and whether or not you can reach a host.
The ping6 command is similar to the existing ping command. The ping6 command does not support the IPv4 packet fragmentation (df , as described in the ping command) options, but it allows an optional specification of an interface. The interface option is primarily useful for pinning with link-local addresses that are interface-specific addresses. The packetsize and pingcount options work the same way as they do with the ping command.
Example 1
ise/admin# ping6 3ffe:302:11:2:20c:29ff:feaf:da05

reload
This command has no keywords and arguments. To reboot the Cisco ISE operating system, use the reload command in EXEC mode.
reload
Command Default
No default behavior or values.
Command Modes
EXEC
Command History
Release
Modification
2.0.0.306
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
The reload command reboots the system. Use the reload command after you enter configuration information into a file and save the running-configuration to the persistent startup-configuration on the CLI. Save any settings in the Cisco ISE administration portal session.
Before you issue the reload command, ensure that Cisco ISE is not performing any backup, restore, installation, upgrade, or remove operation. First, run the application stop ise command to stop Cisco ISE processes. Then, run the reload command.
If Cisco ISE performs any of these operations and you issue the reload command, you get one of the following warning messages:
WARNING: A backup or restore is currently in progress! Continue with reload?
WARNING: An install/upgrade/remove is currently in progress! Continue with reload?
If you get any of these warnings, enter Yes to continue with the reload operation, or No to cancel it.
If no processes are running when you use the reload command or you enter Yes in response to the warning message displayed, you must respond to the following question:
Do you want to save the current configuration?
If you enter Yes to save the existing Cisco ISE configuration, the following message is displayed:
Saved the running configuration to startup successfully
If automatic failover is enabled in your deployment, you receive the following warning message:
PAN Auto Failover feature is enabled, therefore
this operation will trigger a failover if ISE services are not
restarted within the fail-over window. Do you want to continue (y/n)?
Type 'y' if you want to continue or 'n' if you want to cancel.
Example 1
ise/admin# reload
Do you want to save the current configuration? (yes/no) [yes]? yes
Generating configuration...
Saved the running configuration to startup successfully
Continue with reboot? [y/n] y
Broadcast message from root (pts/0) (Fri Aug 7 13:26:46 2010):

Connection to ise closed.
reset-config
To reset the ADE-OS network configurations such as ip address/mask/gateway, hostname, domain name, DNS server, and NTP server using the reset-config command in EXEC mode. These parameters are essentially the same parameters as that is prompted during setup. The administrator will not be prompted for admin password from this CLI. This command will also not reset the current ISE configuration or operations data as these tasks are achieved by using the application reset-config command.
reset-config
Command Default
No default behavior or values.
Command Modes
EXEC
Command History
Release
Modification
2.2.0.470
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
All services will be restarted upon completion.

Note
Updating the hostname will cause any certificate using the old hostname to become invalid. A new self-signed certificate using the new hostname will be generated now for use with HTTPS/EAP. If CA-signed certificates are used on this node, import the new ones with the correct hostname. In addition, if this node is part of an AD domain, delete any AD memberships before proceeding.
restore
To restore a previous backup of the system, use the restore command in EXEC mode. A restore operation restores data related to the Cisco ISE and the Cisco ADE OS.
Use the following command to restore data related to the Cisco ISE application and Cisco ADE OS:
restore [{filename} repository {repository-name} encryption-key hash | plain {encryption-key-name}]
restore [{filename} repository {repository-name} encryption-key hash | plain {encryption-key-name} include-adeos]
Syntax Description
filename
Name of the backed-up file that resides in the repository. Supports up to 120 alphanumeric characters.
Note
  You must add the .tar.gpg extension after the filename (for example, myfile.tar.gpg).
repository
The repository command.
repository-name
Name of the repository from which you want to restore the backup. Supports up to 120 characters.
encryption-key
(Optional). Specifies user-defined encryption key to restore backup.
hash
Hashed encryption key for restoring backup. Specifies an encrypted (hashed) encryption key that follows. Supports up to 40 characters.
plain
Plaintext encryption key for restoring backup. Specifies an unencrypted plaintext encryption key that follows. Supports up to 15 characters.
encryption-key-name
Specifies encryption key in hash | plain format.
include-adeos
Restores back up and reboots Cisco ISE, if ADE-OS configuration data is present in the backup
If you have the Primary Administration Node (PAN) auto-failover configuration enabled in your deployment, disable this configuration before you restore a backup. You can enable the PAN auto-failover configuration after the restore is complete.
Command Default
No default behavior or values.
Command Modes
EXEC
Command History
Release
Modification
2.0.0.306
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
When you use restore commands in Cisco ISE, the Cisco ISE server restarts automatically.
The encryption key is optional while restoring data. To support restoring earlier backups where you have not provided encryption keys, you can use the restore command without the encryption key.
If you have the PAN auto-failover configuration enabled in your deployment, the following message appears:
PAN Auto Failover is enabled, this operation is 
 not allowed! Please disable PAN Auto-failover first.

Note
Restoring from Cisco ISE, Release 1.0 and Cisco ISE, Release 1.0 MR backups are not supported in Cisco ISE, Release 1.2.

Note
Cisco ISE, Release 1.4 supports restore from backups obtained from Release 1.2 and later.

2.0.0.306
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
The ssh command enables a system to make a secure, encrypted connection to another remote system or server. With authentication and encryption, the SSH client allows for secure communication over an insecure network.

Note
Cisco ISE initiates outbound SSH or SFTP connections in FIPS mode even if FIPS mode is not enabled on ISE. Ensure that the remote SSH or SFTP servers that communicate with ISE allow FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic algorithms.
Cisco ISE uses embedded FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules. For details of the FIPS compliance claims, see the FIPS Compliance Letter.
Example 1
ise/admin# ssh 172.79.21.96 admin port 22 version 2
ssh: connect to host 172.79.21.96 port 22: No route to host

Command Default
Disabled.
Command Modes
EXEC
Command History
Release
Modification
2.0.0.306
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
If you see bad UDP cksum warnings in the tech dumptcp output, it may not be a cause for concern. The tech dumptcp command examines outgoing packets before they exit through the Ethernet microprocessor. Most modern Ethernet chips calculate checksums on outgoing packets, and so the operating system software stack does not. Hence, it is normal to see outgoing packets declared as bad UDP cksum.
Example 1
ise/admin# tech dumptcp 0 count 2
