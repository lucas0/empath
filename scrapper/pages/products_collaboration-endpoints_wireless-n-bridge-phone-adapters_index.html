IP Phones Go Wireless
Forget the need for network cables. Now you can place your Cisco SPA300 Series or SPA500 Series IP phones virtually anywhere within your wireless office network. The Cisco Wireless-N Bridge for Phone Adapters, also known as Cisco SPA Bridge, converts your IP phones into wireless devices, freeing you from the need for a nearby Ethernet wired connection.
The Cisco SPA Bridge enables high- quality wireless voice connections without a dedicated Ethernet cable to the phone. The built-in setup wizard and integrated Wi-Fi Protected Setup makes configuring the bridge easy.
The Cisco Wireless-N Bridge for Phone Adapters feature:
The ability to place your IP phone within your wireless network coverage without worrying about proximity to data lines
A wireless connection protected by WEP, WPA, or WPA2 encryption
