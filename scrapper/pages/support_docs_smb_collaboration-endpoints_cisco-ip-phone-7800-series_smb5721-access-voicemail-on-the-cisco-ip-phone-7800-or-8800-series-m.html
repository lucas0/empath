Check this article out if you still need to set up your voicemail.
Phones with Multiplatform Firmware
MPP phones require either service from an Internet Telephony Service Provider (ITSP) or an IP Private Branch Exchange (PBX) call control server. WebEx Calling, Ring Central, and Verizon are examples of an ITSP. Some examples of IP PBX services that work with Cisco MPP phones include, Asterisk, Centile, and Metaswitch platforms.
These ITSP and IP PBX call controllers are a separate system in which the phone and the call controller communicate with each other to provide services such as call park and voicemail. Since the MPP phones do not use a specific call controller, access and procedures vary.
Notifications that you have Voicemail
The following indicators on the phone signal the user that a new voicemail message can be retrieved.
The Message Waiting Indicator on the handset is solid red.
The number of missed calls and voicemail messages is displayed on the screen of the phone. In case there are more than 99 new messages, a plus (+) sign is displayed.
You will hear a stutter tone played from your handset, headset, or speakerphone when you use a phone line. This stutter tone is line-specific. You only hear it when you use a line that has voice messages.
Access Voice Mailbox: General Instructions
Each call controller can follow different procedures, so we can't tell you exactly how yours will work. For information and help with your specific voicemail commands, refer to the help sites from the provider you chose. If you have an administrator, you can contact them for details and possible training.
Step 1
Pick up the handset or press the speaker icon.
Step 2
Enter the key combination to access your voicemail. Common options are *98 or *99.
Step 3
You will receive a prompt for the extension. Refer to the call controller to check the setting. This is most likely the same number of the extension of the phone. In some cases you may be given a different extention. Check with your voice administrator or service provider.
Step 4
You will receive a prompt for the password. Enter the mailbox number. This might be the number of the extension of the phone.
Step 5
You will receive a prompt to set a new password.
Step 6
At this point you will hear voice prompts that will list options to hear new voicemail.
Conclusion
You should now have accessed your voicemail on your Cisco 6800, 7800, and 8800 Series Multiplatform IP Phone.
If you would like to access your voicemail remotely, you should check with your call control provider. For some general information, check out Receive Voicemail Remotely on a Cisco 6800, 7800, or 8800 IP MPP Phone.
