Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCvh57985 Supplier notified a calibration error on 53 SN. CPN affected 10-3128-05 and 10-3230-01
Problem Description
A limited number of ONS-CFP2-WDM units might have a frequency error on one of the channels.
Background
A new frequency locker calibration test kit was introduced at transmitter optical sub-assembly (TOSA) testing. In rare cases an erroneous lock ratio datapoint could be recorded in the calibration table at one channel spectrum.
Problem Symptom
One channel on affected devices might have a frequency error due to incorrect calibration data and will not be set to the correct frequency. This issue only affects one channel per affected device, all other channels are unaffected and are set to the correct frequency.
For example, this table shows three different ONS-CFP2-WDM units. The units would function correctly outside the channel band mentioned, but will not work within the range due to incorrect calibration.
Note: This table is an example and it is not representative of the all affected SNs. Each SN would have a different, random, affected channel band.
Wavelength Band 1 with Calibration Error (nm)
1555.26
1554.96
1555.41
1555.11
1529.28
1528.96
Workaround/Solution
Cisco expects that units which function correctly in the field will continue to do so, but if the wavelength is changed there is a probability that the error channel could be selected. Therefore, Cisco recommends that you replace the unit when a frequency error on any of the channels is observed.
