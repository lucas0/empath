Introduction
This document describes what the behavior is after the upgrade to version 7.2, when EIGRP configuration is used in the MC/TD devices. 
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have basic knowledge of these topics:
EIGRP Protocol
FlexConfig feature
Upgrade process
Components Used
This feature was introduced in version 7.1 per the release note of that version. This document uses these software and hardware versions:
SecureFirewall Management Center (MC) version 7.1.0 and 7.2.0
SecureFirewall Threat Defense (TD) version 7.1.0 and 7.2.0
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Background Information
Prior to version 7.2, EIGRP configuration was supported in Secure Firewall Threat Defense devices via Flexconfig. In version 7.2, you can now use the management center web interface to configure EIGRP.
Notice for 7.3+:
After version 7.3, this migration script is deprecated. Refer to this guide on how to use FlexConfig Migration to configure EIGRP:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/secure-firewall/management-center/device-config/730/management-center-device-config-73/flex-config.html#Cisco_Task.dita_380221ea-8356-4343-b852-609e61a69193
Configurations
Prior to version 7.2, the EIGRP configuration is done as follows:
1. Create FlexConfig objects for EIGRP.
2. Assign the FlexConfig objects to the FlexConfig Policy. 
3. Finally, deploy this configuration to managed devices.
The EIGRP configuration via TD CLI is visualized with show commands:
firepower# show run router router eigrp 3  neighbor 10.40.2.2 interface OUTSIDE  network 10.40.2.0 255.255.255.0  
firepower# show run | inc eigrp
 authentication key eigrp 3 ***** key-id 120
 authentication mode eigrp 3 md5
 hello-interval eigrp 3 60
 hold-time eigrp 3 60
For this demonstration: Prior to the upgrade of the MC to version 7.2, the TD device has the previously shown EIGRP configuration. It was configured via FlexConfig.
Once the MC is upgraded to version 7.2, an automatic deployment gets available post-upgrade process. (This is normal behavior.)
After the deployment of this pending deployment post-upgrade, this warning appears:
Warning: FlexConfig Object includes commands for EIGRP that you can now configure and use the Threat Defense Routing policy. You must remove the objects and redo the configuration in the Threat Defense Routing policy (under Device Listing > Routing EIGRP).

This first deployment post-upgrade of the MC to version 7.2 is successful and does not remove the EIGRP configuration from TD.
Troubleshoot
Navigate to System > Monitoring > Audit. An audit log was created for the migration of the EIGRP Flexconfig configuration.
Open the report to confirm which EIGRP configuration was migrated to the MC UI.
