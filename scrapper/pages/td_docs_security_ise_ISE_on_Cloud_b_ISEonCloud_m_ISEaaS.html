Cisco ISE on Amazon Web Services
Extend the Cisco ISE policies in your home network to new remote deployments securely through Amazon Web Services (AWS).
You can configure and launch Cisco ISE in AWS through AWS CloudFormation Templates (CFTs) or Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). We recommend that you use CFTs through one of the ways in the following list. To launch Cisco ISE on AWS, perform one of the following procedures:
Launch a Cisco ISE CloudFormation Template Through AWS Marketplace
Launch Cisco ISE With CloudFormation Template
Launch a Cisco ISE AMI
CFTs are AWS solutions that allow you to easily create and manage cloud deployments. Extend your network into the cloud by creating a virtual private cloud in AWS and configure a virtual private gateway to enable communication with your organization's network over an IPsec tunnel.
The following illustration is only an example. You can place common services such as Certificate Authority (CA), Active Directory (AD), Domain Name System (DNS) servers, and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) on premises or in AWS, based on the requirements of your organization.
Figure 1. An Example of a Deployment Connected to AWS Cloud
For information about using CFTs in AWS, see the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
The following table contains details of the Cisco ISE instances that are currently available. You must purchase a Cisco ISE VM license to use any of the following instances. See Amazon EC2 On-Demand Pricing for information on EC2 instance pricing for your specific requirements.

Compute-optimized instances such as c5.4xlarge and c5.9xlarge are intended for compute-intensive tasks or applications and are best suited for Policy Service Node (PSN) use.
General purpose instances such as m5.4xlarge, m5.8xlarge, and m5.16xlarge are intended for data processing tasks and database operations and are best suited for use as Policy Administration Node (PAN) or Monitoring and Troubleshooting (MnT) nodes, or both.
If you use a general purpose instance as a PSN, the performance numbers are lower than the performance of a compute-optimized instance as a PSN.
The m5.2xlarge instance must be used as an extra small PSN only.
For information on the scale and performance data for AWS instances, see the Cisco ISE Performance and Scale guide.
For information on the scale and performance data for AWS instance types, see the Performance and Scalability Guide for Cisco Identity Services Engine.
You can leverage the AWS S3 storage service to easily store backup and restore files, monitoring and troubleshooting reports, and more.
Prerequisites to Create a Cisco ISE AWS Instance
You must be familiar with AWS solutions such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances and Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes, and concepts such as Regions, Availability Zones, Security Groups, Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and so on. See the AWS documentation for information on these solutions.
You must also be familiar with managing AWS service quotas.
You must configure VPC in AWS.
See VPC with public and private subnets and AWS Site-to-Site VPN access.
To create encrypted EBS volumes, your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy must allow access to Key Management Service (KMS) resources. See Policies and permissions in IAM.
Create security groups, subnets, and key pairs in AWS before you configure a Cisco ISE instance.
When you create a security group for Cisco ISE, you must create rules for all the ports and protocols for the Cisco ISE services you want to use. See Chapter "Cisco ISE Ports Reference" in the Cisco ISE Installation Guide for your release.
To configure an IPv6 address for the network interface, the subnet must have an IPv6 Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) pool that is enabled in AWS.
The IP address that you enter in the Management Network field in the Cisco ISE CloudFormation template must not be an IP address that exists as a network interface object in AWS.
You can configure a static IP as a private IP in your deployment. However, the static IP must be configured with a DNS-resolvable hostname.
Known Limitations of Using Cisco ISE on AWS
The following are the known limitations with using Cisco ISE in AWS:
You cannot take an Amazon EBS snapshot of a Cisco ISE instance and then create another EBS volume with the snapshot.
The Amazon VPC supports only Layer 3 features. Cisco ISE nodes on AWS instances do not support Cisco ISE functions that depend on Layer 1 and Layer 2 capabilities. For example, working with DHCP SPAN profiler probes and CDP protocols that use the Cisco ISE CLI is currently not supported.
NIC bonding is not supported.
Dual NIC is supported with only two NICsâ€”Gigabit Ethernet 0 and Gigabit Ethernet 1. To configure a secondary NIC in your Cisco ISE instance, you must first create a network interface object in AWS, power off your Cisco ISE instance, and then attach this network interface object to Cisco ISE. After you install and launch Cisco ISE on AWS, use the Cisco ISE CLI to manually configure the IP address of the network interface object as the secondary NIC.
Cisco ISE upgrade workflow is not available in Cisco ISE on AWS. Only fresh installs are supported. However, you can carry out backup and restore of configuration data. For information on upgrading hybrid Cisco ISE deployments, see Upgrade Guidelines for Hybrid Deployments.
SSH access to Cisco ISE CLI using password-based authentication is not supported in AWS. You can only access the Cisco ISE CLI through a key pair, and this key pair must be stored securely.
If you use a private key (or PEM) file and you lose the file, you will not be able to access the Cisco ISE CLI.
Any integration that uses a password-based authentication method to access Cisco ISE CLI is not supported, for example, Cisco DNA Center Release 2.1.2 and earlier.
You might receive an Insufficient Virtual Machine Resources alarm when Cisco ISE is in idle state. You can ignore this alarm because the CPU frequency is maintained lower than the required baseline frequency (2 GHz) for effective power conservation.
In the software version Cisco ISE 3.1, when you run the show inventory command through a Cisco ISE instance that is launched through AWS, the output for the command does not display the instance type of the Cisco ISE on AWS in the output. This issue does not occur with software versions Cisco ISE 3.1 Patch 1 and later releases.
You cannot configure an IPv6 server as an NTP server when launching Cisco ISE through AWS.
An initial administrator user account name, iseadmin, is generated by default. This user account name is used for both SSH and GUI access to Cisco ISE after the installation process is complete.
You cannot resize an EC2 instance.
You cannot convert the Cisco ISE Disk EBS Volume as an AMI and then relaunch another EC2 instance with this AMI.
You can integrate the external identity sources that are located on the premises. However, because of latency, when on-premises identity sources are used, Cisco ISE's performance is not at par with Cisco ISE's performance when AWS-hosted identity sources or the Cisco ISE internal user database is used.
The following deployment types are supported, but you must ensure that internode latencies are below 300 milliseconds:
Hybrid deployments with some Cisco ISE nodes on premises and some nodes in AWS.
Interregion deployments through VPC peering connections.
Amazon EC2 user data scripts are not supported.
In the Cisco ISE CFT that you configure, you define Volume Size in GB. However, AWS creates EBS storage volumes in Gibibyte (GiB). Therefore, when you enter 600 as the Volume Size in the Cisco ISE CFT, AWS creates 600 GiB (or 644.25 GB) of EBS volume.
When you run the restore operation during a configuration data backup through the Cisco ISE CLI or GUI, do not include the ADE-OS parameter.
Userdata retrieval only works for Metadata V1 (IMDSv1); it does not work with V2.

Note
The communication from on-prem devices to the VPC must be secure.
In Cisco ISE Release 3.1 Patch 3, Cisco ISE sends traffic to AWS Cloud through IP address 169.254.169.254 to obtain the instance details. This is to check if it is a cloud instance and can be ignored in on-prem deployments.
Launch a Cisco ISE CloudFormation Template Through AWS Marketplace
This method may launch standalone Cisco ISE instances only. To create a Cisco ISE deployment, see the Chapter "Deployment" in the Cisco ISE Administrator Guide for your release.

Note
You cannot add multiple DNS or NTP servers through the CFT. After you create a Cisco ISE instance, you can add more DNS or NTP servers through the Cisco ISE CLI. You also cannot configure IPv6 DNS or NTP servers through the CFT. Use the Cisco ISE CLI to configure IPv6 servers.
The Cisco ISE CFT creates an instance of the General Purpose SSD (gp2) volume type.

Step 12
Click Next: Add Storage.
Step 13
In the Step 4: Add Storage window:
Enter a value in the Size (GiB) column.
The valid range for this field is 279.4 to 2235.2 GiB. In a production environment, you must configure storage equal to or greater than 558.8 GiB. Storage lesser than 558.8 GiB only supports an evaluation environment. Note that Cisco ISE is created with storage defined in GB. The GiB value that you enter here is automatically converted into GB values during the Cisco ISE image-creation process. In GB, the valid storage range is 300 to 2400 GB, with 600 GB as the minimum value for a Cisco ISE in a production environment.
From the Volume Type drop-down list, choose General Purpose SSO (gp2).
To enable EBS encryption, from the Encryption drop-down list, choose an encryption key.

Step 19
In the Step 7: Review Instance Launch window, review all the configurations that you have created in this workflow. You can edit the values of these sections by clicking the corresponding Edit link.
Step 20
Click Launch.
Step 21
In the Select an existing key pair or create a new key pair dialog box choose one of the following options from the drop-down list:
Choose an existing key pair
Create a new key pair
Note
  To use SSH to log in to Cisco ISE, use a key pair where the username is iseadmin. The key pair must be kept intact. If the key pair is lost or corrupted, you cannot recover your Cisco ISE because you cannot map a new key pair to the existing instance.
Step 22
Check the check box for the acknowledgment statement and click Launch Instances.
The Launch Status window displays the progress of the instance creation.
Postinstallation Notes and Tasks
To check the status of the instance launch, in the left pane of the AWS console, click Instances. The Status Check column for the instance displays Initializing while the instance is being configured. When the instance is ready and available, the column displays x checks done.
You can access the Cisco ISE GUI or CLI about 30 minutes after the Cisco ISE EC2 instance is built. You can access the CLI and GUI of Cisco ISE with the IP address that AWS provides for your instance, and log in to the Cisco ISE administration portal or console.
When the Cisco ISE instance is ready and available for use, carry out the following steps:
When you create a key pair in AWS, you are prompted to download the key pair into your local system. Download the key pair because it contains specific permissions that you must update to successfully log in to your Cisco ISE instance from an SSH terminal.
If you use Linux or MacOS, run the following command from your CLI:
sudo chmod 0400 mykeypair.pem
If you use Windows:
Right-click the key file in your local system.
Choose Properties > Security > Advanced.
In the Permissions tab, assign full control to the appropriate user by clicking the corresponding option, and click Disable Inheritance.
In the Block Inheritance dialog box, click Convert inherited permissions into explicit permissions on this object.
In the Permissions tab, in the Permissions entries area, choose system and administrator users by clicking the corresponding entries, and then click Remove.
Click Apply, and then click OK.
Access the Cisco ISE CLI by running the following command in your CLI application:
ssh -i mykeypair.pem iseadmin@<Cisco ISE Private IP Address>
At the login prompt, enter iseadmin as the username.
At the system prompt, enter show application version ise and press Enter.
To check the status of the Cisco ISE processes, enter show application status ise and press Enter.
If the output displays that an application server is in Running state, Cisco ISE is ready for use.
You can then log in to the Cisco ISE GUI.
Carry out the postinstallation tasks listed in the topic "List of Post-Installation Tasks" in the Chapter "Installation Verification and Post-Installation Tasks" in the Cisco ISE Installation Guide for your release.
Compatibility Information for Cisco ISE on AWS
This section details compatibility information that is unique to Cisco ISE on AWS. For general compatibility details for Cisco ISE, see Cisco Identity Services Engine Network Component Compatibility, Release 3.1.
Cisco DNA Center Integration Support
You can connect your Cisco ISE to Cisco DNA Center Release 2.2.1 and later releases.
Load Balancer Integration Support
You can integrate the AWS-native Network Load Balancer (NLB) with Cisco ISE for load balancing the RADIUS traffic. However, the following caveats are applicable:
The Change of Authorization (CoA) feature is supported only when you enable client IP preservation in NLB.
Unequal load balancing might occur because NLB only supports source IP affinity and not the calling station ID-based sticky sessions.
Traffic can be sent to a Cisco ISE PSN even if the RADIUS service is not active on the node because NLB does not support RADIUS-based health checks.
You can integrate the AWS-native Network Load Balancer (NLB) with Cisco ISE for load balancing TACACS traffic. However, traffic might be sent to a Cisco ISE PSN even if the TACACS service is not active on the node because NLB does not support health checks based on TACACS+ services.
NIC Jumbo Frame Support
Cisco ISE supports jumbo frames. The Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) for Cisco ISE is 9,001 bytes, while the MTU of Network Access Devices is typically 1,500 bytes. Cisco ISE supports and receives both standard and jumbo frames without issue. You can reconfigure the Cisco ISE MTU as required, through the Cisco ISE CLI in configuration mode.

If you already have a repository that is accessible through the CLI, skip to step 4.
Step 4
To import the new Public Key, use the command crypto key import <public key filename> repository <repository name>
Step 5
When the import is complete, you can log in to Cisco ISE via SSH using the new public key.
Password Recovery
There is no mechanism for password recovery for Cisco ISE on AWS. You may need to create new Cisco ISE instances and perform backup and restore of configuration data.
Editing the user data for an EC2 instance in AWS does not change the CLI password that is used to log in to the serial console as the setup script is not run. The Cisco ISE virtual instance is not affected.
