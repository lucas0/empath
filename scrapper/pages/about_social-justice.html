Actions speak louder than words
In 2020, we transformed our longstanding advocacy for social justice into a global, enterprise-wide commitment to bolder action and greater impact. We embarked on a five-year journey backed by a US$300 million commitment to explore new ways to address inequities, break down barriers, and create more inclusive opportunities for people to thrive.
Our 12 Actions for Social Justice began as a commitment to the African American/Black community. They now serve as a blueprint that drives us forward, working together to create lasting, generational change—within Cisco, across our partners and suppliers, and in communities around the world.
Cisco's Social Justice Action Office brings together leaders and experts across our company to drive consistent execution, rigor, and accountability in our social justice actions.
