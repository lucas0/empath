Introduction
Cisco IOS XE release 16.10 provides enhanced support for Cisco Internet of Things (IoT) Switches.
For more information, see the Cisco IE 3200, 3300, and ESS 3300 Series Switches, Cisco IOS XE Gibralter 16.10.1 Software Configuration Guide .
New and Changed Information
Cisco Catalyst IE 3200 and 3300 Rugged Series Switches
The Cisco Catalyst IE 3x00 Series Switch is our next generation modular din rail Switching platform.
New Software Features in IOS XE Release 16.10
Release 16.10 introduces the following new software features for IoT Devices:
All features from Release 16.9.1 are now supported on the Cisco IE 3x00 series switch
Inter Vlan Routing feature support added
CIP (Common Industrial Protocol)
Precision Time Protocol (PTP)
Resilient Ethernet Protocol (REP)
Swap Drive
Netflow
Note: Due to HW limitation on IE3x00 platforms,
QoS Metering and NetFlow can-not co-exists on the same interface.
Number of flows support on IE3x00 is 1700
On Counters, Initial packets will not be accounted.
RSPAN
Known Issues
This section contains information about the known issues in this release.
IGMP Snooping and Unregistered Multicast Packet Forwarding
Symptoms: Although the mrouter port is configured and multicast receivers have sent igmp-joins to listen to registered multicast streams, unknown multicast streams that ingress the switch are forwarded to all the ports. The flooding may lead to reduction in bandwidth for registered multicast traffic.
Conditions: The issue occurs when the switch receives unregistered multicast packets with a pure L2 configuration and an external IGMP snooping querier is configured on the VLAN. There should not be a membership join received on any VLAN ports.
Workaround: To stop the VLAN, execute the command switchport block multicast on that interface, as shown in the following example:
Switch#configure terminal
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
Switch(config)#interface gigabitEthernet 1/10
Switch(config-if)#switchport block ?        
  multicast  Block unknown multicast addresses
  unicast    Block unknown unicast addresses
 
Switch(config-if)#switchport block mu
Switch(config-if)#switchport block multicast
