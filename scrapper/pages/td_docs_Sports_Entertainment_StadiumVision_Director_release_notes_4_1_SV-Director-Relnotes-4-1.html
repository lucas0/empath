Introduction
This document provides information about the Cisco StadiumVision solution for all releases of Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.1. It includes hardware and software requirements, new and changed features, installation and upgrade information, known issues, and defects.
This document is for Cisco StadiumVision system administrators and technical field engineers who are responsible for designing and deploying the Cisco StadiumVision solution. Readers of this document should be familiar with basic IP networking technology and the Cisco StadiumVision solution.
Key Considerations for This Release
Note This section provides a highlight of several important considerations for Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.1. Be sure to read the entire release note to obtain all relevant information for the release.
Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.1.0-508 (SP1) is considered a mandatory upgrade from Release 4.1.0-419.
The Platform 2 server (Cisco UCS C200) is no longer supported in Release 4.1 due to memory and performance limitations.
Cisco StadiumVision Director is supported in a virtual server environment or on the Platform 3 (Cisco UCS C220) as a bare metal install.
For more information about migrating, see the “Migrating From Platform 2 Servers to a Virtual Environment” module in the Cisco StadiumVision Director Software Installation and Upgrade Guide, Release 4.1.
A new auto-registration configuration is required after you install Release 4.1 and before you reboot your SV-4K and DMP-2K devices. For more information, see the “Multi-Firmware Version Upgrade on the SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Player” section.
The SV-4K and DMP-2K media player firmware can render most unicode characters as part of the DMP system fonts. This means that the font is available as a substitution font to external content sources such as HTML pages and feeds that might not explicitly reference web fonts in their CSS.
There is a new URL for download of the SV-4K and DMP-2K production firmware.
DMP-2K considerations:
– The DMP-2K is supported in production environments beginning in Release 4.1.0-419 and later releases.
– In prior firmware versions, the DMP does not negotiate 30W of power from the switch port and the DMP fails to turn on or otherwise displays unexpected behavior (CSCuy39197). This defect is resolved in Release 4.1.0-419 with firmware version 6.0.83. However, the following guidelines must be followed when deploying a new DMP-2K for the first time:
Caution For initial deployment of a new DMP-2K, be sure that:
—No other accessories are attached to the DMP-2K.
—You are using standard Category 5e or 6 cabling up to 100 m in length.
– The DMP-2K does not support any content with 4K resolution.
– The DHCP Option 60 Vendor Class Identifier string for new, factory-delivered DMP-2Ks is “Cisco DMP-2K”.
– HDMI-In encoder features are not supported on the DMP-2K.
– The DMP-2K uses the same firmware as the SV-4K.
– The DMP-2K has less total storage capacity (64 GB) than the SV-4K (120 GB). Available storage space on the DMP-2K is 65536 MB.
– The DMP-2K has 2 GB RAM compared with 3 GB RAM on the SV-4K. This can make a difference in how the same content might play on different media player models. This difference might more likely be seen when playing HTML pass-through (URL) content.
Release 4.1 introduces support for content with 4K resolution for video content only on the SV-4K media player. Graphics content remains capable of resolutions up to 1920 x 1080 only.
The new Cisco Solution Support Service is now available for Cisco StadiumVision.

Internationalization and Localization
Caution A Cisco StadiumVision Director system that is using language support from Release 4.0.0-707 (SP2) or Release 4.0.0-732 (SP3), will lose that support when first upgraded to Release 4.1, until language packs for the new release are installed. For more information, see the “Language Packs for Localization” section.
Internationalization (i18n)
Internationalization (known as i18n) support refers to the software infrastructure that is designed to accommodate multiple language translations (localization) without requiring additional engineering changes to that software.
The Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.1 software supports i18n for the following general areas of the solution:
Control Panel in Cisco StadiumVision Director
Dynamic Menu Board application
Management Dashboard in Cisco StadiumVision Director
IP Phone user interface
Software Manager
TV user interface
Localization (L10n)
Localization (known as L10n) refers to the implementation of the specific regional language translation support within a software interface that has been designed for i18n. In Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.1 English is the default language for the Cisco StadiumVision solution.
Note Certain locales are not supported in Release 4.1, such as right-to-left languages.
Language Packs for Localization
Note Language packs are release-specific. They are not available with the initial release of Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.1. You can install available language packs for Release 4.1, after you have installed or upgraded to Release 4.1, and when the 4.1 version of the language pack for the desired language is available.

An update to the initial set of language packs has been released to support localization fixes in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.1.0-508 (SP1). Although the latest release of language packs can be installed with Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.1.0-419, you need to upgrade to Release 4.1.0-508 first to get the full benefits of the localization changes.
Cisco StadiumVision Director provides increased flexibility to upload and install only the specific language(s) that you want to support through the independent installation of Language Packs. The upload and installation of the language packs is performed using the Software Manager from the Cisco StadiumVision Director main menu. For more information about how to install language packs, see the Cisco StadiumVision Director Software Installation and Upgrade Guide, Release 4.1.
Caution A Cisco StadiumVision Director system that is using language support from Release 4.0.0-707 (SP2) or Release 4.0.0-732 (SP3) will lose that support when first upgraded to Release 4.1, until language packs for Release 4.1 are available and installed.
The supported languages in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.1.0-419 and later are:
Deutsch (de_DE)
English (en_US). This is the default locale in all Cisco StadiumVision Director releases.

Content Feature Enhancements
Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.1 provides the following content enhancements:
Guidelines for 4K Video Content on the SV-4K Media Player
4K Local Video on the SV-4K Media Player
HDMI-In Encoding on the SV-4K Media Player to Stream Video as a Channel in Cisco StadiumVision Director
HDMI-In as a Video Source in a Region on the SV-4K Media Player
Improvement in Requirements for Video Content Synchronization on the SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Players
Guidelines for 4K Video Content on the SV-4K Media Player
Note Only 4K video content is supported in Release 4.1. 4K graphics are not supported.
4K Video Encoding Guidelines
Note Be sure to test the devices that you plan to connect to the SV-4K HDMI-In port to stream content for support of HDCP. Most Mac OS and Windows laptops should work for HDMI-In video encoding for non-copy-protected content. It is up to the device manufacturer and OS whether or not this is supported.
Before preparing 4K video content for the SV-4K media player, be sure that your content meets the following requirements:
Video encoding—H.265 High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC).
H.265 version 1 profiles only—Main and Main 10.
Video encode bit rate (vbitrate)—2000 to 25000 Kbps.
Maximum streaming bit rate (with HDMI-In encoding)—Two times the video encode bit rate is recommended.
Constant Bit Rate (CBR)—Recommended for all local video on the SV-4K.
For more information about content guidelines, see the Cisco StadiumVision Content Creation Design and Specification Guide.
4K Video Restrictions
Before preparing 4K video content for the SV-4K media player, consider the following restrictions:
H.264 video encoding is not supported. Be sure that your content tools support H.265 encoding.
Display of dual 4K video regions is not supported.
The 4K video region should be played in the primary video region only. A secondary video region can support up to HD (1920x1080) video resolution.
4K video can be displayed in full ultra HD resolution (3840x2160) when using any of the Cisco StadiumVision Director templates using the primary video region.
Video with 4K resolution is not supported for HDMI-In streaming on the SV-4K.
No luma key can be applied to 4K video. Luma keying is only supported with 4K for dual video when an HD video in the secondary region uses a luma key over a 4K video in the primary region.
The Screen Template editor in Cisco StadiumVision Director presents all region sizes based on an HD 1920x1080 canvas size—do not configure templates based on the ultra HD size of 3840x2160 when using a 4K display.
Tip The best practice when using any templates with native 4K video, is to design all content/regions for HD 1920x1080. The image content that is displayed with the 4K video will resize proportionally to a 3840x2160 canvas size automatically.
If you are using a 4K display, you must configure a fixed resolution value of 3840x2160x60p in the sv4k.videoMode serial command in the TV display specification (Figure 2).
Figure 2 Fixed 4K Resolution Setting in the sv4k.videoMode Serial Command
  For more information about how to specify the TV display resolution, see the “Configuring Resolution Under Control Panel Display Specifications” in the Cisco StadiumVision Director Operations Guide, Release 4.1.
4K Local Video on the SV-4K Media Player
Note This feature is only supported on the SV-4K media player.
WHAT IS IT
Feature to support import of 4K video into the Cisco StadiumVision Director content library and playing it through a playlist.
WHY USE IT
When you want to display an independent 4K video as part of a typical playlist setup for an SV-4K media player.
FOR MORE INFORMATION
“Guidelines for 4K Video Content on the SV-4K Media Player” section.
“Importing Local Video and Content Images to the Content Library” topic in the Cisco StadiumVision Director Operations Guide.
“Working With Playlists in Cisco StadiumVision Director” topic in the Cisco StadiumVision Director Operations Guide.
HDMI-In Encoding on the SV-4K Media Player to Stream Video as a Channel in Cisco StadiumVision Director
Note ● This feature requires a separate encoder software license. For more information, see the “Product IDs in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.1 for Software Licenses” section.
Be sure to test the devices that you plan to connect to the SV-4K HDMI-In port to stream content for HDCP support. Most Mac OS and Windows laptops should work for HDMI-In video encoding for non-copy-protected content. It is up to the device manufacturer and OS whether or not this is supported.
  WHAT IS IT
Feature to support streaming video from a laptop or other supported device connected to the HDMI-In port on an SV-4K media player to be played as a multicast-based channel in Cisco StadiumVision Director.
The allowable multicast range to use for this feature in the Connected Stadium network is 239.193.20.0/24.
Start/stop of video streaming is performed by script action (see Figure 7), IP phone, IR remote, User Control API, or command in the Management Dashboard.
Control of playing the video at the location is through local control—IP phone, IR remote, or user control (local control) API.
If you set up a channel guide for multiple suites, then you will also need to select the logical local channel that you set up for HDMI-In. Figure 3 shows an example of an IR remote menu with HDMI-In channels available for selection.
Figure 3 IR Remote Menu for Selection of HDMI-In Broadcast Channel
  WHY USE IT
When you want to stream video from a laptop (or other supported device) to a particular suite or area in the venue as a channel that you can tune to from the location by local control.
WHERE TO CONFIGURE IT
Note If you want to maintain privacy of channels, create a DMP-encoded channel per suite with a unique multicast address (from 239.193.20.0/24 range), and create a separate channel guide per suite.
For example, if you have 10 suites—create 10 separate DMP-encoded channels with unique multicast addresses, create 10 different channel guides for each DMP-encoded channel, and assign each suite to a different channel guide.

HDMI-In as a Video Source in a Region on the SV-4K Media Player
Note Be sure to test the devices that you plan to connect to the SV-4K HDMI-In port to stream content for HDCP support. Most Mac OS and Windows laptops should work for HDMI-In video encoding for non-copy-protected content. It is up to the device manufacturer and OS whether or not this is supported.
WHAT IS IT
Feature to support streaming video from a laptop or other supported device connected to the HDMI-In port on an SV-4K media player to be played in a video region that is set up as a video source when scheduling a script and without creating a playlist.
Local HDMI-In is added under Channels/Video Sources tab.
Control of playing the video at the location is through the script.
WHY USE IT
When you want to play video through HDMI-In and control it through script scheduling. You can also set this up for a private event to start streaming and then be able to play video when ready in that location.
WHERE TO CONFIGURE IT
  FOR MORE INFORMATION

Improvement in Requirements for Video Content Synchronization on the SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Players
Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.1 eliminates the following requirements for video content synchronization from Release 4.0:
Templates no longer need to be identical.
Only video regions (primary and secondary) are compared. Primary regions are compared to primary regions, and secondary regions are compared to secondary regions. Non-video regions are ignored for synchronization.
Disable Display of Address Information on Media Player Startup
WHAT IS IT
Feature that adds a registry key in the Management Dashboard to control display of IP and MAC address information on the TV display when a media player starts up. By default, the address information is displayed to help with media player deployment and troubleshooting.
WHY USE IT
Use this feature to disable the display of device address information on the TV display in a public area when the media player is restarted to help protect network information at the venue.
WHERE TO CONFIGURE IT
Go to the Registry in the Management Dashboard and change the value for the device.SvDMP.showAddressOnstartup key to false.
  Media Player Enhancements
Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.1 introduces the following media player enhancements:
AC3+ Support on the SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Player
Configurable Multicast Video Tune-In Timeout
New HTML5 Rendition Engine for the SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Player
Portrait Mode Content Renditions for SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Players (Beta Feature Only)
PTP Master Election Per VLAN for SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Players
SNMP Agent Service for the SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Player
SV-4K and DMP-2K System Font Support
AC3+ Support on the SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Player
Beginning in Release 4.1.0-419 the SV-4K and DMP-2K media player support Dolby Digital AC3+ audio decodes.
Configurable Multicast Video Tune-In Timeout
Note This feature is introduced in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.1.0-508 (SP1).
WHAT IS IT
The Video tune-in timeout is a new common DMP setting for the SV-4K and DMP-2K media player that allows the default timeout of 500 ms to be changed. The value is used for receiving multicast video information on the network and for DCM failure detection.
WHY USE IT
Certain venues might encounter network conditions requiring a change in this value to properly tune multicast video operation.
WHERE TO CONFIGURE IT
Go to Management Dashboard > SV Director Configuration > System Configuration > Global DMP Settings > SV-DMP Common Settings and configure a new value in milliseconds for the “Video tune-in timeout” property. After you change and refresh the property value, you must reboot the DMP(s).
  New HTML5 Rendition Engine for the SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Player
Firmware version 6.0.83 introduces a new rendition engine for HTML5 content. For information about HTML5 content guidelines, see the Cisco StadiumVision Content Design and Specification Guide.
Portrait Mode Content Renditions for SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Players (Beta Feature Only)
Caution Portrait mode rendition support is introduced as a Beta feature. As a Beta feature, the portrait mode functionality is not fully tested or supported. Therefore, it is not intended for production environments due to the potential of unexpected behavior.
WHAT IS IT
Portrait mode is a new rendition mode enabled by serial command for TV displays controlled by SV-4K or DMP-2K media players. It allows the DMPs to automatically rotate content for proper orientation on vertically-positioned displays.
Consider the following restrictions:
Portrait mode is not supported with HDMI-In encoding or streaming on the SV-4K.
Certain startup and diagnostic screens do not rotate and appear cut off on the display.
WHY USE IT
Use portrait mode for vertical TV displays to test auto-rotation of content that would otherwise be improperly cut off and displayed sideways with the default landscape orientation.
WHERE TO CONFIGURE IT
Go to Control Panel > Setup > Devices > Display Specifications and select or add your display. In the Serial Commands panel, add the “dmp.portrait” command and set it to true.
  Note The use of portrait mode implies that your video mode (sv4k.videoMode) is set to 1920x1080x60p and that you are using templates designed for content up to 1920 pixels high and 1080 pixels wide. The default canvas will still show horizontal orientation, but you can add regions that extend beyond the canvas.
PTP Master Election Per VLAN for SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Players
WHAT IS IT
Feature that implements a new Precision Time Protocol (PTP) Time To Live (TTL) setting that controls the number of VLANs that can be crossed for selection of a PTP master. The default value of 1 means that each VLAN will elect its own PTP master.
WHY USE IT
Best practice is to retain the default value of 1 for election of a PTP master per video wall. With a TTL > 1, degradation in local video synchronization can occur.
WHERE TO CONFIGURE IT
  FOR MORE INFORMATION
See the “Configuring the Cisco StadiumVision Director Server System Settings” module in the Cisco StadiumVision Director Server Administration Guide, Release 4.1.
SNMP Agent Service for the SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Player
WHAT IS IT
The Start SNMP Agent Service is a new common DMP setting for the SV-4K and DMP-2K media player that uses port 161 for both input/output on the device. The service supports SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 and GET operations. You can use the snmpwalk command to retrieve MIB values. SNMP traps are not supported.
WHY USE IT
The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Agent Service should be enabled as determined by the venue’s requirements for the exchange of device management information in their network.
WHERE TO CONFIGURE IT
  SV-4K and DMP-2K System Font Support
The SV-4K and DMP-2K media player firmware can render most unicode characters as part of the DMP system fonts. This means that the font is available as a substitution font to external content sources such as HTML pages and feeds that might not explicitly reference fonts in their CSS.
Multi-Firmware Version Upgrade on the SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Player
Caution Immediately after installing Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.1, you must configure the new auto-registration settings in the Management Dashboard described here and in the “Upgrading the SV-4K and DMP-2K Firmware” module of the Cisco StadiumVision Director Software Installation and Upgrade Guide, Release 4.1.

Failure to perform this configuration can cause the media player to repeatedly boot.
WHAT IS IT
A new auto-registration process that preserves a required firmware upgrade sequence in Release 4.1 for the SV-4K and DMP-2K media player.
Introduces concept of base firmware version, in addition to the current production firmware version.
– Base firmware—A prerequisite firmware version that is required before provisioning of the production firmware version. Can be version 5.1.52, 5.1.65, or 5.1.68.1.
– Production firmware version—Firmware version required to operate the media player in Release 4.1.
With proper configuration, allows the run-time software to identify the existing firmware version on the device, automatically provision the base firmware (as required), and provision the production firmware version.
WHY IT IS REQUIRED
Early versions of media player firmware (such as on factory-shipped devices) are not supported for direct upgrade to the production firmware version in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.1.
The Multi-Firmware Version Upgrade feature automates this upgrade sequence as required to simplify the process.
WHERE TO CONFIGURE IT
Go to Management Dashboard > SV Director Configuration > System Configuration > Auto Registration Settings and configure the four required properties shown in Figure 4 and according to Table 18 .
Tip For upgrades from devices with firmware version 5.1.52, 5.1.65, or 5.1.68.1, you can simply select that existing firmware as your “Base firmware image to use” since that firmware version is already uploaded to Cisco StadiumVision Director and is a valid prerequisite firmware version. Then, type the corresponding firmware version number in the “base.version” field.

The backup task can now run even while an event script is running. As part of this change, the database is no longer optimized or repaired during the backup process—a new TUI option is added to run database maintenance manually if needed.
Although it is not expected that database maintenance should be needed on a regular basis, a possible symptom could be slow performance indicating a need to run database maintenance.
Tip You can look at the backup log (/var/log/svd-config/backup-YYYMMddHHMMSSz.log) to see if the table updates are “OK” and up-to-date. If not, then use the TUI option to run database maintenance. For more information, see the “StadiumVision Server Administration Menu: Database Maintenance” section.
Media Player Storage
Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.1 reduces the storage required for SV-4K and DMP-2K content on the Cisco StadiumVision Director server.
No configuration is required for this enhancement.
Text Utility Interface
The following Text Utility Interface (TUI) changes are introduced:
Services Control Menu: Network Time Sync
StadiumVision Server Administration Menu: Database Maintenance
Services Control Menu: Network Time Sync
The Services Control menu has been modified to add the “Network Time Sync” option.
WHAT IS IT
A new TUI option that allows you to independently start and stop the network time service (ntpd) in Cisco StadiumVision Director. You also can check status of the service.
WHY USE IT
If for some reason the ntpd service does not start after a server reboot or power failure, this provides a more convenient way to restart it. Prior to this option, you had to rely on editing the ntp.conf file to initiate a restart.
WHERE TO CONFIGURE IT
    FOR MORE INFORMATION
See the “Cisco StadiumVision Director Text Utility Interface” in the Cisco StadiumVision Director Server Administration Guide, Release 4.1.
StadiumVision Server Administration Menu: Database Maintenance
The StadiumVision Server Administration menu has been modified to add the “Database Maintenance” option.
WHAT IS IT
A new TUI option that allows you to optimize and repair the Cisco StadiumVision Director database.
WHY USE IT
The database is no longer optimized or repaired during the backup process. You can look at the backup log (/var/log/svd-config/backup- YYYMMddHHMMSSz.log) to see if the table updates are “OK” and up-to-date. If not, then you can use this TUI option to run database maintenance.

Deployment Guidelines for the SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Players
This section includes the following topics:
Deployment Guidelines for the DMP-2K Media Player
Deployment Guidelines for the SV-4K Media Player
New Firmware Configuration for the SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Player
Firmware Download for the SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Player
Deployment Guidelines for the DMP-2K Media Player
Before you deploy the DMP-2K media player, consider the following guidelines:
The DMP-2K has the same requirement as the SV-4K for PoE+ for 30W of port power on the Cisco Connected Stadium switch. Be sure that your switch can meet these and the other requirements for deployment of the device.
Caution For initial deployment of a new DMP-2K, be sure that:
—No other accessories are attached to the DMP-2K.
—You are using standard Category 5e or 6 cabling up to 100 m in length.
Be sure to configure your DHCP server with the corresponding Option 43 and Option 60 strings for the DMP-2K. Use “Cisco DMP-2K” for the Option 60 Vendor Class Identifier string for new DMPs shipped from the factory.
Note This Option 60 string is “Brightsign DMP-2K” for early prototypes.
Deployment Guidelines for the SV-4K Media Player
Note The SV-4K media player has different requirements than the Cisco DMP 4310G, including, but not limited to support of PoE+ for 30W of port power on the Cisco Connected Stadium switch. Be sure that your switch can meet these and the other requirements for deployment of the SV-4K.
For more information, see:
Cisco StadiumVision SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Player Deployment Guide
Cisco Connected Stadium Design Guide (available to qualified Cisco StadiumVision partners in the Sports & Entertainment Partner Portal)
New Firmware Configuration for the SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Player
Caution Immediately after installing Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.1, you must configure the new auto-registration settings in the Management Dashboard to install the firmware on the DMPs. Failure to perform this new configuration can cause the media player to repeatedly boot.
In Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.1, the SV-4K and DMP-2K media players require that a minimum—or base— firmware version is provisioned before they can be upgraded to the production firmware version supported in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.1.
A new auto-registration configuration requirement and feature is introduced to ensure that this required firmware upgrade sequence is automatically preserved for affected media players in the system.
For more information, see the “Multi-Firmware Version Upgrade on the SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Player” section. This also is documented in the “Upgrading the SV-4K and DMP-2K Firmware” module of the Cisco StadiumVision Director Software Installation and Upgrade Guide, Release 4.1.
Firmware Download for the SV-4K and DMP-2K Media Player
The SV-4K and DMP-2K media player firmware image is not bundled with the Cisco StadiumVision Director software.
Tip Be sure to download the firmware to a device that you also can use to access the Cisco StadiumVision Director software.
Downloading the SV-4K and DMP-2K Production Firmware
To download the SV-4K and DMP-2K production firmware, go to:
https://www.brightsign.biz/downloads/dmp-firmware-download-6083-0516
Downloading the SV-4K and DMP-2K Base Firmware
If you do not already have one of the required base firmware versions uploaded to Cisco StadiumVision Director, you must download the firmware image separately from a password-protected site and then upload it to Cisco StadiumVision Director.
Contact your Cisco Systems representative for the “ How to Download SV-4K Firmware” document, available to qualified Cisco StadiumVision partners.
Limitations and Restrictions
When using Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.1, be aware of the following limitations and restrictions:
Caution Proof of play raw data repository in /var/sv/pofp/raw directory is not part of the backup process. In normal operation, a completed script with a green dot already has a copy of the raw data and is part of the backup data. No further action is needed aside from generating the PoP report. For completed scripts that do not have a green dot, it is very important to investigate or call for support within 60 days of the event, after which time the PoP messages in the raw directory will be deleted.
If you have previously accessed a different Cisco StadiumVision Director version on your computer, sometimes unexpected behavior or warnings arise, or you might access an older version of the interface. In this case, and especially after an upgrade, you must clear your browser cache.
The first release of Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.1 implements the infrastructure only to support i18n and L10n to support the independent installation of other language packs with Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 4.1 as they become available.
Cisco StadiumVision Director does not support internationalization for back-end messaging.
Non-English characters are not supported as a Cisco StadiumVision Director login credential.
Multi-user support in Cisco StadiumVision Director is limited to script editing only. No other Control Panel functions for templates, zones, groups, and playlists support a multi-user environment, and these areas can be deleted by other users. However, users are notified about potential impact due to currently locked scripts and are prompted for confirmation of deletion and given an option to use instant messaging to coordinate with the script owner.
No more than 10 user sessions can be supported at any one time in the Management Dashboard and Control Panel areas. The system does not prevent more than 10 sessions to be opened, so you need to be careful that you do not exceed this limit.
No more than 50 staging threads can be processing in Cisco StadiumVision Director at any one time. The default maximum is 10. The maximum is configured using the “stagingThreadNum” registry found under the Tools > Advanced > Registry section of the Management Dashboard.
Note If auto-registration is enabled and a new DMP is detected, then Cisco StadiumVision Director initiates staging and always uses 50 as the maximum value. In this case, the stagingThreadNum registry setting is ignored and remains unchanged.
Important Notes
This section includes other important information about the Cisco StadiumVision solution that you should know for optimal operation. It includes the following topics:
Media Player Maintenance Recommendations
System Utilization Values
System Utilization Values
Media Player Maintenance Recommendations
To avoid unexpected behavior and maintain normal operation of your devices, it is highly recommended that you perform a soft reboot of all of the media players in your system:
Cisco DMP 4310G—Weekly.
SV-4K—Weekly.
DMP-2K—Every 5 days.
You can reboot DMPs manually or configure a periodic task to run automatically. Remember that the automatic scheduled task applies globally to all media players in the system.
Note Before you perform a reboot, be sure that there are not any active scripts running.
For more information see the “ How to Configure the Reboot DMP System Task From the Management Dashboard ” task note.
System Utilization Values
Measurement units for storage in Cisco StadiumVision Director are based on a KB equivalent of 1024 bytes [known as a kibibyte)KiB)], not 1000 bytes.
Therefore, a notation of MB actually means 1,048,576 (1024 x 1024) bytes in Cisco StadiumVision Director.

CSCuz65985—Editing single occurrence in a recurring event keeps earlier event intact.
Symptom Change of script while editing a single occurrence in a recurring event keeps the earlier event intact.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Create a recurring daily/weekly event.
2. Edit the single occurrence in the recurring event.
3. Change the script.
Workaround There is no workaround.
CSCuz53399—Unable to create daily/weekly event with end by date in Firefox browser.
Symptom Unable to create daily/weekly event with an “end by” date using the Mozilla Firefox browser.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Log into Cisco StadiumVision Director.
2. Go to the Scheduler.
3. Create script and enter event Name.
4. Enter start & end date time of event.
5. Select the Option 'Repeat Event'
6. Select Daily/weekly and enter 'End by' date.
7. Select any Future date to multiple events and Save it
Workaround Use Google Chrome browser or select “Occurrences” instead of “End by” option when using Firefox to create multiple events.
CSCuy49935—Sometimes saving a change in the Management Dashboard does not propagate to the DMP.
Symptom Changes made in the Management Dashboard are not always sent to the DMP. If multiple changes made then the previous change appears to be the one that is saved.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Go to the Management Dashboard.
2. Go to SV Director Configuration > System Configuration > Global DMP Settings > SV-4K Settings.
3. Change the Timezone to another value.
4. Reboot the DMP.
5. If the behavior occurs where the change is not sent to the DMP:
a. Change the Timezone to a new value.
b. Reboot the DMP again.
Workaround Restart StadiumVision Director Services.
CSCuz49064—Widgets fail to display data integration when a bound XML value is blank.
Symptom If an XML data source has a blank result such as <data></data>, then that field simply shows up blank in the widget designer. However, on the SV-4K it breaks multiple fields in the widget. The XML payload is randomized, so the order of transmission of elements is unknown. The actual behavior is that all fields after the null value are broken.
Workaround Use TextArea instead of T2S elements to avoid this defect.
CSCuz44956—Scoreboard controller / clock fails to process when mule is overwhelmed.
Symptom When Data Integration application (svd-broker) is overwhelmed by requests, the broker will not process game scores or game clocks, which need to be polled “reliably” every 1 second without conflicts.
Workaround Check affected widgets to be sure that they are not using the Data Pull component. Need to use multicast type payload for reliable scoreboard / clock operation. Otherwise, there is no workaround.
CSCuy88169—JSON format in broker does not support arrays at "root" level.
Symptom When Creating a generic data source in JSON format, if the JSON file starts with [, then SVD will give an "Invalid JSON provided as payload for upload. EB00011" error while trying to upload the sample JSON file in the field mapping tab.
Workaround Add {"Array": at the start of the JSON data before [ and at the end add }.
CSCuy10156—Scheduler - Editing a running event causes multiple staging.
Symptom User is allowed to edit the event, change the details of the event even after the event fires off, and each time the edited event get saved, staging happens at the back end. The event is saved with the very last changes made from the scheduler side. Multiple concurrent events are created in the Control Panel because of the multiple edits in the Scheduler for the event. It was observed that only the last instance is in the “running” state, and other instances are being blocked.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Go to the Scheduler.
2. Schedule an event with heavy content (large video files).
3. Try to edit the event when the event starts - within the first 60 seconds after the event kicks off.
Workaround There is no workaround.

b. Set the 'repeat every' value to 2.
In this case, the maximum value should be changed to half of 365, but it stays at 365. The scheduled events spans for two years which is not allowed as per design.
4. Select the weekly event option and try the following steps:
a. Set the 'repeat every' value to 1.
b. Select one day of the week.
The boundary value for 'after' for this combination is 52 (the maximum occurrences that can be scheduled is 52 since any scheduled event cannot span for more than 365 days as per design).
c. Keep the value 1 for 'repeat every' and choose more than one day of the week. The maximum occurrence scheduled should be double, but scheduler wont allow more than 52.
Workaround When scheduling weekly events for more than a year, use the ‘End By’ option instead of the ‘after’ option.
CSCuy25570—Mute/Volume 0 on Internal volume strategy is set to 13.
Symptom When using internal volume strategy and setting 0 volume level (either by IR or IP Phone) the volume will go to level 13 instead of 0. The volume does not get muted; instead, it drops to a still-audible level. The same occurs if the volume is currently at 5 and you press volume down, it jumps to 13.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Create a display specification where the volume strategy is set to “Internal.”
2. Assign one or more SV-4K or DMP-2K devices to that display spec.
3. Restart the runtime on the assigned DMPs.
4. Go to the TVs connected to those DMPs, and using the TV manufacturer's IR controller, set the volume to 100%.
5. Using the DMP IR controller, raise the volume to a high level (anywhere from 50% to 100%), you can check the volume level by running a Get Status command in the Management Dashboard and looking at the display data.
6. Press Mute.
Workaround There is no workaround.
CSCuy25798—BackupTask and manual backup removes DMPs from active script.
Symptom Sometimes the scheduled BackupTask or manual backup removes DMPs from an active script.
Workaround Stop any running scripts before running the backup task and start the scripts only after the backup task is run.
CSCuw54955—Backup restore sometimes fail to copy saved firmware to SVD server location.
Symptom After performing a backup restore process, all of the firmware files present on the backup are not restored in the dashboard. This occurs intermittently.
Workaround User will need to upload the firmware files again in order to use them.
CSCux47258—SV-4K: When Insignia TV is powered on it may cause DMP to reboot.
Symptom SV-4K: When the Insignia TV is powered on, it may cause the DMP to reboot. This behavior only occurs if resolution is set to auto-detect. This is a firmware issue.
Workaround In the display specification, set the resolution to "1920x1080x60p" instead of using auto-detect.
CSCux41638—SV-4K: The ptp.html page only shows neighbors with PTP TTL=1.
Symptom SV-4K: The ptp.html page only shows neighbors with PTP TTL=1.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. In the Management Dashboard, the "PTP time-to-live" setting is > 1.
2. Launch the page at "http://x.x.x.x/ptp.html where x.x.x.x is the IP address of the DMP.
Notice that this page only shows DMPs that are within 1 hop (TTL = 1). DMPs that are > 1 hop (TTL > 1) is not shown. This is a firmware limitation.
Workaround Choose a DMP in each hop and bring up the ptp.html page to view PTP status of DMPs within that hop.
CSCux38701—SV-4K: Status - CPU usage - should display accurate information.
Symptom Only integer values are shown on the Dashboard for CPU usage. CPU usage always shows zero on the Dashboard when the usage is below 1. It does not show the decimal part even when the usage is greater than 1.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Install the SV-4K DMP.
2. Check the status by going to the Management Dashboard > DMP and TV Controls > Monitoring > Get Status.
3. Look at the status details under the status tab. Notice that decimal values are not displayed for CPU usage.
Workaround There is no workaround.
CSCux36786—Restart D.I.B server error display if DB datasource name contains “_”.
Symptom Restarting Data Integration (broker) displays an error if DB datasource name contains "_".
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Log into Cisco StadiumVision Director.
2. Go to Control Panel > Data Integration.
3. Create any Generic data Source with database.
4. Enter the name of the data source to contain "_".
5. Deploy the data source.
6. Restart the Data Integration Broker server.
Workaround
1. Log into the TUI > Troubleshooting > Undeploy all data source in Data Integration, then restart the integration server.
2. Create a new data source without "_" in the name.
3. Restart Data Integration Broker in Dashboard.
CSCux33272—Audio is missing while streaming with DVD Player using HDMI splitter.
Symptom Audio is missing while streaming with DVD Player using HDMI splitter.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Login to Cisco StadiumVision Director.
2. Ensure that a source SV-4K DMP is added to devices > group1 > zone1, then add another target SV-4K DMP to devices > group2 > zone2.
3. Ensure that the HDMI out of the DVD player is plugged in to the HDMI-Input of the splitter and that the HDMI-Out of the splitter to HDMI-In of same source DMP.
4. Navigate to the Management Dashboard.
5. Select the source SV-4K and start streaming by providing the multicast IP address and src type =hdmi.
6. Select Start Streaming.
7. Select target/Encoder SV4K.
8. Set the video channel to the same multicast IP where streaming occurs.
Expected Result:
Video should be streamed along with audio.
Actual Result:
The audio stream is missing, while the video is being streamed to the target DMP.
Workaround This is no workaround.
CSCux31767—CCM: Group info disappears while performing individual refresh of DMP.
