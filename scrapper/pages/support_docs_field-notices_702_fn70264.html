CSCvi63921 CGR1K - GPS Fails with "No GPS Signal Available" or "Weak GPS Signal, may not be accurate"
Problem Description
A limited number of CGR1120 and CGR1240 units might experience GPS failures.
For CGR1120/K9 and CGR1240/K9 units that are in a fixed location, a workaround is available.
For CGR1120/K9 and CGR1240/K9 units that are not in a fixed location, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC).
Background
GPS failures were seen in a customer environment prior to deployment in the field. The root cause was identified as damaged inductors, which supply voltage to the integrated active GPS antenna. The damage is the result of an overcurrent condition in one of the manufacturing environments.
Problem Symptom
Customers might see one of these messages when a GPS failure occurs by entering the show platform gps location command:
Cisco IOS® - “No GPS Signal Available” or “Weak signal, reading may not be accurate”
CG-OS - "Unable to communicate with GPS"
Note: If the CGR is already in service, the fixed GPS coordinates will not change in Field Network Director (FND). The GPS coordinates will continue to show in the FND map as the same fixed location.
Workaround/Solution
For CGR1120/K9 and CGR1240/K9 units that are in a fixed location, a workaround is available. Complete these steps in order to input the GPS coordinates into FND.
If the CGR is not deployed to a fixed location and GPS coordinates are required, the customer can contact Cisco TAC for assistance.
