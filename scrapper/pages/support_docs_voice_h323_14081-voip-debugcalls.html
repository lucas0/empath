Introduction
This document describes the basic techniques and commands to troubleshoot and debug VoIP networks.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:
VoIP configuration
Voice QoS
Design and Deployment of VoIP networks
Components Used
This document is not restricted to specific software and hardware versions. However, the outputs shown are based on Cisco IOS® Software Release 12.3(8).
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Conventions
For more information on document conventions, refer to the Cisco Technical Tips Conventions.
Background Information
This document demonstrates basic techniques and commands to troubleshoot and debug VoIP networks. An overview of the Voice Call Flow and Telephony Architecture in a Cisco Router is presented, followed by a step-by-step VoIP troubleshooting approach presented in these steps:
Verify digital and analog signaling.
Verify digits received and sent from the analog and digital voice ports.
Verify end-to-end VoIP signaling.
Understand VoIP Quality of Service (QoS) issues.
Understand details of cause codes and debug values for VoIP.
Note: This document does not explain every facet of the Cisco IOS architecture used in Cisco VoIP gateways and gatekeepers. Instead, it is intended to show which commands can be used and which fields from the command outputs can be most valuable.
Caution: It is processor intensive to debug Cisco IOS. Exercise caution when you use the debugs listed in this document. For more information, refer to Important Information on Debug Commands.
Debugs need to be run with timestamps enabled in the log. Enable timestamping with the commands:  service timestamps debug datetime msec, service timestampslog datetime msec in enable mode. The timestamps help determine the interval of time between state changes.
Call Flow in the Network
An important factor to consider before you start any VoIP troubleshooting or debugging is that VoIP calls are made up of three call legs. These call legs are source Plain Old Telephone Systems (POTS), VoIP, and destination POTS. This is shown in this diagram. Troubleshooting and debugging needs to first focus on each leg independently and then on the VoIP call as a whole.
Router Call Flow
These definitions explain the function of the main components displayed in the router call flow diagram:
Call Control API (Application Programming Interface)—Three clients make use of the call control API. The three clients are CLI, simple network management protocol (SNMP) agent, and the Session Application. The Call Control API (also referred to as CCAPI) main functions are to:
Identify the call legs (for example, which dial peer is it? where did it come from?).
Decide which session application takes the call (for example, who handles it?).
Invoke the packet handler.
Conference the call legs together.
Start to record call statistics.
Session Application and Dial Plan Mapper—The Session Application uses the Dial Plan Mapper to map a number to a dial-peer (local POTS or remote VoIP). The Dial Plan Mapper uses the Dial Peer Table to find active dial-peers.
Telephony and VoIP Service Provider Interface (SPI)—The Telephony SPI communicates with the POTS (analog: fxs, fxo, e&m Digital: isdn, qsig, e&m, and so forth) dial-peers. The VoIP SPI is the specific interface to the VoIP peers. Telephony/DSP drivers deliver services to the Telephony SPI while the VoIP SPI relies on session protocols.
Telephony Interface Architecture
This diagram shows the architecture of Cisco router Telephony building blocks and how they interact with each other.
This list describes the functions and definitions of the main diagram components:
Call Control Application Programming Interface (CCAPI)—Software entity that establishes, terminates and bridges call legs.
Voice Telephony Service Provider (VTSP)—An Cisco IOS process that services requests from the Call Control API and formulates the appropriate requests to the digital signal processor (DSP) or the VPM.
Voice Processor Module (VPM)—The VPM is in charge of bridging and coordinating signaling processes between the Telephony ports signaling state machine (SSM), the DSP Resource Manager, and the VTSP.
DSP Resource Manager—The DSPRM provides interfaces by which the VTSP can send and receive messages to and from the DSPs.
Packet Handler—The packet handler forwards packets between the DSPs and the Peer Call legs.
Call Peer—The Call Peer is the opposite call leg. This can be another Telephony voice connection (POTS), VoFR, VoATM, or a VoIP connection.
Verify Digital and Analog Signaling (POTS Call-Leg)
Verifying digital and analog signaling is to:
Determine that the proper on-hook and off-hook analog or digital signaling is received.
Determine that proper E&M, FXO and FXS signaling is configured on both the router and switch (CO or PBX).
Verify that the DSPs are in digit collection mode.
The commands outlined in these sections can be used to verify the signaling.
show controllers T1 / E1 (digital)
show controllers t1 [slot/port]—Use this command first. It shows if the digital T1 connection between the router and switch (CO or PBX) is up or down and if it functions properly. The output of this command looks like this:
router# show controllers T1 1/0
T1 1/0 is up.
Applique type is Channelized T1
Cablelength is short 133
No alarms detected.
Framing is ESF, Line Code is B8ZS, Clock Source is Line
Primary.
Data in current interval (6 seconds elapsed):

 0 Line Code Violations, 0 Path Code Violations
 0 Slip Secs, 0 Fr Loss Secs, 0 Line Err Secs, 
  0 Degraded Mins
 0 Errored Secs, 0 Bursty Err Secs, 0 Severely Err Secs,
  0 Unavail Secs
If you use E1 use the show controllers e1 command. For more information, refer to:
T1 Layer 1 Troubleshooting
T1 Troubleshooting Flowchart
Troubleshooting Serial Line Problems
show voice port
show voice portslot-number/port—Use this command to display the port state and the parameters configured on the voice-port of Cisco voice interface cards (VIC). Like all Cisco IOS commands, defaults do not display in  show running-config , but they do display with this command.
This is sample output for an E&M voice port:

debug vpm (voice processor module)
These commands are used to debug the VPM Telephony interface:
debug vpm signal —This command is used to collect debug information for signaling events and can be useful to resolve problems with signaling to a PBX.
debug vpm spi —This command traces how the voice port module service provider interface (SPI) interfaces with the call control API. This  debug  command displays information about how each network indication and application request is handled.
debug vpm dsp —This command displays messages from the DSP on the VPM to the router and can be useful if you suspect the VPM is not functional. It is a simple way to check if the VPM responds to off-hook indications and to evaluate timing for signaling messages from the interface.
debug vpm all —This EXEC command enables all of the debug vpm commands: debug vpm spi,  debug vpm signal,  and  debug vpm dsp.
debug vpm port —Use this command to limit the debug output to a particular port. For example, this output shows debug vpm dspmessages only for port 1/0/0:
debug vpm dsp 

debug vpm port 1/0/0

If the on-hook and off-hook are not signaling properly, check these items:
Verify the cabling is correct.
Verify that both the router and switch (CO or PBX) are properly grounded.
Verify that both ends of the connection have equivalent signaling configurations. Mismatched configurations can cause incomplete or one-way signaling.

Verify Digits Received and Sent (POTS Call-Leg)
Once the on-hook and off-hook signaling are verified and work correctly, verify the correct digits are received or sent on the voice-port (digital or analog). A dial-peer is not matched or the switch (CO or PBX) is not able to ring the correct station if incomplete or incorrect digits are sent or received. Some commands that can be used to verify the digits received/sent are:
show dialplan number —This command is used to show which dial peer is reached when a particular telephone number is dialed.
debug vtsp session —This command displays information on how each network indication and application request is processed, signaling indications, and DSP control messages.
debug vtsp dsp —Earlier than Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3, this command displays the digits as they are received by the voice-port. However, in Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3 and later, the output of the debug  command no longer displays the digits. The combination of  debug hpi detail  and debug hpinotification can be used to see the incoming digits.
debug vtsp all —This command enables these debug voice telephony service provider (VTSP) commands:  debug vtsp session,  debug vtsp error ,  anddebug vtsp dsp.
show dialplan number
show dialplan number <digit_string>—This command displays the dial-peer that is matched by a string of digits. If multiple dial-peers can be matched, they are all shown in the order in which they are matched.
Note: You need to use the # sign at the end of phone numbers for dial-peers with variable length in order to match on destination-patterns that end with T.
The output of this command looks like this:
maui-voip-austin#show dialplan number 5000
Dial string terminator: #
Macro Exp.: 5000

debug vtsp session
The debug vtsp session  command shows information on how the router interacts with the DSP based on the signaling indications from the signaling stack and requests from the application. This  debug  command displays information about how each network indication and application request is handled, signaling indications, and DSP control messages.

If it is determined the digits are not sent or received properly, then it can possibly be necessary to use either a digit-grabber (test tool) or T1 tester to verify the digits are sent at the correct frequency and timing interval. If they are sent "incorrectly" for the switch (CO or PBX), some values on the router or switch (CO or PBX) can possibly need to be adjusted so that they match and can inter operate. These are usually digit duration and inter-digit duration values. Another item to examine if the digits appear to be sent correctly are any number translation tables in the switch (CO or PBX) that can add or remove digits.
Verify End-to-End VoIP Signaling (VOIP Call-Leg)
After you verify that voice-port signaling works properly and the correct digits are received, move to the VoIP call control troubleshooting and debugging. These factors explain why call control debugging can become a complex job:
Cisco VoIP gateways use H.323 signaling to complete calls. H.323 is made up of three layers of call-negotiation and call-establishment: H.225, H.245, and H.323. These protocols use a combination of TCP and UDP to set up and establish a call.
End-to-End VoIP debugging shows a number of Cisco IOS state-machines. Problems with any state-machine can cause a call to fail.
End-to-End VoIP debugging can be very verbose and create a lot of debug output.
debug voip ccapi inout
The primary command to debug end-to-end VoIP calls is  debug voip ccapi inout . The output from a call debug is shown in this output.
!--- Action: A VoIP call is originated through the 
!--- Telephony SPI (pots leg) to extension 5000.

If the call fails and the cause appears to be in the VoIP portion of the call setup, you can possibly need to look at the H.225 or H.245 TCP part of the call setup, as opposed to just the UDP portion of the H.323 setup. The commands that can be used to debug the H.225 or H.245 call setup are:
debug ip tcp transactions  and debug ip tcp packet—These commands examine the TCP portion of the H.225 and H.245 negotiation. They return the IP addresses, TCP ports, and states of the TCP connections.
debug cch323 h225 —This command examines the H.225 portion of the call negotiation and traces the state transition of the H.225 state machine based on the processed event. Think of this as the Layer 1 part of the three part H.323 call setup.
debug cch323 h245 —This command examines the H.245 portion of the call negotiation and traces the state transition of the H.245 state machine based on the processed events. Think of this as the Layer 2 part of the three part H.323 call setup.
Understand VoIP Quality of Service (QoS) Issues
When VoIP calls are properly established, the next step is to verify that the voice quality is good. Although QoS troubleshooting is not covered in this document, these guidelines need to be considered to achieve good voice quality:
Understand how much bandwidth a VoIP call consumes with each codec. This includes Layer 2 and IP/UDP/RTP headers. For more information, refer to Modify Bandwidth Consumption Calculation for Voice Calls.
Understand the characteristics of the IP network the calls travels over. For example, the bandwidth of a frame-relay network at CIR is much different than that above-CIR (or burst), where packets can be dropped or queued in the Frame-Relay cloud. Ensure that delay and jitter are controlled and eliminated as much as possible. One-way transmit delay must not exceed 150 ms (per G.114 recommendation).
Use a queuingtechnique that allows VoIP traffic to be identified and prioritized.
When you transmit VoIP over low-speed links, use Layer 2 packet fragmentation techniques, such as MLPPP with Link Fragmentation and Interleaving (LFI) on point-to-point links, or FRF.12 on Frame-Relay links. Fragmentation of larger data packets allows less jitter and delay in transmitting VoIP traffic because the VoIP packets can be interleaved onto the link.
Try to use a different codec and try the call with VAD enabled and disabled to possibly narrow down the issue to the DSP, as opposed to the IP network.
With VoIP, the main things to look for when troubleshooting QoS issues are dropped packets and network bottlenecks that can cause delay and jitter.
Look for:
interface drops
buffer drops
interface congestion
link congestion
Each interface in the path of the VoIP call needs to be examined. Also, eliminate drops and congestion. Also, round-trip delay needs to be reduced as much as possible. Pings between the VoIP end points give an indication of the round trip delay of a link. The round trip delay must not exceed 300 ms whenever possible. If the delay does have to exceed this value, efforts need to be taken to ensure this delay is constant, so as not to introduce jitter or variable delay.
Verification must also be made to ensure the Cisco IOS queuing mechanism places the VoIP packets within the proper queues. Cisco IOS commands, such as  show queue interface or   show priority  can assist in verification of queuing.

Call Disconnection Cause Value (in Hex) Meaning and Number (in Decimal)
CC_CAUSE_UANUM = 0x1 unassigned number. (1)
CC_CAUSE_NO_ROUTE = 0x3 no route to destination. (3)
CC_CAUSE_NORM = 0x10 normal call clearing. (16)
CC_CAUSE_BUSY = 0x11 user busy. (17)
CC_CAUSE_NORS = 0x12 no user response. (18)
CC_CAUSE_NOAN = 0x13 no user answer. (19)
CC_CAUSE_REJECT = 0x15 call rejected. (21)
CC_CAUSE_INVALID_NUMBER = 0x1C invalid number. (28)
CC_CAUSE_UNSP = 0x1F normal, unspecified. (31)
CC_CAUSE_NO_CIRCUIT = 0x22 no circuit. (34)
CC_CAUSE_NO_REQ_CIRCUIT = 0x2C no requested circuit. (44)
CC_CAUSE_NO_RESOURCE = 0x2F no resource. (47)1
CC_CAUSE_NOSV = 0x3F service or option not available, or Unspecified. (63)
1This issue can occur due to a codec mismatch within the H323 setup, so the first troubleshooting step is to hard code the VoIP dial-peers to use the correct codec.
