Introduction
This document describes how to configure Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) and use Lightweight Directory Access Protocol  (LDAP) objects attributes to authenticate and authorize devices dynamically.
Note: This document is valid for setups that use LDAP as the external identity source for the ISE authentication and authorization.

Edited by Neri Cruz Cisco TAC engineer.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of the following topics:
Basic knowledge of ISE policy sets, authentication, and authorization policies
Mac Authentication Bypass (MAB)
Basic knowledge of Radius protocol
Basic knowledge of Windows server
Components Used
The information on this document is based on the following software and hardware versions:
Cisco ISE, Version 2.4 patch 11
Microsoft Windows Server, Version 2012 R2 x64
Cisco Switch Catalyst 3650-24PD, Version 03.07.05.E (15.2(3)E5)
Microsoft Windows 7 machine
Note: The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Configuration
This section describes how to configure the network devices, the integration between ISE and LDAP, and finally to configure LDAP attributes to be used in ISE Authorization Policy.
Network Diagram
This image illustrates the network topology that is used:
Here is the traffic flow, as illustrated in the network diagram:
The user connects its pc/laptop to the designated switch port.
The switch sends a Radius Access-Request for that user to the ISE
When the ISE receives the information it queries the LDAP server for the specific user filed, which contains the attributes to be used in the authorization policy conditions.
 Once the ISE receives the attributes (the switch port, switch name, and device mac address) it compares the information provided by the switch.
If the attributes information provided by the switch are the same that those provided by LDAP, the ISE will send a RADIUS Access-Accept with the permissions configured on the authorization profile.
Configurations
Use this section in order to configure the LDAP, switch and the ISE.
Configure LDAP
Complete the following steps to configure the LDAP server:
1. Navigate to Server Manager > Dashboard > Tools > ADSI Edit
 2. Right-click on the ADSI Edit icon and select Connect to...
 3. Under connection settings define a name and select the OK button to start the connection.
 4. Under the same ADSI Edit menu right-click in DC connection (DC=ciscodemo, DC=lab), select New, then select option Object
 5. Select option OrganizationalUnit as the new Object and select next.
  6. Define a name for the new OrganizationalUnit and select Next  
 7. Select Finish in order to create the new OrganizationalUnit
 8. Right-click on the OrganizationalUnit that was just created and select New > Object
  9.Select device as object class and select next
    10.Define a name in the Value field and select Next
     11. Select the option More Attributes
  11. For the drop-down menu, Select a property to view, select option macAddress, then define the endpoint Mac address that will be authenticated under the Edit attribute field and select the Add button to save the device mac address.
Note: Use a double colon instead of dots or hyphen between mac address octets.
  12. Select OK in order to save the information and continue with device object configuration   
  13. Select Finish in order to create the new device Object
  14. Right-click on the device object and select option Properties
  15. Select option description and select Edit in order to define the switch name and switch-port where the device will be connected.     
16. Define the switch name and switch-port, please make sure you use a comma to separate each value. Select Add and then Ok to save the information.
  Switchapflexconnect is the switch name.
GigabitEthernet1/0/6 is the switch-port where the endpoint is connected to.
Note: It is possible to use scripts in order to add attributes to a specific field, however, for this example we are defining the values manually
Note: AD-attribute is case sensitive, if you use all Mac addresses in lower case ISE converts to upper case during the LDAP query. In order to avoid this behavior, Disable Process Host Lookup under allowed protocols.

Note: Global and interface configuration may need to be adjusted in your environment
ISE Configuration
The following describes the configuration on ISE to get the attributes from the LDAP server and to configure the ISE policies.
On ISE, go to Administration->Identity Management->External Identity Sources and select the LDAP  folder and click on Add in order to create a new connection with LDAP

2.Under General tab define a name and select the mac address as the Subject Name Attribute
 3. Under Connection tab configure the IP addres, admin DN, and password from the LDAP server to get a successful connection.
   Note: Port 389 is the default port used.
  4. Under Attributes tab select the the macAddress and description attributes, these attributes will be used in the authorization policy
     5. In order to create an allowed protocol permitted go to Policy->Policy Elements->Results->Authentication->Allowed Protocols. Define and select Process Host Lookup and Allow PAP/ASCII as the only allowed protocols. Finally select Save
  6. In order to create an authorization profile, go to Policy->Policy Elements->Results->Authorization->Authorization Profiles. Select Add and define the permissions will be assigned to the endpoint.
 
7.Go to Policy-> Policy Set and create a policy set using the predefined condition Wired_MAB and the Allowed Protocol created in step 5.
8.Under the new Policy set created create an authentication policy using the predefined Wired_MAB Library and LDAP connection as external identity source sequence
 9. Under Authorization Policy define a name and create a compound condition using LDAP Attribute description, Radius NAS-Port-Id and NetworkDeviceName. Finally, add the Authorization profile created in step 6.
After you apply the configuration, you should be able to connect to the network without user intervention.
Verify
Once connected to the designated switch-port you can type show authentication session interface GigabitEthernet X/X/X details to validate the authentication and authorization status of the device.

On ISE you can use Radius Live Logs for confirmation.
Troubleshoot
On the LDAP server, Validate that the device created has Mac address, proper switch name, and switch-port configured
On ISE, you can take a packet capture (Go to Operations->Troubleshoot->Diagnostic Tool->TCP Dumps) in order to validate the values are being sent from LDAP to ISE
