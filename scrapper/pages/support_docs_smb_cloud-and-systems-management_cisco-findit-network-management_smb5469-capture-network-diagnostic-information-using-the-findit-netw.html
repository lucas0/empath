Objective
The Cisco FindIT Network Management provides tools that help you easily monitor, manage, and configure your Cisco 100 to 500 Series network devices such as switches, routers, and wireless access points (WAPs) using your web browser. It also notifies you about device and Cisco Support notifications such as the availability of new firmware, device status, network settings updates, and any connected devices that are no longer under warranty or covered by a support contract.
The FindIT Network Management is a distributed application which is comprised of two separate components or interfaces: one or more Probes referred to as FindIT Network Probe and a single Manager called FindIT Network Manager.
The FindIT Network Probe is equipped with a Troubleshooting page that provide a tool to help diagnose problems in the network. The Network Show Tech allows you to easily capture diagnostic information for your network and send it to a support engineer for analysis, or save to your local computer for your personal analyzation.
This article provides instructions on how to capture diagnostic information using the FindIT Network Probe.
