It provides a DWDM line system that is optimized for data center environments and is optimized for point-to-point applications at maximum capacity. Cisco NCS 1001 supports up to three optical modules. The modules can be amplifiers, OTDR, or protection switching modules.
NCS 1001 has the following components:
Four removable fans.
Two removable AC or DC power supply modules (PSU).
Three slots for optical modules. The Optical Amplifier Module ( NCS1K-EDFA), Protection Switching Module (NCS1K-PSM), and Optical Time Domain Reflectometer Module (NCS1K-OTDR) can be inserted in these slots.
