Systems Information defined
Systems Information (SI) is a combination of data that we receive from our solutions and data collection tools, and information you provide to us about the solutions, including those that are installed in your network. SI is needed to deliver, support, and improve our solutions and services.
Guiding principles
As trusted stewards of your data, we hold ourselves and our partners to the following guiding principles:
Transparency
We clearly explain how we use your data and only use it for that stated purpose.
Trusted Ecosystem
Systems Information that can be attributable to you is only shared within our trusted ecosystem, meaning the partners, distributors and contractors who help provide our solutions to you and who are also committed to protecting that data.
Accountability
We hold ourselves and our partners accountable for adhering to the highest standards when it comes to collecting, using, sharing, storing, securing, accessing, transferring, or otherwise processing your data.
