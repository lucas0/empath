Introduction
This document describes the set-up of an EtherChannel and 802.1Q trunking between Catalyst 2950 and Catalyst 2948G-L3 switches. EtherChannel can be called Fast EtherChannel (FEC) or Gigabit EtherChannel (GEC) depending upon the speed of the interfaces or ports used to form the EtherChannel.
Note: The Catalyst 2950 switch supports only 802.1Q trunking, and does not support Inter-Switch Link Protocol (ISL) trunking. Catalyst 2948G-L3 and Catalyst 4908G-L3 switches share the same software image, so the Catalyst 2948G-L3 configuration used in this document also applies to the Catalyst 4908G-L3 switch.
In this configuration example, two Fast Ethernet interfaces on a Catalyst 2950 switch are bundled into a FEC with two Fast Ethernet interfaces from a Catalyst 2948G-L3 switch. FEC, GEC, port channel, and channel group refers to EtherChannel in this document.

Components Used
The information in this document is based on the software and hardware versions below.
Catalyst 2948G-L3 switch running Cisco IOSÂ® Software 12.0(14)W5(20)
Catalyst 2950 switch running Cisco IOS Software 12.1(12c)EA1
The information presented in this document was created from devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If you are working in a live network, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command before using it.
Background Theory
From a configuration standpoint, the Catalyst 2948G-L3 switch is a router. It uses a Cisco IOS command line and by default, all interfaces are routed interfaces.
The Catalyst 2948G-L3 switch does not extend your VLANs by default. Since all of the interfaces are routed interfaces, each interface has to belong to a different network or subnet. If you want two or more interfaces to belong to the same subnet, bridging needs to be configured on these interfaces.
The Catalyst 2948G-L3 switch does not support negotiation protocols found on other Catalyst switches, such as VLAN Trunk Protocol (VTP), Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP), and Port Aggression Protocol (PAgP). It is recommended that these protocols be turned off on the Catalyst 2950 interfaces that connect to the Catalyst 2948G-L3 switch.
On the Catalyst 2948G-L3 switch, all traffic received on the native VLAN on a trunk is routed in software. This means this traffic is sent to the CPU. When a great deal of traffic is sent on this VLAN, it can result in a high CPU load on the Catalyst 2948G-L3 switch and have an adverse effect on the performance of the network. It is advised to create a dummy VLAN (such as VLAN 99) which can be made the native VLAN for the trunk. All of the user traffic is sent over the other VLANs and these are routed in hardware, leading to a better performance.
Configure
In this section, you are presented with the information to configure the features described in this document.
Note: To find additional information on the commands used in this document, use the Command Lookup Tool (registered customers only) .
Creating a Port Channel
When configuring the EtherChannel, it is recommended you create a port channel by following the steps below. This will avoid possible problems with Spanning-Tree Protocol (STP) during the configuration process. An STP loop can occur if one side is configured as a channel before the other side is configured as a channel. As a result, the switch can put the interfaces involved in the loop in Errordisabled status.The following steps are guidelines for this specific configuration scenario.
On the Catalyst 2948G-L3 switch:
Configure the interfaces to be used in port channeling in administratively shut down mode.
Create the port channel (channel group). The port channel carries different VLANs, so create a subinterface for each VLAN that is present on the trunk. On a 802.1Q trunk, all of the packets going over the trunk are tagged except the traffic on the native VLAN. Because of this, you need to distinguish the subinterface corresponding to the native VLAN by putting the keyword "native" at the end. As mentioned before, it is best to use a dummy VLAN that has no user traffic.
The Catalyst 2948G-L3 switch has by default all routed ports. For the ports in 2948G-L3 to able to communicate on different VLANs on the 2950, you have to implement bridging. Interfaces (and subinterfaces) that belong to the same VLAN (network or subnet) have to be configured to belong to the same bridge group. To route between these different bridge groups, Integrated Routing and Bridging (IRB) must be enabled.
On the Catalyst 2950 switch:
Configure the interfaces that will belong to the channel as a trunk and make sure the DTP is turned off. This is done by issuing the switchport nonegotiate command on the physical interfaces. Configure a dummy VLAN (VLAN 99 in this example) on the VLAN database that will be used as the native VLAN on the trunk. Unless otherwise specified, the native VLAN on a 802.1Q trunk is VLAN 1. You need to specify on both interfaces that you are using VLAN 99 as the native VLAN. This is done by issuing the switchport trunk native vlan 99 command.
Create the port channel and be sure to set the channel mode to on (this turns off PAgP).
Reenable the interfaces that were disabled earlier on the Catalyst 2948G-L3 switch by issuing the no shut command.
