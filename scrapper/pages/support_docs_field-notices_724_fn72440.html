Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCwc40775 OCIC subscriptions - UserID should take priority over BLF URI
Problem Description
After patch AP382053 is applied, the Xtended Services Interface (XSI) subscriptions could be rejected.
Background
After patch AP382053 is applied and the Enhanced XSI Mechanism is activated, the Open Client Interface-Call Control (OCI-C) subscription could be rejected with this response:
Unauthorized request oci:errorCode 100004
Problem Symptom
When patch AP382053 is applied and the new feature, Enhanced XSI Mechanism is activated (Feature ID 101642), these two problems can occur:
A ClassCastException can occur and this signature can be seen in the logs:
java.lang.ClassCastException:
com.broadsoft.protocols.ocic.OCICEventsUtilityDb$GetAdminUserIdByUIDQuery cannot be cast to
com.broadsoft.protocols.ocic.OCICEventsUtilityDb$GetUserFromBlfUriQuery
If the Busy Lamp Field (BLF) Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) uses the same URI as an existing user, the OCI-C subscription could be rejected with oci:ErrorResponse (Unauthorized request oci:errorCode 100004).
