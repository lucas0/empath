The Cisco® Fourth-Generation Long-Term Evolution (LTE) Advanced Network Interface Modules (NIMs) for Cisco 4000 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISRs) and ENCS 5400 Series provide the next generation of wireless WAN primary, backhaul, IWAN, and backup solutions.
Product Overview
LTE Advanced can provide either primary connectivity or backup communications, offering network resiliency for business continuity. With greater agility and speed to deployment than wired solutions, LTE Advanced can reduce network cost and complement wire-line public and private network access. Practical applications of LTE Advanced for organizations include parallel networks, primary connection, failover, in-vehicle connectivity, network convergence, and last-mile diversity. The LTE Advanced NIMs with the Cisco 4000 Series ISRs and ENCS 5400 Series lead the industry in bringing enterprise-grade functions such as quality of service (QoS), Multi-Virtual Route Forwarding (Multi-VRF), advanced VPN, and unified communications solutions over LTE.
The Cisco LTE Advanced NIMs (Figure 1) provide an enterprise-class, multimode LTE Advanced wireless WAN (WWAN) solution. With Cisco ISRs, LTE Advanced is a powerful primary WAN access solution. Businesses can now run applications such as interactive video and telepresence on a primary LTE Advanced connection that is up to 150 times faster than 3G links, with far lower latency. These LTE Advanced modules support the latest Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 10 Category 6 LTE Advanced standards. Cisco multimode LTE Advanced WWAN NIMs provide persistent, reliable LTE Advanced connectivity, with fallback and transparent handoff to earlier technologies. The cards provide bandwidth to support high-definition (HD) and peer-to-peer (P2P) video calls, providing customers with an excellent mobile broadband experience. The Cisco LTE Advanced WWAN NIMs are tightly integrated with the services provided on the award-winning Cisco 4000 Series ISRs and ECS 5400 Series, which deliver highly secure data, voice, video, NFVs, and mobility services. The Cisco LTE Advanced WWAN NIMs are supported on the modular Cisco 4200, 4300, and 4400 Series ISRs and ENCS 5400 Series with Network Function Virtualization and services.
Enterprises are looking for ways to reduce deployment time, enable comprehensive media services, increase revenue, and improve business continuity. The Cisco LTE Advanced WWAN NIMs, when coupled with a service provider’s wireless data plan, provide a rapidly deployable, high-bandwidth, reliable, and secure solution for branch offices and remote sites. With LTE Advanced fast data rates, these NIMs offer a primary WAN link solution capable of running comprehensive branch-office services, including voice and video services.
Carrier aggregation makes it possible for carriers to transmit data to a device like a wireless router over multiple network bands at once, through a single “aggregated data pipe.” LTE Advanced with carrier aggregation utilizes multiple frequency bands at once, devices switch frequency bands in just a few milliseconds. Additionally, even if one band drops, the device stays connected via the second band in the aggregated data pipe.
  The Cisco LTE Advanced 3.0 WWAN NIMs include the following models:

With enhanced data rates and improved latency, WWAN services are an ideal way to replace or supplement traditional wire-line services. LTE Advanced WWAN data services offered today have theoretical limits of CAT6 300 Mbps on the downlink and 50 Mbps on the uplink. The actual data speed depends on the service provider’s network. LTE Advanced WWAN data services are an alternative in areas where broadband services are either not available or very expensive. Cisco is building on these performance milestones and adding support for wireless to our wide variety of WAN interface alternatives.
Main Business Benefits
●   Primary connectivity: The Cisco multimode LTE Advanced WWAN NIM provides persistent, reliable LTE Advanced connectivity with fallback and transparent handoff to earlier technologies. It enables high-performance, secure, reliable, and transparent multimedia applications anywhere and anytime and allows customers to deploy and manage the same device for multiple applications, simplifying deployment and management. For businesses requiring rapid setup or temporary connectivity, LTE Advanced WWAN offers the capability to deploy a new site quickly. Using the integrated services available on the Cisco ISRs, Cisco LTE Advanced WWAN NIMs can provide instant mobile communications during disasters and service outages.
●   WAN backup: Resilient WAN access is a crucial requirement for branch offices connecting to a corporate site or the Internet. Although DSL, Frame Relay, ISDN, and dialup are common choices for backup if a primary WAN link fails, a nonterrestrial data path such as an LTE Advanced WWAN provides enhanced WAN diversity (Figures 2 and 3). Cisco LTE Advanced WWAN NIMs, combined with the Cisco ISRs, offer the capability to automatically initiate connection over the LTE Advanced WWAN when the primary WAN link is unavailable. In addition, you can use Cisco LTE Advanced WWAN NIMs to provide supplemental bandwidth when the primary WAN link is overloaded (Figure 4).

  Main Features and Benefits
●   Integrated LTE Advanced WWAN broadband: With the LTE Advanced WWAN modem integrated into the router, you gain the benefits of simplified installation and management. In addition, the Cisco LTE Advanced WWAN NIMs are tightly integrated with Cisco ISRs and ENCS, which run the industry-leading Cisco IOS® XE Software, giving access to all the advanced features of Cisco IOS Software, such as QoS, intelligent network queuing, and robust security.
●   Performance: With increasing data use and the proliferation of web-based applications at remote sites, there is an increasing need for high-speed (broadband) data connections to run mission-critical applications at these sites. LTE Advanced WWAN services promise low-latency links at high speeds.
●   Short installation time: Businesses sometimes have to wait weeks or months to get data circuits installed at new locations. For temporary or seasonal sites, wireless data services allow instant connectivity anywhere there is cellular coverage, and rapid deployment allows you to quickly set up networks with WAN connectivity.
●   Network resiliency through WAN diversity: WAN connectivity is crucial to the functioning of your business, and any downtime means a loss of productivity and lost opportunity. Staying connected and operational during a network outage can be vital. A wireless connection for backup to a remote site provides protection against line outages and an additional level of redundancy, because the LTE Advanced WWAN infrastructure is often served by separate facilities, providing redundancy for the entire local loop. With LTE Advanced WWAN, Cisco Intelligent WAN (IWAN) provides transport-independent intelligent path control, application optimization, and secure connectivity on any device, over any connection, and to any cloud.
●   Portability: You can easily relocate wireless routers and Cisco LTE Advanced WWAN NIMs wherever coverage is available.
●   Multiple packet data networks (PDNs): Configure multiple active access-point names (APNs) so that Internet traffic can be kept separate from the corporate traffic.
Entrerprise-Grade WAN Features for LTE Advanced
LTE Advanced multiple-bearer QoS for cellular (Figure 5): The LTE Advanced NIM supports LTE Advanced multiple-bearer QoS. Detailed information about the bearer is part of the command-line interface (CLI) show command output, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) MIBs, etc. The QoS feature is service provider-dependent, and requires the service provider to launch this service.
Figure 5.      LTE Advanced Multiple-Bearer QoS
●   Multi-VRF for cellular: LTE Advanced NIMs now support Multi-VRF for cellular networks (Figure 6). Multi-VRF is a Cisco proprietary implementation in addition to the 3GPP specification and requires a Cisco ASR 5000 Packet Gateway (P-GW) as the headend at the service provider’s network. The Multi-VRF feature is service provider-dependent, and requires the service provider to launch this service.

●   Enterprise-grade unified communications solutions over LTE Advanced: The LTE Advanced NIM supports voice and video and can be integrated with Cisco Unified Communications cloud or premises-based infrastructure.
●   Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) search: User equipment (UE) presents the end user with available PLMN search manually. UE can optimize the PLMN search procedure using stored information such as RF carriers and cell parameters.
