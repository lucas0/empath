Agent Teams and Supervisors
This chapter provides information about agent teams and supervisors.
Agent Team Reports
Supervisors can report on the agents in teams that they supervise to monitor the performance of a particular team.
Teams are peripheral-specific. All agents on a team and the supervisors for the team must reside on the same peripheral. An individual agent can be assigned to one team only.
Supervisors are a special type of agents who were configured in the Configuration Manager with limited reporting privileges to see information in the agent report categories, and within those categories, to see data for only those agents on teams that they supervise.
You can select 0 or 1 primary supervisor for an agent team, and you can select multiple secondary supervisors for each team. Each supervisor can be a supervisor for multiple teams.

Note
To use agent team reports, configure teams and supervisors in Configuration Manager. The team structure you choose is up to you. You can use your ACD configuration. You can also use your ACD reports to monitor agent teams.
Supervisor Activity
Agent team supervisors can take advantage of supervisory features available on their desktops. Use reports to see when supervisors had to use the Barge-In and Intercept features.

Note
These supervisory features are not available to agents using MRDs other than Voice.
Barge-In (Webex CCE)
Intercept (Webex CCE)
Reports That Show Information on Agent Teams
Barge-In (Webex CCE)
When the supervisor activates the Barge-In desktop feature, the agent's desktop completes a conference to the supervisor so that the supervisor can join into the conversation with the call. The following fields increment for both the agent and the supervisor in the agent skill group and skill group tables.

Note
If you deployed Webex CCE as the VRU, data is not gathered for Barge-In.
Table 1. Supervisor Barge-In
Fields incremented for agent's skill group to which the call was routed
Fields incremented for supervisor's default skill group
CallsHandled, InternalCalls, BargeInCalls
BargeInCalls, InternalCallsRcvd
For the agent, the call is reported in Tasks Handled and Barge-In report fields. For the supervisor, the call is reported in Tasks Handled and Barge-In report fields.
Intercept (Webex CCE)
If the supervisor decides to intercept (take over) the call, the supervisor activates the Intercept desktop button. This interception drops the agent out of the conference, which allows the supervisor to take over the call. The following fields are incremented during the intercept operation for both the agent skill group and skill group tables.

Note
If you have deployed Webex CCE as the VRU, data is not gathered for Intercept.
