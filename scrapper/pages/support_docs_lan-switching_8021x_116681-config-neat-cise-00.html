Introduction
This document describes the configuration and behavior of Network Edge Authentication Topology (NEAT) in a simple scenario. NEAT utilizes the Client Information Signalling Protocol (CISP) in order to propagate client MAC addresses and VLAN information between supplicant and authenticator switches.
In this configuration example, both the authenticator switch (also called the authenticator) and supplicant switch (also called the supplicant) perform 802.1x authentication; the authenticator authenticates the supplicant, which, in turn, authenticates the testing PC.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of the IEEE 802.1x authentication standard.
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
Two Cisco Catalyst 3560 Series switches with Cisco IOSÂ® Software, Release 12.2(55)SE8; one switch acts as an authenticator, and the other acts as a supplicant.
Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE), Release 1.2.
PC with Microsoft Windows XP, Service Pack 3.
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Configure
This example covers sample configurations for the:
Authenticator switch
Supplicant switch
Cisco ISE
The configurations are the minimum needed in order to perfom this lab exercise; they might not be optimal for or fulfill other needs.
Note: Use the Command Lookup Tool (registered customers only) in order to obtain more information on the commands used in this section.
Network Diagram
This network diagram illustrates the connectivity used in this example. Black lines indicate logical or physical connectivity, and green lines indicate links authenticated through the use of 802.1x.
Authenticator Switch Configuration
The authenticator contains the basic elements needed for dot1x. In this example, commands that are specific to NEAT or CISP are bolded.
This is the basic authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) configuration:
aaa new-model
aaa authentication dot1x default group radius
aaa authorization network default group radius
aaa accounting dot1x default start-stop group radius

radius-server host 10.48.66.107 auth-port 1812 acct-port 1813  key cisco

! Enable authenticator switch to authenticate the supplicant switch.
dot1x system-auth-control
! Enable CISP framework.
cisp enable

! configure uplink port as access and dot1x authentication. 
interface FastEthernet0/6
 switchport mode access
 authentication port-control auto
 dot1x pae authenticator
 spanning-tree portfast
CISP is enabled globally, and the interconnecting port is configured in authenticator and access mode.
Supplicant Switch Configuration
Accurate supplicant configuration is crucial for the entire setup to work as expected. This example configuration contains a typical AAA and dot1x configuration.
This is the basic AAA configuration:
aaa new-model
aaa authentication dot1x default group radius
aaa authorization network default group radius
aaa accounting dot1x default start-stop group radius

radius-server host 10.48.66.107 auth-port 1812 acct-port 1813 key cisco

! Enable supplicant switch to authenticate devices connected
dot1x system-auth-control

! Forces the switch to send only multicast EAPOL packets when it receives either 
   unicast or multicast packets, which allows NEAT to work on the supplicant 
   switch in all host modes.
dot1x supplicant force-multicast

! Enable CISP framework operation. 
cisp enable
The supplicant should have configured credentials and should supply an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) method to be used.
The supplicant can use EAP-Message Digest 5 (MD5) and EAP-Flexible Authentication via Secure Protocol (FAST) (among other EAP types) for authentication in case of CISP. In order to keep the ISE configuration to a minimum, this example uses EAP-MD5 for authentication of the supplicant to the authenticator. (The default would force use of EAP-FAST, which requires Protected Access Credential [PAC] provisioning; this document does not cover that scenario.)
! configure EAP mode used by supplicant switch to authenticate itself to 
   authenticator switch eap profile EAP_PRO
 method md5

! Configure credentials use by supplicant switch during that authentication. 
dot1x credentials CRED_PRO
 username bsnsswitch
 password 0 C1sco123
The connection of the supplicant to the authenticator is already configured to be a trunk port (in contrast to access port configuration on the authenticator). At this stage, this is expected; configuration will dynamically change when the ISE returns the correct attribute.
interface FastEthernet0/6
 switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
 switchport mode trunk
 dot1x pae supplicant
 dot1x credentials CRED_PRO
 dot1x supplicant eap profile EAP_PRO
The port that connects to the Windows PC has a minimal configuration and is shown here for reference only.
interface FastEthernet0/5
 switchport access vlan 200
 switchport mode access
 authentication port-control auto
 dot1x pae authenticator
ISE Configuration
This procedure describes how to set up a basic ISE configuration.
Enable the required authentication protocols.

In this example, wired dot1x allows EAP-MD5 to authenticate the supplicant to the authenticator and allows Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP)-Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol Version 2 (MSCHAPv2) to authenticate the Windows PC to the supplicant.

Navigate to Policy > Results > Authentication > Allowed protocols, select the protocol service list used by wired dot1x, and ensure the protocols in this step are enabled.



Create an authorization policy. Navigate to Policy > Results > Authorization > Authorization Policy, and create or update a policy so it contains NEAT as a returned attribute. This is an example of such a policy:



When the NEAT option is turned on, the ISE returns device-traffic-class=switch as part of authorization. This option is necessary in order to change the port mode of the authenticator from access to trunk.

Create an authorization rule to use this profile. Navigate to Policy > Authorization, and create or update a rule.

In this example, a special device group called Authenticator_switches is created, and all supplicants send a username that begins with bsnsswitch.



Add the switches to the appropriate group. Navigate to Administration > Network Resources > Network Devices, and click Add.



In this example, BSTP-3500-1 (the authenticator) is part of Authenticator_switches group; BSTP-3500-2 (the supplicant) does not need to be part of this group.
Verify
Use this section to confirm that your configuration works properly. This section describes two behaviors:
Authentication between switches
Authentication between the Windows PC and the supplicant
It also explains three additional situations:
Removal of an authenticated client from the network
Removal of a supplicant
Ports without dot1x on a supplicant
Notes:

The Output Interpreter Tool (registered customers only) supports certain show commands. Use the Output Interpreter Tool in order to view an analysis of show command output.

Refer to Important Information on Debug Commands before you use debug commands.
Supplicant Switch Authentication to Authenticator Switch
In this example, the supplicant authenticates to the authenticator. The steps in the process are:
The supplicant is configured and plugged into port fastethernet0/6. The dot1x exchange causes the supplicant to use EAP in order to send a pre-configured username and password to the authenticator.
The authenticator performs a RADIUS exchange and provides credentials for ISE validation.
If the credentials are correct, the ISE returns attributes required by NEAT (device-traffic-class=switch), and the authenticator changes its switchport mode from access to trunk.
This example shows the exchange of CISP information between switches:

   Type:ADD_CLIENT
Once authentication and authorization succeed, the CISP exchange occurs. Each exchange has a REQUEST, which is sent by the supplicant, and a RESPONSE, which serves as a reply and acknowledgment from the authenticator.
Two distinct exchanges are performed: REGISTRATION and ADD_CLIENT. During the REGISTRATION exchange, the supplicant informs the authenticator that it is CISP-capable, and the authenticator then acknowledges this message. The ADD_CLIENT exchange is used to inform the authenticator about devices connected to the supplicant's local port. As with REGISTRATION, ADD-CLIENT is initiated on the supplicant and acknowledged by the authenticator.
Enter these show commands in order to verify the communication, roles, and addresses:
bstp-3500-1#show cisp clients

Interface(s) with CISP registered user(s):
------------------------------------------
 Fa0/6
 Auth Mgr (Authenticator)
In this example, the role of Authenticator is correctly assigned to the correct interface (fa0/6), and two MAC addresses are registered. The MAC addresses are the supplicant on port fa0/6 on VLAN1 and on VLAN200.
Verification of dot1x authentication sessions can now be performed. The fa0/6 port on the upstream switch is already authenticated. This is the dot1x exchange that is triggered when BSTP-3500-2 (the supplicant) is plugged in:
bstp-3500-1#show authentication sessions

Interface MAC Address Method Domain Status Session ID
Fa0/6 001b.0d55.2187 dot1x DATA Authz Success 0A3039E10000000700FB3259
As expected at this stage, there are no sessions on the supplicant:
bstp-3500-2#show authentication sessions
No Auth Manager contexts currently exist
Windows PC Authentication to Supplicant Switch
In this example, the Windows PC authenticates to the supplicant. The steps in the process are:
The Windows PC is plugged into FastEthernet 0/5 port on BSTP-3500-2 (the supplicant).
The supplicant performs authentication and authorization with the ISE.
The supplicant informs the authenticator that a new client is connected on the port.
This is the communication from the supplicant:

At the same time, the supplicant removes clients that represent the supplicant from the CISP table and deactivates CISP on that interface.
Ports Without dot1x on Supplicant Switch
CISP information that is propagated from the supplicant to the authenticator serves only as another layer of enforcement. The supplicant informs the authenticator about all of the allowed MAC addresses that are connected to it.
A scenario that is typically misunderstood is this: if a device is plugged on a port that does not have dot1x enabled, the MAC address is learned and propagated to the upstream switch through CISP.
The authenticator allows communication that comes from all clients learned through CISP.
In essence, it is the role of supplicant to restrict access of devices, through dot1x or other methods, and to propagate MAC address and VLAN information to the authenticator. The authenticator acts as an enforcer of information provided in those updates.
As an example, a new VLAN (VLAN300) was created on both switches, and a device was plugged into port fa0/4 on the supplicant. Port fa0/4 is a simple access port that is not configured for dot1x.
This output from the supplicant shows a new registered port:
bstp-3500-2#show cisp registrations

Interface(s) with CISP registered user(s):
------------------------------------------
 Fa0/4
 Fa0/5
 Auth Mgr (Authenticator)
 Fa0/6
 802.1x Sup (Supplicant)
On the authenticator, a new MAC address is visible on VLAN 300.
bstp-3500-1#show cisp clients

Authenticator Client Table:
---------------------------

Troubleshoot
This section provides information you can use to troubleshoot your configuration.
Note:

The Output Interpreter Tool (registered customers only) supports certain show commands. Use the Output Interpreter Tool in order to view an analysis of show command output.

Refer to Important Information on Debug Commands before you use debug commands.
These commands help you troubleshoot NEAT and CISP; this document includes examples for most of them:
debug cisp all - shows the exchange of CISP information between switches.
show cisp summary - displays a summary of the CISP interface status on the switch.
show cisp registrations - indicates the interfaces that participate in CISP exchanges, the roles of those interfaces, and whether the interfaces are part of NEAT.
show cisp clients - displays a table of known client MAC addresses and their location (VLAN and interface). This is useful mainly from the authenticator.
