Monitoring and Troubleshooting Service in Cisco ISE
The Monitoring and Troubleshooting (MnT) service is a comprehensive identity solution for all Cisco ISE run-time services. The Operations menu contains the following components, and can be viewed only from the primary Policy Administration Node (PAN). Note that the Operations menu does not appear in the primary Monitoring node.
Monitoring: Provides real-time presentation of meaningful data representing the state of access activities on a network. This insight allows you to easily interpret and monitor operational conditions.
Troubleshooting: Provides contextual guidance for resolving access issues on networks. You can then address user concerns and provide resolution in a timely manner.
Reporting: Provides a catalog of standard reports that you can use to analyze trends and monitor system performance and network activities. You can customize reports in various ways and save them for future use. You can search records using wild cards and multiple values in all the reports for the Identity, Endpoint ID, and ISE Node (except the Health Summary report) fields.

Health Check
Cisco ISE has an on-demand health check option to diagnose all the nodes in your Cisco ISE deployment. Running a health check on all the nodes before any operation helps to reduce the downtime and improve the overall functionality of Cisco ISE system by identifying critical issues, if any. Health Check provides the working status of a component and displays troubleshooting recommendations regarding issues, if any, in your deployment.
Table 1. Health Check Deployment
Deployment Type
Description
Platform Support Check
Checks the supported platforms in the deployment. A platform that does not meet the recommended requirement specification may cause performance issues.
Checks the 34xx and other unsupported platform details and checks if the system has a minimum of 12 core CPU, 300-GB hard disk, 16-GB memory.
Deployment Validation
Checks if the state-of-the-deployment node is in sync or in progres.
DNS Resolvability
Checks for the forward and reverse lookup of host name and IP address.
Both forward and reverse DNS resolutions are recommended for deployment Health Check to function properly.
Trust Store Certificate Validation
Checks if your Trust Store certificate is valid or has expired.
Delete or renew unused or expired certificates to ensure optimum Cisco ISE functionality.
System Certificate Validation
Checks the system certificate validation for each node.
Delete or renew unused or expired certificates to ensure optimum Cisco ISE functionality.
Disk Space Check
Checks the hard disk located in the Platform Support Check, and the free space available in the disk for further upgrade procedures.
We recommend that you run a Disk Space Check before you begin the upgrade operation to avoid performance issues.
NTP Reachability and Time Source Check
Checks the NTP configured in the system and whether the time source is the NTP server.
NTP synchronization is essential for Cisco ISE services such as AD operations, upgrade workflows, and so on.
Load Average Check
Checks system load at specified intervals. The valid interval configurations are 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
Load Average Check failures could lead to performance issues in Cisco ISE.
MDM Validation
Checks for connectivity between the configured MDM servers and Cisco ISE PSN servers.
To use the MDM-supported features in Cisco ISE, the MDM Validation Check must be successful.
License Validation
Checks if Smart Licensing is configured and valid. If your smart licences are not configured or are valid, a warning is displayed in the Cisco ISE GUI asking you to configure and validate your licenses.
Cisco ISE Release 3.0 and later releases support only Smart Licensing. Convert your traditional licenses to smart licenses before you upgrade to Cisco ISE Release 3.0 and later releases.
Services or Process Failures
Checks if the status of a service or application is in Running or Failed state.

Note
The numbers adjacent to the deployment indicates the number of nodes and their health check details. For example, if a deployment has 0/2, 0 indicates the number of nodes that are in Failed, In progress, and Completed and 2 indicates the number of nodes in the deployment.

Note
During the health check, if any node does not send back response for 15 minutes, health check for that specific node gets timed out.
Run Health Check

Network Privilege Framework Event Flow Process
The Network Privilege Framework (NPF) authentication and authorization event flow uses the process described in the following table:
Process Stage
Description
1
Network Access Device (NAD) performs either a normal authorization or a flex authorization.
2
An unknown agentless identity is profiled with web authorization.
3
A RADIUS server authenticates and authorizes the identity.
4
Authorization is provisioned for the identity at the port.
5
Unauthorized endpoint traffic is dropped.
User Roles and Permissions for Monitoring and Troubleshooting Capabilities
Monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities are associated with default user roles. The tasks you are allowed to perform are directly related to your assigned user role.
See Cisco ISE Administrator Groups for information on the permissions and restrictions set for each user role.
See section "Cisco ISE Administrator Groups" in Chapter "Cisco ISE Admin Guide: Overview" in Cisco ISE Administrator Guide for information on the permissions and restrictions set for each user role.

Note
Accessing Cisco ISE using the root shell without Cisco TAC supervision is not supported, and Cisco is not responsible for any service disruption that might be caused as a result.
Data Stored in the Monitoring Database
The Cisco ISE monitoring service collects and stores data in a specialized monitoring database. The rate and amount of data utilized to monitor network functions may require a node dedicated solely to monitoring. If your Cisco ISE network collects logging data at a high rate from policy service nodes or network devices, we recommend a Cisco ISE node dedicated to monitoring.
To manage the information stored in the monitoring database, perform full and incremental backups of the database. This includes purging unwanted data and then restoring the database.
Cisco ISE Telemetry
Telemetry monitors your system and the devices in your network to provide feedback to Cisco on how you use the product. Cisco uses this information to improve the product.
Cisco ISE telemetry data communication occurs as HTTPS traffic through Port 443 with https://connectdna.cisco.com/.
Telemetry is enabled by default. To disable this feature:
In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > System > Settings > Network Success Diagnostics > Telemetry
Uncheck the Enable Telemetry check box to disable telemetry.
Cisco Account: Enter your Cisco account credentials so that you can get emails from Telemetry. We may also use this ID to contact you if Telemetry finds any serious issues that may affect your Cisco ISE deployment..
Transport Gateway: You can use a proxy between your Cisco ISE and the Cisco external telemetry servers for extra security. To do this, check this check box and enter the FQDN of your proxy server. Telemetry does not require a proxy.
Cisco provides software for Transport Gateway. You can download from cisco.com. This software runs on a Linux server. See the Smart Call Home Deployment Guide for information on how to deploy the Transport Gateway software on an RHEL server. If you are using this Cisco software, the URL value is <FQDN of proxyserver>/Transportgateway/services/DeviceRequestHandler. You can use this gateway to connect to the Smart Licensing server, too. From Version 3.5 of the Transport Gateway, you cannot change the port, but you can enter IP address instead of the FQDN.

SNMP Traps to Monitor Cisco ISE
SNMP traps help you to monitor the status of Cisco ISE. If you want to monitor Cisco ISE without accessing the Cisco ISE server, you can configure a MIB browser as an SNMP host in Cisco ISE. You can then monitor the status of Cisco ISE from the MIB browser.
See the Cisco Identity Services Engine CLI Reference Guide for information on the snmp-server host and snmp-server trap commands.
Cisco ISE supports SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, and SNMPv3.
Cisco ISE sends the following generic system traps if you configure the SNMP host from the CLI:
Cold start: When the device reboots.
Linkup: When Ethernet interface is up.
Linkdown: When Ethernet interface is down.
Authentication failure: When the community strings do not match.
The following table lists the generic SNMP traps that are generated by default in Cisco ISE.
OID
Description
Trap Example
.1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.4.0.3 \n
NET-SNMP-AGENT-MIB::nsNotifyRestart
Indicates that the agent has been restarted.
DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::sysUpTimeInstance = Timeticks: (478) 0:00:04.78       SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapOID.0 = OID: NET-SNMP-AGENT-MIB::nsNotifyRestart    SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapEnterprise.0 = OID: NET-SNMP-MIB::netSnmpNotificationPrefix
.1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.4.0.2 \n
NET-SNMP-AGENT-MIB::nsNotifyShutdown
Indicates that the agent is in the process of being shut down.
DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::sysUpTimeInstance = Timeticks: (479) 0:00:04.79 SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapOID.0 = OID: NET-SNMP-AGENT-MIB::nsNotifyShutdown SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapEnterprise.0 = OID: NET-SNMP-MIB::netSnmpNotificationPrefix
.1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.4 \n
IF-MIB::linkUp
Signifies that the SNMP entity, acting in an agent role, has detected that the ifOperStatus object for one of its communication links left the Down state and transitioned into some other state (but not into the notPresent state). This other state is indicated by the included value of ifOperStatus.
DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::sysUpTimeInstance = Timeticks: (478) 0:00:04.78 SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapOID.0 = OID: IF-MIB::linkUp IF-MIB::ifIndex.12 = INTEGER: 12 IF-MIB::ifAdminStatus.12 = INTEGER: up(1) IF-MIB::ifOperStatus.12 = INTEGER: up(1) SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapEnterprise.0 = OID: NET-SNMP-MIB::netSnmpAgentOIDs.10
.1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.3 \n
IF-MIB::linkDown
Signifies that the SNMP entity, acting in an agent role, has detected that the ifOperStatus object for one of its communication links is about to enter the Down state from some other state (but not from the notPresent state). This other state is indicated by the included value of ifOperStatus.
DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::sysUpTimeInstance = Timeticks: (479) 0:00:04.79 SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapOID.0 = OID: IF-MIB::linkDown IF-MIB::ifIndex.5 = INTEGER: 5 IF-MIB::ifAdminStatus.5 = INTEGER: up(1) IF-MIB::ifOperStatus.5 = INTEGER: down(2) SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapEnterprise.0 = OID: NET-SNMP-MIB::netSnmpAgentOIDs.10
.1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.1 \n
SNMPv2-MIB::coldStart
Signifies that the SNMP entity, supporting a notification originator application, is reinitializing itself and that its configuration may have been altered.
DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::sysUpTimeInstance = Timeticks: (8) 0:00:00.08 SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapOID.0 = OID: SNMPv2-MIB::coldStart SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapEnterprise.0 = OID: NET-SNMP-MIB::netSnmpAgentOIDs.10
Process-Monitoring SNMP Traps in Cisco ISE
Cisco ISE allows you to send hrSWRunName traps for Cisco ISE process statuses to the SNMP manager if you configure an SNMP host from the Cisco ISE CLI. Cisco ISE uses a cron job to trigger these traps. The cron job retrieves the Cisco ISE process status from Monit. After you configure the SNMP-Server Host command from the CLI, a cron job runs every five minutes and monitors Cisco ISE.

Note
When an ISE process is manually stopped by an admin, Monit for the process also stops and no traps are sent to the SNMP manager. A process-stop SNMP trap is sent to the SNMP manager only when a process accidentally shuts down and is not automatically revived.
The following is a list of process-monitoring SNMP traps in Cisco ISE.
OID
Description
Trap Example
.1.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.2 \n
HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSWRunName
A textual description of this running piece of software, including the manufacturer, revision, and the name by which it is commonly known. If this software was installed locally, this must be the same string as that used in the corresponding hrSWInstalledName. The services considered are app-server, rsyslog, redis-server, ad-connector, mnt-collector, mnt-processor, ca-server est-server, and elasticsearch.
DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::sysUpTimeInstance = Timeticks: (63692139) 7 days, 8:55:21.39 SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapOID.0 = OID: HOSTRESOURCES- MIB::hrSWRunName HOSTRESOURCES- MIB::hrSWRunName = STRING: "redis-server:Running"
Cisco ISE sends traps for the following statuses to the configured SNMP server:
Process Start (monitored state)
Process Stop (not monitored state)
Execution Failed: When the process state changes from Monitored to Execution Failed, a trap is sent.
Does Not Exist: When the process state changes from Monitored to Does Not Exist, a trap is sent.
A unique object ID (OID) is generated for every object in the SNMP server and a value is assigned to the OID. You can find the object with its OID value in the SNMP server. The OID value for a running trap is running, and the OID value for the Not monitored, Does not exist, and Execution failed traps is stopped.
Cisco ISE sends traps using the OID of hrSWRunName that belongs to the HOST-RESOURCES MIB, and sets the OID value as < PROCESS NAME > - < PROCESS STATUS >, for example, runtime - running.
To stop Cisco ISE from sending SNMP traps to the SNMP server, remove the SNMP configuration from the Cisco ISE CLI. This operation stops sending SNMP traps and polling from the SNMP manager.
Disk Utilization SNMP Traps in Cisco ISE
When a Cisco ISE partition reaches its threshold disk utilization limit and the configured amount of free space is reached, the disk utilization trap is sent.
The following is a list of disk utilization SNMP traps that can be configured in Cisco ISE:
OID
Description
Trap Example
.1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.9.1.9 \n
UCD-SNMP-MIB::dskPercent
Percentage of space used in the disk.
DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::sysUpTimeInstance = Timeticks: (118198297) 13 days, 16:19:42.97 SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapOID.0 = OID: UCD-SNMP-MIB::dskPercent UCD-SNMP-MIB::dskPercent = INTEGER: 13
.1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.9.1.2 \n
UCD-SNMP-MIB::dskPath
Path where the disk is mounted.
dskPath can send traps for all the mount points in the output of the ISE admin command show disks .
DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::sysUpTimeInstance = Timeticks: (118198304) 13 days, 16:19:43.04       SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapOID.0 = OID: UCD-SNMP-MIB::dskPath  UCD-SNMP-MIB::dskPath = STRING: /opt
Cisco ISE Alarms
Alarms notify you of critical conditions on a network and are displayed in the Alarms dashlet. They also provide information on system activities, such as data purge events. You can either configure how you want to be notified about system activities, or disable them entirely. You can also configure the threshold for certain alarms.
Most alarms do not have an associated schedule and are sent immediately after an event occurs. At any given point in time, only the latest 15,000 alarms are retained.
If the event recurs, the same alarms are suppressed for about an hour. During the time that the event recurs, depending on the trigger, it may take about an hour for the alarms to reappear.
You can filter the alarms you want to view based on alarm name, category, severity, or status. As you select filters, the effects are additive, also referred to as cascading filter, which allows you to drill down to find the particular data you are looking for.
The Quick Filter allows you to enter a value for any of the field attributes displayed in the listing page, refreshes the page, and lists only those records that match your filter criteria.
The Advanced Filter allows you to filter information based on specified conditions, such as, Alarm Name contains TrustSec. You can specify more than one condition.
You can create and save user-specific custom filters that are accessible only to you.
Click Clear All Filters to remove all the applied filters.
The following table lists all the Cisco ISE alarms, descriptions, and resolutions.

System Health
High Disk I/O Utilization
Cisco ISE system is experiencing high disk I/O utilization.
Check if the system has sufficient resources. Check the actual amount of work on the system, for example, number of authentications, profiler activity, and so on. Add an additional server to distribute the load.
High Disk Space Utilization
Cisco ISE system is experiencing high disk space utilization.
Check if the system has sufficient resources. Check the actual amount of work on the system, for example, number of authentications, profiler activity, and so on. Add an additional server to distribute the load.
High Load Average
Cisco ISE system is experiencing high load average.
Check if the system has sufficient resources. Check the actual amount of work on the system, for example, number of authentications, profiler activity, and so on. Add an additional server to distribute the load.
Do not use third-party tools to check the load average on a single CPU core because this metric would not reflect the overall system load. We recommend that you use the tech top command in the Cisco ISE CLI for a cumulative view of the system load.
If the High Load Average alarm is seen against 2:00 a.m. time stamps for Primary and Secondary MnT nodes, note that CPU usage might be high due to DBMS statistics being run at that hour. CPU usage will be back to normal after the DBMS stats is complete.
A High Load Average alarm is triggered at 1:00 a.m. every Sunday by a weekly maintenance task. This maintenance task rebuilds all the indexes that occupy more than 1 GB space. This alarm can be ignored.

Check if the system has sufficient resources. Check the actual amount of work on the system, for example, number of authentications, profiler activity, and so on. Add an additional server to distribute the load.
Do not use third-party tools to check memory utilization. We recommend that you use the show memory command in the Cisco ISE CLI to check memory utilization.
In a Cisco ISE node, its operating system manages memory utilization. You must check for the available memory (instead of free memory) metric for a more reliable measure of memory utilization.
Note that an operating system segments most of the memory in buffer or cache. If less than 90% of the total memory is displayed as used, and there is no substantial increase in swap memory, Cisco ISE memory utilization can be considered stable.

Field Name
Description
Time
Shows the time at which the log was received by the monitoring and troubleshooting collection agent. This column is required and cannot be deselected.
Status
Shows if the authentication succeeded or failed. This column is mandatory and cannot be deselected. Green is used to represent passed authentications. Red is used to represent failed authentications.
Details
Clicking the icon under the Details column opens the Accounting Detail Report in a new browser window. This report offers information about authentication and related attributes, and authentication flow.
Clicking the icon under the Details column opens the Accounting Detail report if an accounting event is processed for that session. If the session is in authenticated state, Authentication Detail report is displayed when you click the icon under the Details column.
The Response Time in the Authentication Detail report is the total time taken by Cisco ISE to process the authentication flow. For example, if authentication consists of three roundtrip messages that took 300 ms for the initial message, 150 ms for the next message, and 100 ms for the last, Response Time is 300 + 150 + 100 = 550 ms.
Note
  You cannot view the details for endpoints that are active for more than 48 hours. You will see a window with the following message when you click the Details icon for endpoints that are active for more than 48 hours: No Data available for this record. Either the data is purged or authentication for this session record happened a week ago. Or if this is an 'PassiveID' or 'PassiveID Visibility' session, it will not have authentication details on ISE but only the session.

In addition to authentication entries, this window also shows the live session entries corresponding to the events. You can also drill-down a session to view a detailed report corresponding to that session.
The Live Authentications window provides a tabular account of recent RADIUS authentications, in the order in which they occur. The last update shown at the bottom of the Live Authentications window shows the date of the server, time, and timezone.

Note
If the password attribute in an Access-Request packet is empty, an error message is triggered and the access request fails.
When a single endpoint is authenticated successfully, two entries appear in the Live Authentications window—one corresponding to the authentication record and another corresponding to the session record (pulled from the session live view). Subsequently, when the device performs another successful authentication, the repeat counter corresponding to the session record is incremented. The Repeat Counter that appears in the Live Authentications window shows the number of duplicate RADIUS authentication success messages that are suppressed.
See the Live Authentication data categories that are shown by default. These are described in the Recent RADIUS Authentications section.
You can choose to view all the columns, or only selected data columns. After selecting the columns that you want to be displayed, you can save your selections.

Filter Data in the Live Authentications Page
Filter Data in the Live Authentications Page
Using the filters in the Live Authentications window, you can filter the information that you need, and troubleshoot network authentication issues quickly. You can filter records in the Authentication Live Logs window and view only those records that you are interested in. The authentication logs contain many details, and filtering the authentications by a particular user or location helps you scan the data quickly. You can use several operators that are available in the Live Authentications window to filter out records based on your search criteria.:
'abc' : Contains 'abc'
'!abc' : Does not contain 'abc'
'{}' : Is empty
'!{}' : Is not empty
'abc*' : Starts with 'abc'
'*abc' : Ends with 'abc'
'\!', '\*', '\{', '\\' : Escape
The Escape option allows you to filter text with special characters (including the special characters used as filters). You must prefix the special character with a backward slash (\). For example, if you want to view the authentication records of users with identity "Employee!," enter "Employee\!" in the Identity Filter field. In this example, Cisco ISE considers the exclamation mark (!) as a literal character and not as a special character.
In addition, the Status field allows you to filter only passed authentication records, failed authentications, live sessions, and so on. The green check mark filters all the passed authentications that occurred in the past. The red cross mark filters all failed authentications. The blue i icon filters all the live sessions. You can also choose to view a combination of these options.
Procedure
Step 1
In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Operations > RADIUS > Live Logs
Step 2
Filter data based on any of the fields in the Show Live Authentications window.
You can filter the results based on passed or failed authentications, or live sessions.

Note
  Cisco ISE relies on the nas-update=true attribute from WLC to identify whether the session is in roaming state. When the original WLC sends an accounting stop attribute with nas-update=true, the session is not deleted in ISE to avoid reauthentication. If roaming fails, ISE clears the session after five days of inactivity.

Source First Port
(Values are displayed only for the REST provider) Shows the first port allocated by the Terminal Server Agent.
A Terminal Server refers to a server or network device that allows multiple endpoints to connect to it without a modem or network interface and facilities the connection of the multiple endpoints to a LAN network. The multiple endpoints appear to have the same IP address, and therefore, it is difficult to identify the IP address of a specific user. Consequently, to identify a specific user, a Terminal Server Agent is installed in the server, which allocates a port range to each user. This helps create an IP address-port user mapping.
TS Agent ID
(Values are displayed only for the REST provider) Shows the unique identity of the Terminal Server Agent that is installed on an endpoint.
AD User Resolved Identities
(Values are displayed only for AD user) Shows the potential accounts that matched.
AD User Resolved DNs
(Values are displayed only for AD user) Shows the Distinguished Name of AD user, for example, CN=chris,CN=Users,DC=R1,DC=com

Use TCP Dump to Monitor Network Traffic
The TCP Dump window lists TCP dump process files that you create. You can create different files for different purposes, run them as needed, and delete them when you don't need them.
You can control the data that is collected by specifying size, number of files, and how long the process runs. If the process finishes before the time limit, and the file is less than the maximum size, and you enabled more than one file, then the process continues and creates another dump file.
You can run TCP dump on more interfaces, including bonded interfaces.

Note
Human-readable format is no longer an option; the dump file is always in raw format.
We support IPv6 connections to the repository.
Before you begin
The Network Interface drop-down list in the TCP Dump window displays only the network interface cards (NICs) that have an IPv4 or IPv6 address configured. By default in VMware, all the NICs are connected, which means that all the NICs have an IPv6 address and are displayed in the Network Interface drop-down list.
Procedure
Step 1
In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Operations > Troubleshoot > Diagnostic Tools > General Tools > TCP Dump.
Step 2
From the Host Name drop-down list, choose the source for the TCP Dump utility.

ip host 10.77.122.123
ip host ISE123
ip host 10.77.122.123 and not 10.77.122.119
Step 5
Enter a File Name for this TCP dump process.
Step 6
From the Repository drop-down list, choose a repository to store TCP dump log files in.
Step 7
From the File Size drop-down list—Select a maximum file size.
If the dump exceeds this file size, a new file opens to continue the dump. The number of times the dump can continue to a new file is limited by the Limit to setting.
Step 8
The Limit to option can be used to limit the number of files that the dump can expand into.
Step 9
The Time Limit option can be used to configure how long a dump runs before ending.
Step 10
Set Promiscuous Mode by clicking On or Off. The default is On.
Promiscuous mode is the default packet sniffing mode in which the network interface passes all traffic to the system’s CPU. We recommend that you leave it set to On.

Debug logs: Captures bootstrap, application configuration, run-time, deployment, public key infrastructure (PKI) information, and monitoring and reporting.
Debug logs provide troubleshooting information for specific Cisco ISE components. To enable debug logs, see chapter 11 on Logging. If you do not enable the debug logs, all the informational messages (INFO) will be included in the support bundle. For more information, see Cisco ISE Debug Logs.
Local logs: Contains syslog messages from the various processes that run on Cisco ISE.
Core files: Contains critical information that helps identify the cause of a crash. These logs are created when the application crashes, and includes heap dumps.
Monitoring and reporting logs: Contains information about alerts and reports.
System logs: Contains Cisco Application Deployment Engine-related (ADE-related) information.
Policy configuration: Contains policies configured in Cisco ISE in human-readable format.
You can download these logs from the Cisco ISE CLI by using the backup-logs command. For more information, see the Cisco Identity Services Engine CLI Reference Guide.

Note
For Inline Posture node, you cannot download the support bundle from the Admin portal. You must use the backup-logs command from the Cisco ISE CLI.
If you choose to download these logs from the Admin portal, you can do the following:
Download only a subset of logs based on the log type, such as debug logs or system logs.
Download only the latest n number of files for the selected log type. This option allows you to control the size of the support bundle and the time taken for download.
Monitoring logs provide information about the monitoring, reporting, and troubleshooting features. For more information about downloading logs, see Download Cisco ISE Log Files.
Support Bundle
You can download the support bundle to your local computer as a simple tar.gpg file. The support bundle will be named with the date and time stamps in the format ise-support-bundle_ise-support-bundle-mm-dd-yyyy--hh-mm.tar..gpg. The browser prompts you to save the support bundle to an appropriate location. You can extract the content of the support bundle and view the README.TXT file, which describes the contents of the support bundle, as well as how to import the contents of the ISE database if it is included in the support bundle.
Download Cisco ISE Log Files
You can download the Cisco ISE log files to look for more information while troubleshooting issues in your network.
You can also download system logs that include ADE-OS and other log files to troubleshoot installation and upgrade issues.
While downloading a support bundle, instead of entering an encryption key manually, you can choose to use a public key for encryption. If you choose this option, Cisco PKI will be used for encryption and decryption of the support bundle. Cisco TAC maintains the public and private keys. Cisco ISE uses the public keys to encrypt the support bundle. Cisco TAC can decrypt the support bundle using the private keys. Use this option if you want to provide the support bundle to Cisco TAC for troubleshooting. Use the shared key encryption if you are going to troubleshoot the issues on premise.
Before you begin
You must have Super Admin or System Admin privileges to perform the following task.
You should have configured the debug logs and debug log levels.
Procedure
Step 1
In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Operations > Troubleshoot > Download Logs > Appliance Node List.
Step 2
Click the node from which you want to download the support bundles.
Step 3
In the Support Bundle tab, choose the parameters that you want to be populated in your support bundle.
If you include all the logs, your support bundle will be excessively large and the download will take a long time. To optimize the download process, choose to download only the most recent n number of files.
Step 4
Enter the From and To dates for which you want to generate the support bundle.
Step 5
Choose one of the following:
Public Key Encryption: Choose this option if you want to provide the support bundle to Cisco TAC for troubleshooting purposes.
Shared Key Encryption: Choose this option if you want to troubleshoot the issues locally on premise. If you choose this option, you must enter the encryption key for the support bundle.
Step 6
Enter and re-enter the encryption key for the support bundle.
Step 7
Click Create Support Bundle.
Step 8
Click Download to download the newly-created support bundle.
The support bundle is a tar.gpg file that is downloaded to the client system that is running your application browser.
What to do next
Download debug logs for specific components.
Cisco ISE Debug Logs
Debug logs provide troubleshooting information for various Cisco ISE components. Debug logs contain critical and warning alarms generated over the last 30 days, and information alarms generated over the last seven days. While reporting problems, you might be asked to enable these debug logs and send them for diagnosis and resolution of your problems.

Note
Enabling debug logs with heavy load (such as monitoring debug logs) will generate alarms about high load.
