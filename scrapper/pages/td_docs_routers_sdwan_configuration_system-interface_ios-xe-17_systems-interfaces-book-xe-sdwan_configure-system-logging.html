Ability to Send Syslog Messages over TLS
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r
This feature allows you to transport syslog messages to external configured hosts by establishing a Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection. Using the TLS protocol enables the content of syslog messages to remain confidential, secure, and untampered or unaltered during each hop.

System Logging
System logging operations use a mechanism similar to the UNIX syslog command to record system-wide, high-level operations that occur on Cisco SD-WAN devices in the overlay network. The log levels (priorities) of the messages are the same as standard UNIX commands, and you can configure the priority of syslog messages. Cisco SD-WAN devices can send log messages to a UNIX-style syslog service.
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices send syslog messages to syslog servers on configured external hosts using TCP and UDP. When these devices are sending the syslog messages, the messages might transit several hops to reach the output destination. The intermediate networks during the hops might not be trustworthy, be in a different domain, or have a different security level. Therefore, Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices now support sending secure syslog messages over the Transport Layer Security (TLS) as per RFC5425. To secure the syslog message content from potential tampering, the TLS protocol is used for certificate exchange, mutual authentication, and ciphers negotiation.
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices supports both mutual and server authentication for sending syslog messages over TLS.
Syslog Message Format, Syslog Message Levels, and System Log Files
Syslog Message Format
Syslog messages begin with a percent sign (%) and following are the syslog message formats:
Syslog message format
seq no:timestamp: %facility-severity-MENEMONIC:description (hostname-n)
Syslog message format based on RFC5424
<pri>ver timestamp hostname appname procid msgid structured data description/msg

Note
In the syslog message format based on RFC5424, the optional fields such as, hostname, appname, procId, msgId, structured data are specified with a -.
The field descriptions of syslog messages are:
Table 2. Field Descriptions of Syslog Message Format
Field
Description
facility
Sets the logging facility to a value other than 20, which UNIX systems expect.
severity
The importance or severity of the message is categorized by the numerical code from 0 through 7. A lower number in this range indicates greater severity of the system condition.
msg or description
A text string that describes the condition of syslog server. This portion of the syslog message sometimes includes IP addresses, interface names, port numbers, or usernames.
In syslog message formats based on RFC5424, the description represents: %facility-severity-MENEMONIC:description
Usually, the syslog messages are preceded by extra text.
The following is an example of a system logging message preceded by a priority value, sequence number, and time stamp:
<45>10: polaris-user1: *Jun 21 10:76:84.100: %LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface GigabitEthernet0/0, changed state to administratively down
Based on RFC5424, the following is an example of a system logging message preceded by a priority value, version of syslog protocol specification, and time stamp:
<45>1 2003-10-11T22:14:15.003Z 10.64.48.125 polaris-user1 - - - %LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface GigabitEthernet0/0, changed state to administratively down

Note
The time stamp formats are not the same in both the syslog message formats. In the message format based on RFC5424, T, and Z are mandatory where T represents a separator and Z represents zero timezone.
Syslog Message Levels
All syslog messages are associated with priority levels that indicate the severity of syslog messages to save. The default priority value is "informational", so by default, all syslog messages are recorded. The priority level can be one of the following in order of decreasing severity:
Emergency—System is unusable (corresponds to syslog severity 0).
Alert—Ensure that you act immediately (corresponds to syslog severity 1).
Critical—A serious condition (corresponds to syslog severity 2).
Error—An error condition that does not fully impair system usability (corresponds to syslog severity 3).
Warning—A minor error condition (corresponds to syslog severity 4).
Notice—A normal, but significant condition (corresponds to syslog severity 5).
Informational—Routine condition (the default) (corresponds to syslog severity 6).
Debug—Issues debug messages that correspond to syslog severity 7.
System Log Files
All syslog messages that are at or above the default or configured priority value are recorded in a number of files in the /var/log directory on the local device of the syslog server. The following are the contents of the log files:
auth.log—Login, logout, and superuser access events, and usage of authorization systems
kern.log—Kernel messages
messages.log—Consolidated log file that contains syslog messages from all sources.
vconfd.log—All configuration-related syslog messages
vdebug.log—All debug messages for modules whose debugging is turned on and all syslog messages that are above the default priority value. The debug log messages support various levels of logging based on the module. The different modules implement the logging levels differently. For example, the system manager (sysmgr) has two logging levels (on and off), while the chassis manager (chmgr) has four different logging levels (off, low, normal, and high). You cannot send debug messages to a remote host. Therefore, to enable debugging, use the debug operational command.
vsyslog.log—All syslog messages from Cisco SD-WAN processes (daemons) that are above the configured priority value. The default priority value is "informational", so by default, all "notice", "warning", "error", "critical", "alert", and "emergency" syslog messages are saved.
vmanage-syslog.log—Cisco vManage NMS Audit log messages
The following are the standard LINUX files that Cisco SD-WAN does not use and are available in the /var/log directory.
cron.log
debug.log
lpr.log
mail.log
syslog
The messages sent to syslog files are not rate-limited and consequently:
A storage limit of 10 log files with a capacity of up to 16 MB size is set for each syslog file.
When the storage capacity exceeds the 16 MB size limit, the log file is saved as a .GZ file along with the date appended to it.
When the storage limit exceeds 10 log files, the oldest log file is dropped.
If many syslog messages are generated in a short span of time, the overflowing messages are buffered and queued to be stored in the syslog file.
For repeating syslog messages or identical messages that occur multiple times in succession, only one copy of the message is placed in the syslog file. The message is annotated to indicate the number of times the message occurred.
The maximum length of a log message is 1024 bytes. The longer messages are truncated.
The maximum length of a log message for Cisco vManage NMS audit logs is 1024 bytes. The longer messages are truncated into smaller fragments and each of these fragments are indicated by an identifier. The identifiers are, fragment 1/2, fragment 2/2, and so on. For example, a long audit log message when truncated into smaller fragments appears as:
local6.info: 18-Oct-2020 17:42:07 vm10 maintenance-fragment-1/2: {“logid”: “d9ed576a-43ae-49ce-921b-a51c1ed40698”, “entry_time”:

“10.0.1.1”, “logmessage”: “Device validation Upgrade to version — Validation success”, “logdeviceid”:”Validation”, “auditdetails” :
[“[18-Oct-2020 17:42:08 UTC] Published messages to vmanage(s)”, “auditdetails”:[“[18-Oct-2020 17:42:07 UTC] Software image: vmanage-99.99.999-
x86_64.tar.gz”, “Software image download may take up to 60}
local6.info: 18-Oct-2020 17:42:07 vm10 maintenance-fragment-2/2: { minutes”, “logprocessid”: “software_install-7de0ec44-d290-4429-b24532435324”, “tenant”:, “default”}
The syslog messages related to AAA authentication and Netconf CLI access and usage are placed in the auth.log and messages.log files. Each time a Cisco vManage NMS logs into a router to retrieve statistics and status information and to push files to the router, the router generates AAA and Netconf log messages. So, over time, these messages can fill the log files. To prevent these messages from filling the log files, you can disable the logging of AAA and Netconf syslog messages by using the following commands from Cisco vManage NMS:
Disable logging of AAA and Netconf Syslog Messages
vManage# config
Enters the configuration mode terminal
vManage(config)# system aaa logs
Configures the logging of AAA and Netconf system logging (syslog) messages
vManage(config-logs)# audit-disable
Disable logging of AAA events
vManage(config-logs)# netconf-disable
Disable logging of Netconf events
vManage(config-logs)# commit
Commit complete.
Benefits of Using TLS for Sending Syslog Messages
The benefits of using TLS for sending syslog messages are:
Confidentiality of message content where each TLS session begins with a handshake between the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device and the syslog server. The Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device and syslog server agree on the specific security key and the encryption algorithms to be used for that session. The TLS session opposes any disclosure of the contents of the syslog message.
Integrity-checking of the content of each message to disable modifications to a message during transit on a hop-by-hop basis.
Mutual authentication between the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device and syslog server ensures that the syslog server accepts log messages only from authorized clients through certificate exchange.
Configure Logging in Server Authentication for TLS
In server authentication, Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices verify the identity of the syslog server. If the syslog server and the certificate are legitimate entities, the device establishes a TLS connection with the server. For implementing server authentication, the syslog server shares the public certificate with the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
Prerequisite
Ensure that Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices have preinstalled Root Certificate Authority (CA), which you configure using cryptographic module CLIs. See Install root CA on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device.
To configure TLS profile for syslog server, perform the following steps:
Configure logging feature template using Cisco vManage.
Configure logging attributes to local disk.
Configure syslog server for TLS.
Create a device template from logging feature template.
Configure Logging in Mutual Authentication for TLS
In mutual authentication, both the syslog server and Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device authenticate each other at the same time. Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices must have root or identity certificates for mutual authentication of the TLS session. To configure TLS profile for syslog server, perform the following steps:
Install Syslog Root Certificate on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device.
Configure logging feature template using Cisco vManage.
Configure logging attributes to local disk.
Generate Feature Certificate Signing Request and Install Feature Certificates
Configure syslog server for TLS.
Create a device template from logging feature template.
Generate Feature Certificate Signing Request and Install Feature Certificates.
Verify trustpoint configuration on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device.
Install Root Certificate Authority on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Device for Server Authentication
Before you begin
Ensure that you generate the encoded CA certificate on the syslog server. See Install Root Certificate Authority on Syslog Server for Server Authentication.
Procedure
Step 1
To configure PKI trustpoint for Certificate Authority, use these commands for authorizing and revocation of certificates in PKI.
enable
Enables privileged EXEC mode.
Example:
Cisco XE SD-WAN> enable
config-transaction
Enters the configuration mode.
Example:
Cisco XE SD-WAN# config-transaction
crypto pki trustpoint name
Declares the trustpoint and a given name and enters CA-trustpoint configuration mode.
Example:
Cisco XE SD-WAN (config)# crypto pki trustpoint Syslog-signing-CA
enrollment [mode] [retry period minutes ] [retry count number ] url url [pem ]
Specifies the enrollment parameters of the CA.
Example:
Cisco XE SD-WAN(ca-trustpoint)# enrollment terminal
chain-validation [{stop | continue}[parent-trustpoint]]
Configures the level to which a certificate chain is processed on all certificates.
Example:
Cisco XE SD-WAN(ca-trustpoint)# chain-validation stop
revocation-check method
(Optional) Checks the revocation status of a certificate.
Example:
Cisco XE SD-WAN(ca-trustpoint)# revocation-check none
exit
Returns to global configuration mode.
Example:
Cisco XE SD-WAN(ca-trustpoint)# exit
Step 2
Retrieve and authenticate the Root CA before the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device can be issued a certificate and certificate enrollment occurs.
To authenticate the CA, use the crypto pki authenticate command.
Example:
Cisco XE SD-WAN(config)# crypto pki authenticate root
Step 3
Copy the block of text containing the base 64 encoded CA certificate and paste it at the prompt.
To generate and copy the text containing the encoded CA certificate, see Install Root Certificate Authority on Syslog Server for Server Authentication.
Example:
A sample base 64 encoded CA certificate:

Install Root Certificate Authority on Syslog Server for Server Authentication
In this document, the following steps describe the procedure to set up syslog-ng server that supports TLS.
Procedure
Step 1
To install syslog-ng on the server, use the following command:
Example:
# apt-get install syslog-ng openssl
Step 2
To change the directory to syslog-ng folder and create folders to store the root certificates, use the following commands:
Example:
# cd /etc/syslog-ng
# mkdir cert.d
# mkdir key.d
# mkdir ca.d
# cd cert.d
# openssl req -new -x509 -out cacert.pem -days 1095 -nodes
# mv privkey.pem ../key.d
After using the openssl command, an encoded root certificate is available in cacert.pem file. The file is located in the cd/etc/syslog-ng/cert.d directory.
Step 3
Copy the content from the cacert.pem file when installing root certificate on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Device. See Step 3 of Install Root Certificate Authority on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Device for Server Authentication.

Install Syslog Root Certificate on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Device for Mutual Authentication
To configure Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices with Transport Layer Security (TLS) syslog protocol, the devices must have root or identity certificates for mutual authentication of TLS session. You can either use a third-party Certificate Authority (CA) to get public key infrastructure (PKI) services, or Microsoft Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS). AD CS allows you to build a PKI and provide public key cryptography, digital certificates, and digital signature capabilities for your requirement.
Procedure
Step 1
Generate the enterprise root certificate using a third party CA or Microsoft Active Directory Certificate Services.
Step 2
Download the root CA in base 64 format, select and copy the content of root CA.
Step 3
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Administration > Settings.
Step 4
Click Enterprise Feature Certificate Authorization, and click Edit.
Step 5
Paste the root CA content in the Enterprise Root Certificate box.
Step 6
(Optional) if you want to generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR), check the Set CSR Properties check box.

Export Cisco vManage NMS Audit Log to Syslog Server
Table 7. Feature History
Feature Name
Release Information
Description
Export vManage Audit Log as Syslog
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1
The Cisco vManage NMS exports audit logs in syslog message format to a configured external syslog server. This feature allows you to consolidate and store network activity logs in a central location.
On Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices and Cisco vEdge devices, you can log event notification system log (syslog) messages to files on a local device, or to files on a remote host using CLI. These event notification logs are converted to system log files and exported to the syslog server. You can then retrieve system log information from the syslog server.
Configure System Logging Using CLI
View System Logging Information
Configure System Logging Using CLI
Log Syslog Messages to a Local Device
By default, a priority level of “information” is enabled when you log syslog messages to a file on a local device. Use the following commands:
logging disk
Logs syslog messages on a hard disk
Example:
vm01(config-system)# logging disk
enable
Enables logging to a disk
Example:
vm01(config-logging-disk)# enable
file size size
Specifies the size of syslog files in megabytes (MB) By default, the syslog files are 10 MB. You can configure the size of syslog files to be 1–20 MB.
Example:
vm01(config-logging-disk)# file size 3
file rotate number
Rotates syslog files on an hourly basis based on the size of the file By default, 10 syslog files are created. You can configure the rotate command to be a number from 1 through 10.
Example:
vm01(config-logging-disk)# file rotate 3
For more information about logging disk commands, see the logging disk command.
Log Syslog Messages to a Remote Device
To log event notification system log (syslog) messages to a remote host, use the following commands:
logging server
Logs syslog messages to a remote host or syslog server You can configure the name of the server by DNS name, hostname, or IP address. You can configure up to four syslog servers.
Example:
vm01(config-system)# logging server 192.168.0.1
(Optional) vpn vpn-id
Specifies the VPN ID of the syslog server
(Optional) source interface interface-name
Specifies the source interface to reach the syslog server. The interface name can be a physical interface or a sub-interface (a VLAN-tagged interface). Ensure that the interface is located in the same VPN as the syslog server. Otherwise, the configuration is ignored. If you configure multiple syslog servers, the source interface must be the same for all of them.
Example:
vm01(config-server-192.168.0.1)# source interface eth0
priority priority
Specifies the severity of the syslog message to be saved. The default priority value is "informational" and by default, all syslog messages are recorded.
Example:
In the following example, set the syslog priority to log alert conditions.
vm01(config-server-192.168.0.1)# priority alert
If the syslog server is unreachable, the system suspends sending syslog messages for 180 seconds. When the server becomes reachable, logging resumes. For more information about logging server commands, see the logging server command.
View System Logging Information
To view system log settings after logging syslog messages to a remote host, use the show logging command. For example:
vm01(config-server-192.168.0.1)# show logging

System logging
    server 192.168.0.1
    source interface eth0
    exit
!
!
To view the contents of the syslog file, use the show log command. For example:
vm01(config-server-192.168.0.1)# show log nms/vmanage-syslog.log tail 10 
To view the configured system logging settings from Cisco vManage, see Audit Log.
To view device-specific syslog files from Cisco vManage, perform the following steps:
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Administration > Settings, and ensure that you enable Data Stream.
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Monitor > Devices, and choose a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device
Cisco vManage Release 20.6.x and earlier: From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Monitor > Network, and choose a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device.
Click Troubleshooting.
From Logs, click Debug Log.
From Log Files, select a name of the log file to view the log information.
