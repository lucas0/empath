Software License Activation for Cisco RF Gateway 10 DS-384 Line Card
First Published: October, 2013
Last Updated: December, 2014
Software licensing allows a product to ship with a base set of functionality enabled, while containing advanced functionality that can be offered without a change in the underlying hardware. Using executable licenses helps in preventing the illegal use of the advanced functions.

Installing the License
Complete the following steps to install the license:
Step 1 Generate the license from the SWIFT tool.
Step 2 Receive the license key through email.
Step 3 Save the license file to the line card boot flash using the following command:
copy tftp:// ip-address / license-file linecard - slot-id- flash:
Step 4 Telnet to the line card using the following command:
cable telnet - slot-id-
Step 5 Login as root.
Step 6 Install the license file using the following command:
license install /flash/ license-file
  Upgrading the License
To enable all software features, all new or upgraded Cisco devices that require software activation must be registered with Cisco. The registration process requires a Product Authorization Key (PAK), which is an 11-character alphanumeric key printed on the purchase order document shipped with your device hardware. The registration process converts the PAK to an electronic license file containing a unique key for your device hardware. The license file must then be installed on your device to unlock the product.
Complete the following to upgrade and install a license:
Step 1 Purchase a PAK for the required type of license.
Step 2 Submit the PAK code and UDI of the line card to the Cisco Product License Registration portal. The portal retrieves the stock keeping units (SKUs) associated with the PAK.
Step 3 Select the SKU and enter the UDI, which is a unique and unchangeable identifier of the device where the license should be installed. A license key is then e-mailed to you, which you can use to upgrade the license.
Step 4 Install the license file returned from the license portal on the line card.

License Downgrade
Perform the following steps to install a permanent license for the Cisco RFGW-10 DS-384 line card with a downstream count lower than the existing active permanent license:
Step 1 Log in to the Cisco RFGW-10 DS-384 line card console.
Step 2 Enable the Cisco RFGW-10 DS-384 line card evaluation license with the license modify priority feature-name high command.
Step 3 Clear the permanent license with higher downstream count using the license clear feature-name command.
Step 4 Install the new permanent license with lower downstream count.
Step 5 Disable the Cisco RFGW-10 DS-384 line card evaluation license using the license modify priority feature-name low.
  Modifying the License Priority
To modify the license priority, use the following command:
license modify priority feature-name { high | low }
Return Materials Authorization
When a line card fails, a replacement card is required with equivalent licenses for restoring the services completely. If the failed line card has the same license as the shipping order, the return materials authorization (RMA) replacement and spares also have the same license as the failed line card.
To transfer a software license from a failed device to a new device, the devices must interact with the Cisco Product License Registration portal to initiate an RMA replacement license ( http://www.cisco.com/go/license).
Complete the following to initiate the RMA replacement license process:
Step 1 Obtain the UDI of the defective and RMA devices.
Step 2 Enter the UDI into the RMA License portal tool on Cisco.com.
The license portal determines licenses associated with defective device. The license portal issues replacement licenses.
Step 3 Install the new license on the new device.
  Rehost
The rehosting process transfers a license from one UDI to another by revoking the license from the source device and installing it on a new device.
Revoking the License on the Cisco DS-384 Line Card
Cisco DS-384 line card is the next generation line card for Cisco RFGW-10 and supports up to 128 downstream licenses. License is used for QAM channels.
A license is revoked to rehost or transfer the existing license to another line card.
Complete the following steps to revoke a Cisco DS-384 line card license:
Step 1 Save the license credential in the line card.
Step 2 Register the license credential to get a permission ticket.
Step 3 Revoke the license with the permission ticket to get a rehost ticket.
Step 4 Register the rehost ticket and obtain the rehosted license.
  Example for Revoking the License on the Cisco DS-384 Line Card
The following example shows the rehosting or transferring of 64 licenses from LC 3 (which has 128 licenses) to LC 5 (which has 64 licenses).
Step 1 Login into the line card console.
Step 2 Save the license credential to the line card flash using the following command:
# license save credential /flash/CAT1531E033_128P.lic_lcd
Device credential saved..... to /flash/CAT1531E033_128P.lic_lcd
Step 3 Use the more command on the Supervisor console to display the contents of device credentials and copy it:
# more /flash/CAT1531E033_128P.lic_lcd
WARNING: terminal is not fully functional
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><CISCO_WT_ARTIFACTS version="1.0"><CISCO_W/>
Step 4 Go to the following website and paste the device credentials to register and request a license transfer:
https://tools.cisco.com/SWIFT/LicensingUI/lookupLicenseForRehost
Note Log in with your Cisco.com user name and password.
Step 5 Copy the permission ticket ( pt.lic) to the TFTP server and download it to the Cisco RFGW-10 using the following command:
tftp:// ip_address /tftpboot/username/CAT1531E033_revoke.lic
Step 6 Revoke the license using the following command:
# license revoke /flash/ CAT1531E033_revoke.lic /flash/rehost.lic
Step 7 Use the more command to display the contents of the rehost ticket and copy it.
Step 8 Go to the following website and paste the rehost ticket to register and obtain the rehosted license:
https://tools.cisco.com/SWIFT/LicensingUI/rehostTktUploadRequest
Step 9 Receive the license key through email.
Step 10 Install the license key on the destination device.
