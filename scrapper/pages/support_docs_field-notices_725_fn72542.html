Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCwc39351 BEMS01445673 Security Alert OpenSSL CVE-2022-1292 / CVE-2022-1473 / CVE-2022-0778
Problem Description
If Perl version 5.30.1a is already installed on the server (by SWManager versions 914409 to 945177) with AP.platform.23.0.1075.ap383514 applied, BroadWorks fails to start.
Background
When Perl version 5.30.1a is already installed on the server (by SWManager versions 914409 to 945177), patch ap383514 does not install the new Perl upgrade which has the same version 5.30.1a. Consequently, BroadWorks fails to start.
Problem Symptom
After the patch is applied, the command startbw (used to start BroadWorks) fails with this error:
$ startbw

BroadWorks control script version 23.0

Can't locate object method "start_SSL" via package "IO::Socket::SSL" at
/usr/local/broadworks/AS_Rel_23.0_1.1075/bin/bcctConnection.pm line 214.
