    Transform your workplace with simple and intelligent experiences while eliminating the friction from the employee journey.

  Product overview
The table-stand model of Cisco Room Navigator is a 10-inch, platform-independent touch display that allows you to enable seamless workspace experiences by intuitively controlling your Cisco collaboration devices, apply video conference and room controls, and run third-party applications.
It can be deployed as a native RoomOS device for room controls or room scheduling, configured to run natively on Microsoft Teams Rooms, or set up in persistent web app mode to work with UMA, Appspace, and other workspace apps. Better still, it gives the flexibility to be deployed as a standalone device or paired with a video conferencing endpoint.
This touch-based unit was designed to create uninterrupted workflows and help maximize the utilization of your collaboration spaces while delivering these experiences in a way that is scalable, secure and easy to manage.
Cisco Room Navigator for table is a versatile device that combines controls, an intuitive display and sensors into an elegant touch panel. It can be either configured as a room control device or a room booking unit within meeting rooms.
It is a touch panel that gives intuitive access to multiple systems in interior spaces while the integrated sensors of the device provide the means to control and optimize the environment. When it is connected with a video device, it provides instant access to meetings, device controls, contacts, directories, and content. The device can be used to control conference systems, move partitions, curtains and other room peripherals, access third-party workspace applications and provide room booking capabilities.
The control display with its calm appearance and aesthetics showcases clean surfaces and fine details for a friendly, approachable look. It supports two positions on the table with different viewing angles, including a 180-degrees rotation of the user interface when the device is tilted. The device adapts smoothly from small to large conference spaces and huddle rooms while equipped with a detachable foot stand to enable easy disassembly, securely lock the cable and avoid connector strain.
You only need a single Ethernet cable to power the device and access the network. The Room Navigator can be connected directly to a Cisco video device or remotely paired to it via a PoE network.

Cisco Room Navigator is a competitive, feature-rich and highly flexible solution that can be used either as a room and conference control panel or a dedicated scheduling display. It offers advanced cloud device management capabilities in Control Hub, and offers rich sensor data that supports creating a safer and optimized workspace environment (requires connectivity with a video endpoint). It can be configured to run third-party applications to help you protect your existing workspace management and room booking investments. With the Room Navigator, you can experience frictionless meetings, effortless space reservation, and streamlined room and device integrations.
With the Cisco approach to workspace intelligence, you can significantly simplify your deployment, lower total cost of ownership and ease management efforts by leveraging a single vendor to provide platform agnostic video collaboration devices, the underlying meeting service, the room control hardware, and the associated room booking software solution.
