Introduction
This document describes how to configure Threat-Centric NAC with Qualys on Identity Services Engine (ISE) 2.1. Threat Centric Network Access Control (TC-NAC) feature enables you to create authorization policies based on the threat and vulnerability attributes received from the threat and vulnerability adapters.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have basic knowledge of these topics:
Cisco Identity Service Engine
Qualys ScanGuard
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
Cisco Identity Service Engine version 2.1
Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) 8.0.121.0
Qualys Guard Scanner 8.3.36-1, Signatures 2.3.364-2
Windows 7 Service Pack 1
Configure
High Level Flow Diagram
This is the flow:
Client connects to the network, limited access is given and profile with Assess Vulnerabilities checkbox enabled is assigned
PSN node sends Syslog message to MNT node confirming authentication took place and VA Scan was the result of Authorization Policy
MNT node submits SCAN to TC-NAC node (using Admin WebApp) using this data:
- MAC Address
- IP Address
- Scan Interval
- Periodic Scan Enabled
- Originating PSN
Qualys TC-NAC (encapsulated in Docker Container) communicates with Qualys Cloud (via REST API) to trigger scan if needed
Qualys Cloud instructs Qualys Scanner to scan the endpoint
Qualys Scanner sends the results of the scan to the Qualys Cloud
Results of the scan are sent back to TC-NAC:
- MAC Address
- All CVSS Scores
- All Vulnerabilities (QID, title, CVEIDs)
TC-NAC updates PAN with all the data from the step 7.
CoA is triggered if needed according to Authorization Policy configured.
Configure Qualys Cloud and Scanner
Caution: Qualys configuration in this document is done for the lab purposes, please consult with Qualys engineers for design considerations
Step 1. Deploy Qualys Scanner
Qualys scanner can be deployed from OVA file. Login to Qualys cloud and navigate to Scans > Appliances and select New > Virtual Scanner Appliance
Select Download Image Only and pick appropriate distribution
To get Activation Code you can go to Scans > Appliances and select New > Virtual Scanner Appliance and select I Have My Image
After entering scanner name you are given Authorization Code which you will use later.
Step 2. Configure Qualys Scanner
Deploy OVA on the virtualization platform of your choice. Once done, configure those settings:
Set up network (LAN)
WAN interface settings (if you are using two interfaces)
Proxy settings (if you are using proxy)
Personalize this scanner
Afterwards scanner connects to Qualys and downloads the latest software and signatures.
To verify the scanner is connected you can navigate to Scans > Appliances.
Green connected sign on the left indicates that scanner is ready, you can also see LAN IP, WAN IP, version of Scanner and Signatures.
Configure ISE
Though you have configured Qualys Scanner and Cloud, you still have to tune Cloud settings to make sure integration with ISE works fine. Note, it should be done before you configure adapter through GUI, as the knowledgebase containing CVSS scoring is downloaded after the adapter is configured for the first time.
Step 1. Tune Qualys Cloud Settings for Integration with ISE
Enable CVSS Scoring at Vulnerability Management > Reports > Setup > CVSS > Enable CVSS Scoring
Ensure that user credentials used in adapter configuration have manager privileges. Select your user from the left top corner and click on User Profile. You should have Manager rights in the User Role.
Ensure that IP addresses/subnets of endpoints that require Vulnerability Assessment are added to Qualys at Vulnerability Management > Assets > Host Assets > New > IP Tracked Hosts
Step 2. Enable TC-NAC Services
Enable TC-NAC Services under Administration > Deployment > Edit Node. Check Enable Threat Centric NAC Service checkbox.
Note: There can be only one TC-NAC Node per Deployment.
Step 3. Configure Qualys Adapter Connectivity to ISE VA Framework
Navigate to Administration > Threat Centric NAC > Third Party Vendors > Add. Click on Save.
When Qualys Instance transitions to Ready to configure state, click on Ready to configure option in the Status.
REST API host should be the one you use for Qualys Cloud, where your account is located. In this example - qualysguard.qg2.apps.qualys.com
Account should be the one with Manager privileges, click on Next.
ISE downloads information about Scanners which are connected to Qualys Cloud, you can configure PSN to Scanner Mapping on this page. It ensures that selected scanner is picked based on PSN which authorizes the endpoint.
Advanced settings are well documented in ISE 2.1 Admin Guide, link can be found in the References section of this document. Click on Next and Finish. Qualys Instance transitions to Active state and knowledge base download starts.
Note: There can be only one Qualys instance per deployment.
Step 4. Configure Authorization Profile to trigger VA Scan
Navigate to Policy > Policy Elements > Results > Authorization > Authorization Profiles. Add new profile. Under Common Tasks select Vulnerability Assessment checkbox.
On-Demand scan interval should be selected according to your network design.
Authorization Profile contains those av-pairs:
cisco-av-pair = on-demand-scan-interval=48
cisco-av-pair = periodic-scan-enabled=0
cisco-av-pair = va-adapter-instance=796440b7-09b5-4f3b-b611-199fb81a4b99
They are sent to network devices within Access-Accept packet, although the real purpose of them is to tell MNT Node that Scan should be triggered. MNT instructs TC-NAC node to communicate with Qualys Cloud.
Step 5. Configure Authorization Policies
Configure Authorization Policy to use the new Authorization Profile configured in step 4. Navigate to Policy > Authorization > Authorization Policy, locate Basic_Authenticated_Access rule and click on Edit. Change the Permissions from PermitAccess to the newly created Standard VA_Scan. This causes a Vulnerability Scan for all users. Click on Save.
Create Authorization Policy for Quarantined machines. Navigate to Policy > Authorization > Authorization Policy > Exceptions and create an Exception Rule. Click on Conditions > Create New Condition (Advanced Option) > Select Attribute, scroll down and select Threat. Expand the Threat attribute and select Qualys-CVSS_Base_Score. Change the operator to Greater Than and enter a value according to your Security Policy. Quarantine authorization profile should give limited access to the vulnerable machine.
Verify
Identity Services Engine
The first connection triggers VA Scan. When the scan is finished, CoA Reauthentication is triggered to apply new policy if it is matched.
In order to verify which vulnerabilities were detected, navigate to Context Visibility > Endpoints. Check per endpoints Vulnerabilities with the Scores given to it by Qualys.
When selecting particular endpoint, more details about each Vulnerability appears, including Title and CVEID's.
In Operations > TC-NAC Live Logs, you can see Old vs New authorization policies applied and details on CVSS_Base_Score.
Note: Authorization conditions are done based on CVSS_Base_Score, which equals to the highest Vulnerability Score detected on the endpoint.
Qualys Cloud
When the VA Scan is triggered by TC-NAC Qualys queues the Scan, it can be viewed at Scans > Scans
 Afterwards it transitions to Running, meaning Qualys cloud has instructed the Qualys Scanner to perform actual scanning
 While the Scanner performs the Scan, you should see "Scanning..." sign in the top right corner of the Qualys Guard
Once the Scan is done it transitions to Finished state. You can view results at Scans > Scans, select required scan and click on View Summary or View Results.
In the Report itself you can see Detailed Results, where detected Vulnerabilities are shown.
Troubleshoot
Debugs on ISE
In order to enable debugs on ISE navigate to Administration > System > Logging > Debug Log Configuration, select TC-NAC Node and change the Log Level va-runtime and va-service component to DEBUG
Logs to be checked - varuntime.log. You can tail it directly from ISE CLI:

ISE21-3ek/admin# show logging application varuntime.log tail

Typical Issues
Issue 1. ISE gets Vulnerability Report with CVSS_Base_Score of 0.0 and CVSS_Temporal_Score of 0.0, while Qualys Cloud report contains Vulnerabilities detected.
Problem:
While checking the Report from Qualys Cloud you can see detected Vulnerabilities, however on ISE you do not see them.
Debugs seen in vaservice.log:
2016-06-02 08:30:10,323 INFO   [SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor-2][] cpm.va.service.processor.AdapterMessageListener -:::::- Endpoint Details sent to IRF is {"C0:4A:00:15:75:C8":[{"vulnerability":{"CVSS_Base_Score":0.0,"CVSS_Temporal_Score":0.0},"time-stamp":1464855905000,"title":"Vulnerability","vendor":"Qualys"}]}
Solution:
The reason for cvss score being zero is either that it has no vulnerabilities or the cvss scoring was not enabled in Qualys Cloud before you configure the adapter through UI. Knowledgebase containing cvss scoring feature enabled is downloaded after the adapter is configured first time. You have to ensure that CVSS Scoring was enabled before, adapter instance was created on ISE. It can be done under Vulnerability Management > Reports > Setup > CVSS > Enable CVSS Scoring
Issue 2. ISE does not get results back from the Qualys Cloud, even though correct Authorization Policy was hit.
Problem:
Corrected Authorization Policy was matched, which should trigger VA Scan. Despite that fact no scan is done.

Solution:
Qualys Cloud indicates that ip address of the endpoint is not eligible for the Scanning, please ensure you have added ip address of the endpoint to Vulnerability Management > Assets > Host Assets > New > IP Tracked Hosts
