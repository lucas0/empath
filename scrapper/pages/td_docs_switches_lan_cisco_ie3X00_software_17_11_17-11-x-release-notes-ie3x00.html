Figure 1. IE3300 Switch Label


Startup Config is Always Read from Flash
Beginning in Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10.1, the startup configuration is always read from flash. The latest configuration is available only in flash when you save the running config, irrespective of the booted media (for example, flash, sdflash, or usbflash ) and the boot mode (install or bundle).

Note
Also beginning in the Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10.1, you can configure Cisco Catalyst embedded switches to use USB Flash as the primary boot device. See the Cisco IOS XE Migration Guide for IIoT Switches on cisco.com.
SMU Installation: Boot in Install Mode
Software Maintenance Upgrade (SMU) installation has been supported in both bundle boot and install mode. However, beginning in Cisco IOS XE 17.9.1, the switch must be booted up in install mode to support SMU installation.
SMU installation stops if the device is booted up in bundle mode. If the device is booted up in install mode, SMU installation continues to work as before.
IE3400: Hardware Changes may Require Action
Some hardware components on the Cisco Catalyst IE3400 Rugged Series and Cisco Catalyst IE3400 Heavy Duty Series switches have changed. The changes, which are automatically handled by the IOS XE software, do not affect switch functionality or the ordering process. New units shipped after May 31, 2022 have the hardware change.
However, you may need to upgrade the software, depending on which base switch and expansions module you have, as shown in the following table.

Note
For detailed information about affected hardware versions, supported software releases, and instructions for different scenarios, see Field Notice Title on Cisco.com.
If you have...
Then...
Older versions (shipped before May 31, 2022) of the base switch and expansion module
No action is required.
Newer versions (shipped after May 31, 2022) of the base switch and expansion module
Deploy one of the supported releases of IOS-XE. Refer to Field Notice Title on Cisco.com for details that are appropriate to your deployment.
Newer version of the base switch with an older version of the expansion module
Older version of the base switch with a newer version of the expansion module
FPGA Profile
FPGA Profile is supported in Cisco IOS XE release 17.8 and later. In a Cisco IOS XE upgrade from an earlier release that does not support FPGA Profile, for example, an upgrade from Cisco IOS XE 17.7.1 to 17.8.1, the default FPGA Profile is installed. Any features controlled by FPGA Profile that are configured in the switch running the earlier release and that are not included in the default profile will be rejected.

Note
This feature is supported for Cisco Catalyst IE3400 Rugged Series Switches and Cisco Catalyst IE3400 Heavy-Duty Series Switches.
For example, CTS IPv6 is not supported in the default profile, so CTS IPv6 configurations are rejected during bootup after the upgrade. Similarly, after a Cisco IOS XE upgrade where the cts-ipv6 profile is loaded, existing PRP configurations are rejected upon bootup.
To keep the existing profile and feature configurations after an upgrade:
After booting the switch, selected the required FPGA Profile as described in "Changing the FPGA Profile", in System Management Configuration Guide, Cisco Catalyst IE3x00 Rugged, IE3400 Heavy Duty, and ESS3300 Series Switches, chapter "Configuring FPGA Profile".
Do not copy running-config to startup-config or write memory.
Reload the switch.
The required feature configurations will not be discarded because they are supported by the selected profile.
PoE Limitation on IE3x00
Even when using power supplies that can provide up to a supported maximum (for example, 170W, 240W, or 480W) for the PoE budget, the PoE budget for the IE3x00 defaults to 125W regardless of the power supplies used. You can configure the power budget to use the maximum.

Note
Before changing the power budget, the minimum power requirements for the switch need to be considered as well. Please refer to the data sheet for your switch for more details.
The attached power supply powers the IE3x00 switch operation as well as PoE power. When increasing the maximum PoE budget, you must subtract the power draw of the IE3x00 switch from the capacity of the attached power supply. You do so to prevent the IE3x00 switch from overdrawing the capacity of the attached power supply. For example, the IE3400 switch with an expansion module supports a maximum PoE budget of 480W. The IE3400-8P2S with an attached IEM-3400-8P draws 67W. With a 480W capacity power supply, the maximum you should configure the PoE budget is (480W-67W) 413W.
To use the power supply's maximum supported wattage for the PoE budget, configure the power supply max wattage in global configuration mode as follows:
Verify the maximum amount that the power supplies support for the PoE budget.
Subtract the operating power of the IE3x00 switch according to its datasheet from the maximum capacity of the power supply. This is your max PoE budget.
Enter power inline max max-wattage to increase the PoE budget based on the power supplies used.
max-wattage is the maximum available PoE power.
IE3200 and IE 3300 with 10Mbps or 100Mbps speed in Half-Duplex Mode
CRC errors were observed on the IE3200 and IE3300 platforms when the switch is configured with 10Mbps or 100Mbps speed in half-duplex mode.
As a workaround, configure no ptp enable on the half-duplex interface. This improves ingress and egress latencies considerably and ensures that there are no late collisions (and therefore, no CRC errors).
The issue and workaround apply to Cisco IOS XE releases 17.3.5 and later.

Upgrading the Switch Software
This section covers the various aspects of upgrading or downgrading the device software.

Note
See the Cisco IOS XE Migration Guide for IIoT Switches for the latest information about upgrading and downgrading switch software.
Finding the Software Version
The package files for the Cisco IOS XE software can be found on the system board flash device flash (flash:) or external SDFlash (sdflash:).
You can use the show version privileged EXEC command to see the software version that is running on your switch.

Note
Although the show version output always shows the software image running on the switch, the model name shown at the end of this display is the factory configuration and does not change if you upgrade the software license.
You can also use the dir filesystem: privileged EXEC command to see the names and versions of other software images that you might have stored in flash memory.
Software Images 17.11.x
The following table provides the filenames for the IOS XE 17.11.x software image for Cisco Catalyst IE3x00 Rugged, IE3400 Heavy Duty, and ESS3300 Series Switches and Cisco Catalyst IE3100 Rugged Series Switches.

Automatic Boot Loader Upgrade
When you upgrade from the existing release on your switch to a later or newer release for the first time, the boot loader may be automatically upgraded, based on the hardware version of the switch. If the boot loader is automatically upgraded, it will take effect on the next reload.
For subsequent Cisco IOS XE releases, if there is a new bootloader in that release, it may be automatically upgraded based on the hardware version of the switch when you boot up your switch with the new image for the first time.

Caution
Do not power cycle your switch during the upgrade.
Scenario
Automatic Boot Loader Response
If you boot Cisco IOS XE the first time
Boot loader may be upgraded to version "8.1.2" for IE3x00 and ESS-3300.
Checking Bootloader upgrade...
…
Bootloader upgrade successful
Software Installation Commands

Note
For the install command to be successful, it is recommended to have a minimum of free space that is twice the size of the image in flash. If there is not enough space available in flash, you are advised to free up space in flash either by issuing the install remove inactive command or to manually clean up the flash by removing unwanted core files or any other files that occupy a large amount of space in flash.
Summary of Software Installation Commands for Install Mode
To install and activate the specified file, and to commit changes to be persistent across reloads—install add file filename [ activate commit]
add file tftp: filename
Copies the install file package from a remote location to the device and performs a compatibility check for the platform and image versions.
activate [ auto-abort-timer]
Activates the file, and reloads the device. The auto-abort-timer keyword automatically rolls back image activation.
commit
Makes changes persistent over reloads.
remove
Deletes all unused and inactive software installation files.
Licensing
This section provides information about the licensing packages for features available on Cisco Catalyst IE3x00 Rugged, IE3400 Heavy Duty, and ESS3300 Series Switches and Cisco Catalyst IE3100 Rugged Series Switches.
License Types
The following license types are available:
Permanent: for a license level, and without an expiration date.
Evaluation: a license that is not registered.

Note
Evaluation licenses are only used in Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.1. Starting with Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.2, Evaluation licenses are no longer used by Smart Licensing.
Term: a time-based license for a three, five, or seven year period.
License Levels - Usage Guidelines
Base licenses (Network Advantage) are ordered and fulfilled only with a permanent license type.
Add-on licenses (DNA Essentials, DNA Advantage) are ordered and fulfilled only with a term license type.
An add-on license level is included when you choose a network license level. If you use DNA features, renew the license before term expiry, to continue using it, or deactivate the add-on license and then reload the switch to continue operating with the base license capabilities.
Evaluation licenses cannot be ordered. They are not tracked via Cisco Smart Software Manager and expire after a 90-day period. Evaluation licenses can be used only once on the switch and cannot be regenerated. Warning system messages about an evaluation license expiry are generated only 275 days after expiration and every week thereafter. An expired evaluation license cannot be reactivated after reload.

Note
Evaluation licenses are only used in Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.1. Starting with Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.2, Evaluation licenses are no longer used by Smart Licensing.
Network Essentials license is the default license. It is permanent. A connection to the Smart Licensing server is not required if the IE switch will be deployed with a Network Essentials license.
Smart Licensing Using Policy
An enhanced version of Smart Licensing is available, with the overarching objective of providing a licensing solution that does not interrupt the operations of your network, rather, one that enables a compliance relationship to account for the hardware and software licenses you purchase and use.
With this licensing model, you do not have to complete any licensing-specific operations, such as registering or generating keys before you start using the software and the licenses that are tied to it. Only export-controlled and enforced licenses require Cisco authorization before use. License usage is recorded on your device with timestamps, and the required workflows can be completed at a later date.
Multiple options are available for license usage reporting – this depends on the topology you implement. You can use the Cisco Smart Licensing Utility (CSLU) Windows application, or report usage information directly to Cisco Smart Software Manager (CSSM). A provision for offline reporting for air-gapped networks, where you download usage information and upload to CSSM, is also available.
Starting with this release, Smart Licensing Using Policy is automatically enabled on the device. This is also the case when you upgrade to this release.
By default, your Smart Account and Virtual Account in CSSM is enabled for Smart Licensing Using Policy.

Note
Starting with Cisco IOS XE Amsterdam 17.3.2, with the introduction of Smart Licensing Using Policy, even if you configure a hostname for a product instance or device, only the Unique Device Identifier (UDI) is displayed.
This change in the display can be observed in all licensing utilities and user interfaces where the hostname was displayed in earlier releases. It does not affect any licensing functionality. There is no workaround for this limitation.
The licensing utilities and user interfaces that are affected by this limitation include only the following: Cisco Smart Software Manager (CSSM), Cisco Smart License Utility (CSLU), and Smart Software Manager On-Prem (SSM On-Prem).
Caveats
Caveats describe unexpected behavior in Cisco IOS XE releases. Caveats listed as open in a prior release are carried forward to the next release as either open or resolved.
