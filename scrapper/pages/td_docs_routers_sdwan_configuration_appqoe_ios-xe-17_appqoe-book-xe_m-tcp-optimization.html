TCP Optimization
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.1a
TCP optimization support extended to Cisco ISR4221, Cisco ISRv, and Cisco 1000 Series Integrated Services Routers. See Supported Platforms for more information.
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Release 16.12.1d
This feature optimizes TCP data traffic by decreasing any round-trip latency and improving throughput.
TCP optimization fine tunes the processing of TCP data traffic to decrease round-trip latency and improve throughput.
This article describes optimizing TCP traffic in service-side VPNs on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
Optimizing TCP traffic is especially useful for improving TCP traffic performance on long-latency links, such as transcontinental links and the high-latency transport links used by VSAT satellite communications systems. TCP optimization can also improve the performance of SaaS applications.
With TCP optimization, a router acts as a TCP proxy between a client that is initiating a TCP flow and a server that is listening for a TCP flow, as illustrated in the following figure:
The figure shows two routers acting as proxies. Router A is the proxy for the client, and is called the client proxy. Router B is the proxy for the server, called the server proxy. Without TCP optimization, the client establishes a TCP connection directly to the server. When you enable TCP optimization on the two routers, Router A terminates the TCP connection from the client and establishes a TCP connection with Router B. Router B then establishes a TCP connection to the server. The two routers cache the TCP traffic in their buffers to ensure that the traffic from the client reaches the server without allowing the TCP connection to time out.
It is recommended that you configure TCP optimization on both the routers, the router closer to the client and the router closer to the server. This configuration is sometimes called a dual-ended proxy. It is possible to configure TCP optimization only on the router closer to the client, a scenario called single-ended proxy, but this configuration is not recommended because the TCP optimization process is compromised. TCP is a bidirectional protocol and operates only when connection-initiation messages (SYNs) are acknowledged by ACK messages in a timely fashion.
If both the client and the server are connected to the same router, no TCP optimization is performed.
To use TCP optimization, first enable the feature on the router. Then define which TCP traffic to optimize. Before you configure TCP optimization, to start with the configuration transaction, you can use the following command such as,
ntp server 198.51.241.229 source GigabitEthernet1 version 4

TCP Optimization Configuration Examples
Topology and Roles
For a branch, the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device acts as both controller and service-node.
Data Center
For a data center, the controller and service-node roles are performed by separate Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. This optimizes performance and enables handling more traffic.
The service-node is an external node that has control connections to vManage to receive configurations.

Note
The service-node Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device must have an underlay connection to the controller on the global VRF to establish an appnav tunnel.

Cisco Catalyst 8200 Series Edge Platforms
Cisco Catalyst 8300 Series Edge Platforms
TCP optimization is not supported on DNS traffic and C8200L platforms.
Minimum Resource Requirements
The platforms must have a minimum of 8 GB of DRAM.
The platforms must have four or more data cores, with the exception of Cisco 4321 Integrated Services Router (ISR 4321), which is supported in spite of having fewer than four data cores.
The Cisco CSR1000V and Cisco Catalyst 8000V platforms must have eight data cores.
Limitations and Restrictions
TCP optimization in Cisco SD-WAN uses the Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip Propagation Time (BBR) algorithm for congestion control. Because BBR is used, if clients request for Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), the proxy disables it because it is not supported.
TCP Optimization Configuration Examples
Example: Configure Service Insertion using CLI – Branch Router
This example configures a branch Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device to act as controller and service-node.

Note
By default, subnet 192.168.1.1/30 and 192.0.2.1/30 used for VPG0 and VPG1 (UTD) and 192.168.2.1/24 used for VPG2 (APPQOE) is configured through Cisco vManage. Use any RFC 1918 subnet for Transport and Service VPN configurations other than these netmask.

Example: Configure Service Insertion Using Cisco vManage – Branch Router
For a branch, the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device acts as both controller and service-node.
This example configures the branch Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device as controller and service-node.

Note
When enabling the AppQoE feature on a device through Cisco vManage, ensure that you remove any Virtual Port Groups (VPG) that already have service-insertion appqoe in their configuration and have an IP address that differs from the one you are pushing through vManage. Enabling AppQoE on a device that has an existing service-insertion appqoe configuration on a VPG could lead to a conflict in configurations. This conflict may result in the AppQoE status remaining indeterminate.
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Templates.
Click Feature Templates.

Note
In Cisco vManage Release 20.7.x and earlier releases Feature Templates is called Feature.
Choose a device from one of the device options listed.
Under Other Templates in the right pane, choose AppQoE.
Enter a name and description for the template.
Click the Controller option.
Enter the following details for the controller option:
Controller IP: Corresponds to the appnav-controller value that would be configured by the service-insertion appnav-controller-group command when configuring by CLI.
Internal: Check this check box.
Service Node IP: Corresponds to the service-node value that would be configured by the service-insertion service-node-group command when configuring by CLI.
Click Save.
Add the feature template that was created in a previous step, to a device template page. In the AppQoE drop-down menu, choose the name of the feature template. Add the AppQoE template you created in the previous step following the steps below.
