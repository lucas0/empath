Features and Benefits
Evolve your network
Deliver outstanding scale with high-density Circuit Emulation technology, Ethernet and Optical Transport Network (OTN) capabilities, over a packet-based network (MPLS/Flexible Label Switch Path (FlexLSP)).
Circuit Emulation
Migrate your native TDM traffic over to a packet network infrastructure with the NCS 4200 Series’ circuit emulation technology, while both supporting existing TDM service requirements and eliminating the need for your legacy PDH and SONET/SDH equipment.
Cost and power efficiency
Reduce the space and power required by existing solutions by up to 90%, by seamlessly migrating older networks and services that rely on TDM Digital Cross Connect Systems (DCS) and Add-drop Multiplexers (ADMs) to an IP network.
Multilayer Management
Designed with software-defined networking (SDN), network functions virtualization (NFV), and multilayer management in mind, the Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPN-M) provides simplified, converged, end-to-end lifecycle management across an optical and Carrier Ethernet infrastructure.
