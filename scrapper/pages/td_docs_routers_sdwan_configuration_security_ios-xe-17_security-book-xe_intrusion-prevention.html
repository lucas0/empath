This feature enables Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) or Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for branch offices on Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN. It is delivered using a virtual image on Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices. This feature uses the Snort engine to provide IPS and IDS functionalities.
Snort is an open source network IPS that performs real-time traffic analysis and generates alerts when threats are detected on IP networks. It can also perform protocol analysis, content searching or matching, and detect a variety of attacks and probes (such as buffer overflows).

Overview of Intrusion Prevention System
The IPS feature works in the network intrusion detection and prevention mode that provides IPS or IDS functionalities. In the network intrusion detection and prevention mode, the engine performs the following actions:
Monitors network traffic and analyzes against a defined rule set.
Performs attack classification.
Invokes actions against matched rules.
Based on your requirements, you can enable Snort either in IPS or IDS mode. In IDS mode, the engine inspects the traffic and reports alerts, but does not take any action to prevent attacks. In IPS mode, in addition to intrusion detection, actions are taken to prevent attacks.
IPS the traffic and reports events to vManage or an external log server (if configured). External third-party monitoring tools, which supports Snort logs, can be used for log collection and analysis.
Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN IPS Solution
The Snort IPS solution consists of the following entities:
Snort sensor: Monitors the traffic to detect anomalies based on the configured security policies (that includes signatures, statistics, protocol analysis, and so on) and sends alert messages to the Alert/Reporting server. The Snort sensor is deployed as a security virtual image on the router.
Signature store: Hosts the Cisco Talos signature packages that are updated periodically. vManage periodically downloads signature packages to the Snort sensors. You can modify the time interval to check for and download signature updates in Administration > Settings > IPS Signature Update (in releases through Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1) or Administration > Settings > UTD Snort Subscriber Signature (in releases beginning with Cisco vManage Release 20.10.1).

Note
Options for downloading UTD signature packages out of band from Cisco.com and uploading them to Cisco SD-WAN Manager or a remote server and options for custom signatures are available from Cisco vManage Release 20.10.1 and Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10.1a.
Alert/Reporting server: Receives alert events from the Snort sensor. Alert events generated by the Snort sensor can either be sent to vManage or an external syslog server or to both vManage and an external syslog server. vManage events can be viewed in Monitor > Events. No external log servers are bundled with the IPS solution.

Description
IPS Custom Signature and Offline Updates
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.10.1
This feature lets you download IPS signature packages for the Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) out-of-band from Cisco SD-WAN Manager and upload these packages to Cisco SD-WAN Manager or a remote server. Cisco SD-WAN Manager then distributes these IPS signature packages to the devices on your network. This feature also lets you upload a custom signature rules file to Cisco SD-WAN Manager or a remote server, which Cisco SD-WAN Manager then distributes and appends to the existing IPS signature package rules.
Information About IPS Custom Signature and Offline Updates
Prerequisites for IPS Custom Signature and Offline Updates
Configure IPS Custom Signature and Offline Updates
Information About IPS Custom Signature and Offline Updates
Beginning with Cisco vManage Release 20.10.1 and Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10.1a, if Cisco SD-WAN Manager does not have an internet connection, you can download IPS signature packages locally and either upload them directly to Cisco SD-WAN Manager or to a remote server or servers to which your devices have network access. Cisco SD-WAN Manager does not need to have network access to the remote servers. You also can append custom signature rules to the current Cisco TALOS signature rules file. This custom signature rules file can also be uploaded to Cisco SD-WAN Manager or to a remote server or servers to which your devices have network access.
The filename of an IPS signature package has the format shown in this example, where the numbers represent the Snort engine version and the version of the IPS signature package: UTD-STD-SIGNATURE-29181-105-S.pkg. The first number is the Snort engine version and the second number is the version of the IPS signature package for the Snort engine. In this example, the filename represents the 105th release of the IPS signature package for the 2.9.18.1 Snort engine.
Prerequisites for IPS Custom Signature and Offline Updates
To download the signatures, Cisco SD-WAN Manager requires access to the following domains using port 443:
api.cisco.com
cloudsso.cisco.com
dl.cisco.com
dl1.cisco.com
dl2.cisco.com
dl3.cisco.com
download-ssc.cisco.com
If you enable IPS Signatures and choose the Remote Server or Local option, you must download a separate IPS signature package for each Snort engine version that is used in your network.
You can download the latest IPS signature packages for your Snort engines from the following page. The latest IPS signature package for each Snort engine is shown at the top left corner of this page.
https://software.cisco.com/download/home/284389362/type/286285292/release/
To determine the version of the Snort engine or engines that you are using, you can use the show utd engine standard version command or check the UTD package filename.
For example, in the following output of the show utd engine standard version command, the Snort engine version number is 2.9.18.1, so you should use the latest 29181 IPS signature package release:
Device# show utd engine standard version
IOS-XE Recommended UTD Version: 1.0.6_SV2.9.18.1_XE17.9 
IOS-XE Supported UTD Regex: ^1\.0\.([0-9]+)_SV(.*)_XE17.3$
Similarly, in the following UTD package filename, the Snort engine version number is 2.9.18.1, so again you should use the latest 29181 IPS signature package release:
secapp-utd.17.09.01a.1.0.6_SV2.9.18.1_XE17.9.x86_64.tar
The IPS signature packages are updated approximately every 24 to 72 hours. If you enable IPS Signatures and choose the Remote Server or Local option, we recommend that you check for new IPS signature packages daily to ensure that the IPS signature packages that you are using are up to date.
If you use an IPS signature package file on a remote sever and the filename that Cisco SD-WAN Manager points to includes the IPS signature package version, you must update the filename that Cisco SD-WAN Manager points to each time a new IPS signature package is uploaded to the remote server, for each Snort engine version used.
Configure IPS Custom Signature and Offline Updates
Minimum supported releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10.1a, Cisco vManage Release 20.10.1
Use the procedure that this section describes to update IPS signatures and custom signature rules.
Before you begin, if you are using a remote server, we recommend that you perform either of the following actions for each Snort engine version that you are using to avoid needing to manually update the path in Cisco SD-WAN Manager each time a new IPS signature package is uploaded to the remote server:
Remove the signature package version number (keeping the Snort engine version number) from the filename that Cisco SD-WAN Manager points to and override this filename on the remote server each time a new IPS signature package is uploaded for this Snort engine version.
For example, rename UTD-STD-SIGNATURE-29181-105-S.pkg to UTD-STD-SIGNATURE-29181-S.pkg on the remote server and have Cisco SD-WAN Manager point to this filename. Then override this filename each time a new IPS signature package for the 2.9.18.1 Snort engine is uploaded to the remove server. Perform a similar action for each Snort engine version that is used.
Use a symbolic link (symlink) on the remote server and update it to point to the latest IPS signature package each time a new IPS signature package is uploaded for a Snort engine version. In this case, have Cisco SD-WAN Manager point to this symbolic link.
For example, have a symbolic link called UTD-STD-SIGNATURE-29181-S.pkg that points to UTD-STD-SIGNATURE-29181-105-S.pkg on the remote server and have Cisco vManage point to this symbolic link. Then update the file that this symbolic link points to each time a new IPS signature package for the 2.9.18.1 Snort engine is uploaded to the remote server. Perform a similar action for each Snort engine version that is used.
From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Administration > Settings.
Click Edit in the UTD Snort Subscriber Signature row.
In the IPS Signature Download Interval Hours and Minute fields, enter how often Cisco SD-WAN Manager attempts to download new IPS signature packages from Cisco.com.
This interval is also used for how often Cisco SD-WAN Manager has the devices attempt to download the latest IPS signature package or packages and custom signature rules file from Cisco SD-WAN Manager or the remote server or servers.
You can enter an interval from 2 hours to 24 hours. The default interval is 24 hours.
To enable the IPS signature package update, enable the IPS Signatures option, then click one of the following radio buttons to specify how the IPS signature packages are distributed by Cisco SD-WAN Manager:
Cisco.com: Downloads IPS signature packages to Cisco SD-WAN Manager from Cisco.com, then causes the devices to download the IPS signature packages from Cisco SD-WAN Manager. This option requires that Cisco SD-WAN Manager has an internet connection.
In the Username and Password fields, enter your Cisco Connection Online username and password.
Remote Server: Devices download the IPS signature packages from one or more remote servers over a local network connection, not from Cisco SD-WAN Manager. We recommend that you use this option to avoid Cisco SD-WAN Manager scaling issues.
From the Select Remote Server drop-down list, choose a remote server (you can use the Search field to find a server), or click Add Remote Server to configure a new remote server.
If you click Add Remote Server, perform these actions:
Enter information for this server in the following fields:
