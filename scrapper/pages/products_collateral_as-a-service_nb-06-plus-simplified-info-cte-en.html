Challenges with traditional infrastructure buying model
Simplicity
Management complexity across siloed teams with too many tools that are difficult to integrate into the current operational model.
Scalability
Inability to scale up resources dynamically and cost-effectively or to decrease capacity when oversubscribed.
Security
Difficult to stay ahead of security issues, quickly address security incidents, and implement the latest features and technology.
Predictable cost
Struggle of managing operating expenditures while improving responsiveness, utilization, and capabilities as infrastructure demands grow.
Adopt new innovation
Upfront investment is required to bring new technology in-house and it restricts organizations from deploying applications dynamically as requirements change.
