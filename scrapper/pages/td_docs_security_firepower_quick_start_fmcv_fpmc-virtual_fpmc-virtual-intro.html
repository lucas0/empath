Memory and Resource Requirements
Each instance of the management center virtual requires a minimum resource allocation—memory, number of CPUs, and disk space—on the target platform to ensure optimal performance.

Important
When upgrading the management center virtual, check the latest Release Notes for details on whether a new release affects your environment. You may be required to increase resources to deploy the latest versions.
When you upgrade, you add the latest features and fixes that help improve the security capabilities and performance of your deployment.
Management Center Virtual Requires 28 GB RAM for Upgrade (6.6.0+)
The management center virtual platform has introduced a new memory check during upgrade. The management center virtual upgrades to Version 6.6.0+ will fail if you allocate less than 28 GB RAM to the virtual appliance.

Important
We recommend you do not decrease the default settings: 32 GB RAM for most of the management center virtual instances, 64 GB for the management center virtual 300 (FMCv300). To improve performance, you can always increase a virtual appliance’s memory and number of CPUs, depending on your available resources.
As a result of this memory check, we will not be able to support lower memory instances on supported platforms. See About Virtual Appliance Performance for important management center virtual upgrade information.
Management Center Virtual Initial Setup (6.5.0+)
Beginning with Version 6.5, the management center virtual has an improved initial setup experience that includes the following changes and enhancements:
DHCP on Management—DHCP is enabled by default mode on the management interface (eth0).
The management center virtual management interface is preconfigured to accept an IP4 or IPv6 address assigned by DHCP. Consult with your system administrator to determine what IP address your DHCP has been configured to assign to the management center virtual. In scenarios where no DHCP is available, the Secure Firewall Management Center (formerly Firepower Management Center) management interface uses the IPv4 address 192.168.45.45 or the IPv6 address, for example: 2001:db8::a111:b221:1:abca/96.
Web interface URL—The default URL for the management center virtual web interface has changed to https://<-IP>:<port>/ui/login.
Password reset—To ensure system security and privacy, the first time you log in to the management center you are required to change the admin password. When the Change Password wizard screen appears, you have two options: Enter a new password in the New Password and Confirm Password text boxes. The password must comply with the criteria listed in the dialog.
Network settings—The management center virtual now includes an install wizard to complete the initial setup:
Fully Qualified Domain Name—Accept the default value, if one is shown, or enter a fully qualified domain name (syntax <hostname>.<domain>) or host name.
Boot protocol for IPV4 or IPV6connection—Choose either DHCP or Static/Manual as the method of IP address assignment.
DNS Group—The default Domain Name Server group for the management center virtual is the Cisco Umbrella DNS.
NTP Group Servers—The default Network Time Protocol group is set to the Sourcefire NTP pools.
RAM Requirements—The recommended size of RAM is 32GB for the management center virtual.
FMCv300 for VMware—A new scaled management center virtual image is available on the VMware platform that supports managing up to 300 devices and has higher disk capacity.
Supported Platforms
The management center virtual can be deployed on the following platforms:
VMware vSphere Hypervisor (ESXi) — You can deploy the management center virtual as a guest virtual machine on VMware ESXi.

Hypervisor and Version Support
For hypervisor and version support, see Cisco Firepower Compatibility.
Management Center Virtual Licenses
The management center virtual License is a platform license, rather than a feature license. The version of virtual license you purchase determines the number of devices you can manage via the management center. For example, you can purchase licenses that enable you to manage two devices, 10 devices, 25 devices, or 300 devices.
About Management Center Feature Licenses
About Management Center Feature Licenses
You can license a variety of features to create an optimal System deployment for your organization. The management center allows you to manage these feature licenses and assign them to your devices.

Note
The management center manages feature licenses for your devices, but you do not need a feature license to use the management center.
Management Center feature licenses depend on your device type:
Smart Licenses are available for the threat defense and threat defense virtual devices.
Classic Licenses are available for 7000 and 8000 Series, ASA FirePOWER, and NGIPSv devices.
Devices that use Classic Licenses are sometimes referred to as Classic devices. A single management center can manage both Classic and Smart Licenses.
In addition to "right-to-use" feature licenses, many features require a service subscription. Right-to-use licenses do not expire, but service subscriptions require periodic renewal.
For detailed information about Smart vs. Classic licenses on each platform, see the Cisco Firepower System Feature Licenses document.
For answers to common questions about Smart Licensing, Classic licensing, right-to-use licenses, and service subscriptions, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about Licensing document.
About Virtual Appliance Performance
It is not possible to accurately predict throughput and processing capacity for virtual appliances. A number of factors heavily influence performance, such as the:
Amount of memory and CPU capacity of the host
Number of total virtual machines running on the host
Network performance, interface speed, and number of sensing interfaces deployed
Amount of resources assigned to each virtual appliance
Level of activity of other virtual appliances sharing the host
Complexity of policies applied to a virtual device
If the throughput is not satisfactory, adjust the resources assigned to the virtual appliances that share the host.
Each virtual appliance you create requires a certain amount of memory, CPUs, and hard disk space on the host. Do not decrease the default settings, as they are the minimum required to run the system software. However, to improve performance, you can increase a virtual appliance’s memory and number of CPUs, depending on your available resources.
The following table lists the supported management center virtual limits.

Maximum event rate (events per second) 5,000 12,000 eps
Management Center Virtual Default and Minimum Memory Requirements
All the management center virtual implementations now have the same RAM requirements: 32 GB recommended, 28 GB required (64 GB for the FMCv300). Upgrades to Version 6.6.0+ will fail if you allocate less than 28 GB to the virtual appliance. After upgrade, the health monitor will alert if you lower the memory allocation.
These new memory requirements enforce uniform requirements across all virtual environments, improve performance, and allow you to take advantage of new features and functionality. We recommend you do not decrease the default settings. To improve performance, you can increase a virtual appliance’s memory and number of CPUs, depending on your available resources.

Important
As of the Version 6.6.0 release, lower-memory instance types for cloud-based management center virtual deployments (AWS, Azure) are fully deprecated. You cannot create the new management center virtual instances using them, even for earlier versions. You can continue running existing instances.
The following table summarizes pre-upgrade requirements for lower-memory management center virtual deployments.
