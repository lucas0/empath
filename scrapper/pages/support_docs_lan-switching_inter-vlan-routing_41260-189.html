Introduction
This document describes how to configure Inter VLAN routing with Cisco Catalyst series switches.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Ensure that you meet these requirements before you attempt this configuration:
Knowledge of how to create VLANs
For more information, refer to Create Ethernet VLANs on Catalyst Switches.
Knowledge of how to create Trunk links
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
Catalyst 3850 that runs Cisco IOS® Software Release 16.12.7
Catalyst 4500 that runs Cisco IOS Software Release 03.09.00E
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Conventions

This configuration can also be used with these hardware and software versions:
Any Catalyst 3k/9k switch and later
Any Catalyst switch model, used as the access layer switch
Background Information
This document provides a sample configuration for Inter VLAN routing with a Catalyst 3850 series switch in a typical network scenario. The document uses two Catalyst 4500 series switch as Layer 2 (L2) switches that connect directly to the Catalyst 3850. The Catalyst 3850 configuration also has a default route for all traffic that goes to the Internet when the next hop points to a Cisco router. You can substitute the Internet Gateway with a firewall or other routers model.
Note: The configuration from the Cisco router is not relevant, so this document does not show the configuration.
In a switched network, VLANs separate devices into different collision domains and Layer 3 (L3) subnets. Devices within a VLAN can communicate with each other without the need for routing. Devices in separate VLANs require a routing device to communicate with each other.
L2-only switches require an L3 routing device to provide communication between VLANs. The device is either external to the switch or in another module on the same chassis. A new breed of switches incorporate routing capability within the switch. An example is the 3850. The switch receives a packet, determines that the packet belongs to another VLAN, and sends the packet to the appropriate port on the destination VLAN.
A typical network design segments the network based on the group or function to which the device belongs. For example, the engineering VLAN only has devices that relate to the engineering department, and the finance VLAN only has devices that relate to finance. If you enable routing, the devices in each VLAN can talk to one another without the need for all the devices to be in the same broadcast domain. Such a VLAN design also has an additional benefit. The design allows the administrator to restrict communication between VLANs with use of access lists. For example, you can use access lists to restrict the engineering VLAN from access to devices on the finance VLAN.
Refer to this video  that demonstrates how to configure the Inter VLAN routing on a Catalyst 3550 series switch for more information,  How To Configure Inter VLAN Routing On Layer 3 Switches .
Configure
In this section, you are presented with the information to configure the features described in this document.
Note: Use the Command Lookup Tool to find more information on the commands used here. This is an internal tool. Only registered Cisco users have access to tools like this and other internal information.
Network Diagram
This document uses this network setup:
In this diagram, a small sample network with the Catalyst 3850 provides Inter VLAN routing between the various segments. The Catalyst 3850 switch can act as an L2 device with the disablement of IP routing. In order to make the switch function as an L3 device and provide Inter VLAN routing, make sure that ip routing is enabled globally.
These are the three VLANs defined by the user:
VLAN 2 — User-VLAN
VLAN 3 — Server-VLAN
VLAN 10 — Mgmt-VLAN
The default gateway configuration on each server and host device must be the VLAN interface IP address that corresponds on the 3850. For example, for Servers, the default gateway is 10.1.3.1. The access layer switches, which are the Catalyst 4500, are trunked to the Catalyst 3850 switch.
The default route for the Catalyst 3850 points to the Cisco router, and this is used to route traffic destined for the Internet. Therefore, traffic for which the 3850 does not have a route in the routing table it is forwarded to the Cisco Router for additional process.
Practical Tips
Ensure that the native VLAN for an 802.1Q trunk is the same on both ends of the trunk link. If the native VLAN on one end of the trunk is different than the native VLAN on the other end, the traffic of the native VLANs on both sides cannot be transmitted correctly on the trunk. This failure to transmit correctly can imply some connectivity issues in your network.
Separate the management VLAN from the User or Server VLAN, as in this diagram. The management VLAN is different from the user or server VLAN. With this separation, any broadcast/packet storm that occurs in the user or server VLAN does not affect the management of switches.
Do not use VLAN 1 for management. All ports in Catalyst switches default to VLAN 1, and any devices that connect to ports that are not configured are in VLAN 1. The use of VLAN 1 for management can cause potential issues for the management of switches.
Use a Layer 3 (routed) port to connect to the default gateway port. In this example, you can easily replace a Cisco router with a firewall that connects to the Internet gateway router.
This example configures a static default route on the 3850 towards the Csco Router to reach the Internet. This setup is best if there is only one route to the Internet. Make sure to configure static routes, preferably summarized, on the gateway router for subnets that can be reached by the Catalyst 3850. This step is very important because this configuration does not use routing protocols.
If you have two Catalyst 3850 switches in your network, you can dually connect the access layer switches to the 3850 switches, and then run Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) between the switches to provide redundancy in the network.
If you need additional bandwidth for the uplink ports, you can configure EtherChannels. The EtherChannel also provides link redundancy in the case of a link failure.

Troubleshoot
Use this section to troubleshoot your configuration.
Troubleshoot Procedure
Use these instructions:
If you are not able to ping devices within the same VLAN, check the VLAN assignment of the source and destination ports to make sure that the source and destination are in the same VLAN.
In order to check the VLAN assignment, issue the show interface status command for Cisco IOS Software.
If the source and destination are not in the same switch, make sure that you have configured the trunks properly. In order to check the configuration, issue the show interfaces trunk command.
Also, check that the native VLAN matches on either side of the trunk link. Make sure that the subnet mask matches between the source and destination devices.
If you are not able to ping devices in different VLANs, make sure that you can ping the respective default gateway. (See Step 1.)
Also, make sure that the default gateway of the device points to the correct VLAN interface IP address. Ensure that the subnet mask matches.
If you are not able to reach the Internet, make sure that the default route on the 3850 points to the correct IP address, and that the subnet address matches the Internet Gateway router.
In order to check, issue the show ip interface interface-id command. Make sure that the Internet Gateway router has routes to the Internet and the internal networks.
