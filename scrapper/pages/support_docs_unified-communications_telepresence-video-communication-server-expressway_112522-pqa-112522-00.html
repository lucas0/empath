Q. Why can't I make calls from my VCS using URI dialing over DNS?
A. To use DNS to call endpoints that are not registered to the local VCS or one of its neighbors, you must:
Configure the VCS with details of at least one DNS server that it can query. This is done via System configuration > DNS.
Create and configure a DNS zone to look up the URIs to be dialed:
Software version X5 or later
Create a DNS zone (VCS configuration > Zones).
Create a search rule (VCS configuration > Search rules > Rules) and configure it with a Mode of either Any Alias, or Alias Pattern Match with a pattern string that matches the URIs to be dialed, and set the rule's Target zone to the new DNS zone.
Earlier software versions
Create a DNS zone and configure it with either an Always Match, or a Pattern Match that matches the URIs to be dialed. Zones are created and configured via VCS configuration > Zones.
For full information on zone configuration and URI dialing from the VCS using DNS, consult the VCS Administrator Guide.
