Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCvv68899 SIM card read errors on vedge-100M routers
Problem Description
Some Cisco vEdge 100M routers are unable to read the subscriber identification module (SIM) card due to a defective SIM card socket.
Background
Some Cisco vEdge 100M routers manufactured between August 2019 and June 2020 might contain a defective SIM card socket. The defective socket lacks a robust electrical path to the contacts on the SIM card and can result in SIM card read errors.
Problem Symptom
Affected routers will report problems registering the SIM card and show the SIM status as "not present". In some instances, the cellular LTE modem will go offline or disappear from the hardware inventory entirely. In order to view the SIM card status, enter the CLI command show cellular status on the router console or remotely via vManage as shown in this example:
show cellular status

Modem status      : Low Power Mode
SIM status        : Not present
Activation status : Not applicable
Radio mode        : No Service
Signal strength   : No signal
Network status    : Not registered
Last seen error   : SIM Read error
The WWAN Signal Strength LED on the router's front panel might display red (no signal) or might be off (LTE modem disabled).
Workaround/Solution
First, verify that the SIM card is good. Verify it functions correctly in a different Cisco vEdge 100M router, if one is available.
Some intermittent SIM card read failures might be corrected by reseating the SIM card in the SIM socket. Follow the instructions in the Hardware Installation Guide for vEdge Routers, Chapter: vEdge 100m Router for details on how to correctly install the SIM card into the SIM card socket.
If the problem cannot be corrected by reseating the SIM card, the router must be replaced. Cisco has created an upgrade program to provide replacements for vEdge100M routers affected by this problem. To order replacement vEdge routers via the upgrade program, first complete the instructions in the How to Identify Affected Products section in order to ensure your vEdge router qualifies. Then follow the link in the "Upgrade Program Information" section to request a replacement.
Notes:
Retain any accessories, which include the power cord and console cable, from the original unit since replacement units shipped via the upgrade program might not include those items.
Replacement routers received under the Cisco vEdge 100M upgrade program might contain eMMC 5.0 (embedded multi-media controller) NAND storage that requires a minimum of Cisco SD-WAN software version 18.4.4 or later. Consult Cisco field notice FN70564 for details and plan accordingly.
How To Identify Affected Products
A router must meet these conditions in order to qualify for replacement under the upgrade program:
It must be one of the Cisco vEdge router models listed in the Products Affected section of this notice.
The serial number must match one of the units manufactured during the affected time period between August 2019 and June 2020.
In order to determine if your particular router qualifies, enter the serial number into the Serial Number Validation Tool. The serial number of a Cisco vEdge 100M router can be located with one of these methods:
In Cisco vManage, choose Configuration > Devices. The device table lists the serial and model numbers of the routers in the network.
Enter the show hardware inventory command at the CLI prompt.
Review the physical label on the router in order to determine the serial number.
