Introduction
This document illustrates a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) network with ATM. Since VC-merge is not used, there is one VC allocated per route as determined by the prefix in the routing table.
Prerequisites
Requirements
There are no specific requirements for this document.
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
Cisco IOS® Software Release 12.0 or later is for MPLS on Guilder and Damme.
This setup uses one ATM switch that is used as the label switch router (LSR). In this example, it is a Catalyst 8540MSR. It can also be a LS1010. Cisco recommends software version WA4.8d or later on the LS1010. Any software on the 8540MSR is sufficient.
Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF) needs to be enabled on the routers that run MPLS/Tag switching. In this example, Guilder and Damme are Cisco 3600s. If a 7500 is used, ip cef distributed must be enabled.
Note: Although not a requirement, this document uses VPI 2, 3, or 4 for all Tag VCs in this example.
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Conventions
For more information on document conventions, refer to the Cisco Technical Tips Conventions.
Configure
In this section, you are presented with the information to configure the features described in this document.
Note: To find additional information on the commands used in this document, use the Command Lookup Tool (registered customers only) .
Network Diagram
This document uses this network setup:
Note: Loopback interfaces have been set on all routers/LSRs. They are not shown in the network diagram for the sake of simplicity.

show tag-switching atm-tdp bindings—Shows dynamic ATM tagging information.
show tag-switching int atm [int number] detail—Shows detailed per-interface tag switching information.
This output shows that the routing table is complete on Guilder:

On Capri (the ATM LSR), you can check the TVC to route binding with the show tag atm-tdp bindings command. One TVC is used for each routing table entry.
