Troubleshoot Smart Account Issues
Problem
A Smart Account is not visible in the Smart Account drop-down list after logging in to the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal.
This usually happens when there is no SD-WAN-capable attribute associated with the Smart Account.
Solution
Associate your Cisco DNA subscription with your Smart Account and Virtual Account.
For more information, see Workflow for Smart Account and Virtual Accounts for Provisioning the Controllers.
Contact Cisco SD-WAN Technical Support to associate the Smart Account with your Cisco DNA cloud subscription.
Troubleshoot Virtual Account Issues
Problem
The Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal displays an error that the Virtual Account is not SD-WAN capable.
This error indicates that a Cisco DNA subscription is not associated with the Virtual Account.
Solution
For customers with an enterprise agreement, automatic association of Virtual Accounts to an SD-WAN-capable attribute is not available.
To associate a Virtual Account with your Cisco DNA subscription as an enterprise customer, do the following:
Submit a cloud-controller provisioning request form through the Enterprise Agreement Workspace for the CloudOps team to provision the controllers.
Contact Cisco SD-WAN Technical Support to request that the desired Virtual Account become available on the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal.
After the desired Virtual Account is available on the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal, you can provision the controllers after providing the necessary enterprise agreement contract information.
For more information, see Smart Account and Virtual Accounts.
For more information, see Workflow for Smart Account and Virtual Accounts for Provisioning the Controllers.
If you are unable to associate your Virtual Account with your Cisco DNA subscription, contact Cisco SD-WAN Technical Support to associate the Virtual Account with your Cisco DNA cloud subscription.
