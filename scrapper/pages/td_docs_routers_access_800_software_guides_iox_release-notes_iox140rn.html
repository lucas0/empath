Overview
Cisco IOx provides uniform and consistent hosting capabilities for various types of apps across various Cisco platforms. This platform brings together Cisco IOS, the industry-leading networking operating system, and Linux, the leading open source platform. Linux-based applications can run on Cisco devices in the Cisco IOx framework, so using this platform, you can bring custom applications and interfaces to the network.
With Cisco IOx, developers can create a wide variety of IoT apps, such as data aggregation system and control systems.

Upgrading Cisco Fog Director
You can upgrade Cisco Fog Director Release 1.3 to Cisco Fog Director Release 1.4. When you do so, your current Cisco Fog Director data is migrated to the new release.
Procedure
1. Use the Cisco Fog Director 1.4 VM OVA to instantiate a Cisco Fog Director 1.4 VM.
Copy the file fd-util.deb from the /opt/cisco folder in the Cisco Fog Director 1.4 VM to a location of your choice in the Cisco Fog Director 1.3 VM.
2. Use an SSH client to access your Cisco Fog Director 1.3 VM and log in as the fogdir user.
3. On your Cisco Fog Director 1.3 VM, enter the following command to install the upgrade utility file:
[fogdir]# sudo dpkg -i d-util.deb
4. On your Cisco Fog Director 1.3 VM, take these actions to create an encrypted backup file that contains data and related information from your existing Cisco Fog Director:
a. Enter the following command, replacing backup-file with a name for the backup file. You can include a path with the file name if you want to place the backup file in a directory other than the directory from which you run this command. This command stops Cisco Fog Director release 1.3 if it is running.
[fogdir]# sudo fd-util export backup-file
b. When you see the “Encryption passphrase” prompt, enter a string of characters to be used for encryption and decryption of the backup file, and then press the Enter key.
Make sure to remember this passphrase.
c. When you see the “Enter the encryption passphrase again” prompt, re-enter the passphrase, and then press the Enter key.
The system creates the backup file and then displays the “Export completed” prompt.
5. Copy the backup file that you created to a client PC.
You can place the backup file in any location on the client PC and give it any name.
6. From a client PC, take these actions to obtain the VM OVA image for Cisco Fog Director 1.4:
a. Go to the following URL and click the IOx Fog Director Software link in the Select a Software Type box:
https://software.cisco.com/download/type.html?mdfid=286290097&catid=null
b. Click the Download button that corresponds to the.ova file that you want.
c. Follow the on-screen instructions to download the file to your local drive.
7. Use the VM OVA image that you downloaded to deploy a VM for Cisco Fog Director 1.4.
8. Take these actions to update Cisco Fog Director 1.4 with the information in the backup file that you create:
a. Start and log in to Cisco Fog Director release 1.4.
b. Click the Settings tab and then click the Settings sub-tab.
The Settings page displays.
c. In the Backup & Restore area on the Settings page, click the RESTORE button.
The Restore dialog box displays.
d. In the Decryption password field in the Restore dialog box, enter the passphrase that you created for the backup file.
e. Click SELECT BACKUP ARCHIVE in the Restore dialog box, and then navigate to and select the backup file that you copied to the client PC.
The system updates Cisco Fog Director 1.4 with the information in the backup file. This process can take some time, depending on how much data is in the backup file.
When the upgrade completes, the Cisco Fog Director 1.4 Log In page displays.
Limitations and Restrictions
IPv6 support is not available for apps.
Client ID configuration on IOS must be changed to dhclient format after migrating from the IOx 1.3.0 bundle image for Docker to IOx 1.4.0. Without changing this format, the Docker app will not get an IP address in bridge networking mode after the migration.
