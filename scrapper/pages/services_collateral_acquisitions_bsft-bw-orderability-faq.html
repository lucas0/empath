Q.  How do customers and partners get a Cisco.com user ID?
A.  Register for a Cisco.com user ID and create a Cisco.com profile. A Cisco.com user ID will give access to the tools that will help customers and partners view, renew, and manage contracts, and open a support case.
Q.  How do customers and partners associate the new Cisco Service Agreement Contract Number to their Cisco.com user ID?
A.  Customers will need to add their Cisco Service Agreement Contract Number to their user ID in the Cisco.com Profile Manager. From there, click the “Add Access” button, then select the “TAC and RMA case creation, Software Download, support tools, and entitled content on Cisco.com” radio button on the pop-up screen, and then click “Go” to manage your Service Contract online. If you have multiple service contract numbers, please separate them by commas.
Q.  What should customers or partners do if they have issues associating their new contract number to their Cisco.com user ID because the Bill-to name on the contract does not match the company name in the user’s profile?
A.  If a customer or partner is trying to associate their contract number to their Cisco.com user ID and they get an error message that says “The information on your Cisco Account is insufficient to definitely determine your company/organization” they should try to do one of the 2 options that they are presented with in
Figure 2:
●      If your Cisco account is incorrect, you can quickly resolve the problem by updating your profile, and then returning to this page to reprocess your request.
●      If your Cisco account is correct, you can submit your request as-is. You may be contacted for more information.
If those two options don't work for them, they should send an email to web-help-sr@cisco.com and include their Cisco.com user ID and contract number and a note that explains how the two different company names are related (subsidiary, merger, name change, etc.)
Figure 2.     Error Message when trying to associate a contract number to Cisco.com user ID
Q.  How can customers and partners that are using contract numbers to open a support case manage user access to their contracts?
A.  The Service Access Management Tool is an application that enables partners or customer administrators to determine which of their service contract numbers are present in Cisco.com user profiles. It is ideal for organizations that want to manage and associate multiple Cisco.com profiles.
By using the Service Access Management Tool, Cisco partners and customers can manage access to the services provided by their contracts (e.g., TAC support). This management can be done either using Bill to ID or contract number. To manage access by Bill to ID, the Bill to ID must be in an individual's Cisco.com profile and selected (enabled) for support access. This will ensure that all the contracts under the Bill to ID can be utilized for service. To manage access by contract number, a contract number must be in an individual's Cisco.com profile in order for that individual to be able to obtain service. Access the Service Access Management Tool, training, and related content for more information.
Q.  How can customers and partners see all cases that have been opened by their co-workers?
A.    All co-workers from a customer or partner should be able to see each other’s tickets in Support Case Manager as long as each user is associated to the contract, or if they are using Smart Accounts, each user has been added to the Smart Account and Virtual Accounts.   From Support Case Manager homepage follow these steps as shown in Figure 3.
Step 1.    Click ‘All Cases’ tab
Step 2.    For ‘Show’, select ‘Open, Draft, and Closed’
Step 3.    Set created date to ‘Last 90 days’
Step 4.    Apply Filters

Q.  Is there a way to have default distribution list pre-populated in the cc field in Support Case Manager?
A.  Yes, if a customer or partner would like to have an alias or a list of additional emails that are always copied on cases, the customer can set that in their Support Case Preferences. Click the "gear" icon on the Support Case Manager homepage.  In the Support Case Preferences pop-up box, select the “On” radial button for “Cases Notifications (Contact & CC List)” and then add a list of email addresses into the “CC List” box as shown in Figure 4.

Q.  Is it possible for customers and partners to assign Software Downloads access to their users?
A.  No, unfortunately there is no option at Cisco to assign Software Download only access to a Cisco.com
user ID.  If a customer or partner user requires access to download software they will need to associate the appropriate contract number with their Cisco.com user ID.
Q.  When opening a case in Support Case Manager using the “Products & Services” tile, customers and partners do not have an option under “Contact Information and Preference” to select “Virtual Space via Webex Teams.”  Is there a way that customers and partners can do this?
Q.  Once the case has been opened, the customer or partner can ask the support engineer to create a virtual space.  In addition, TAC connect bot now supports virtual case creation with the following syntax: /create-space <casenumber>. 
Q.  What support is provided through Cisco.com?
A.  Cisco.com includes interactive consulting tools, a database, and knowledge transfer resources. It also includes product documentation. Online troubleshooting tools and support resources include:

●    Peer-to-peer online forums, which enable sharing with others in your industry
●    Technical Support newsletter, which keeps you up to date and informed
Q.  How does the Cisco TAC prioritize support service requests?
A.  Cisco processes allow for customers to designate the severity of every service request reported. Priorities are based on the assigned severity levels.
Q.  What are the problem severity levels and associated responses?
A.  To help ensure that all service requests are reported in a standard format, Cisco has established the service request severity definitions indicated below. These severity levels may not be applicable across all market segments and technologies. Severity levels and escalation guidelines may also vary based on the existing applicable agreement.
●    Severity 1 (S1): shall mean reported Error(s) in covered products that causes all or substantially all of a system to be functionally inoperative severely affecting delivery to customers and requiring immediate corrective action, regardless of time of day or day of the week. Severity 1 means an existing network or environment is down or there is a critical impact to end user’s business operation. Customer and Cisco both will commit full-time resources 24 hours a day to resolve the situation.
●    Severity 2 (S2): shall mean reported Error(s) in covered products causing the loss of one or more major functions of the system, causing perceptible degradation or interruption of services delivery to customers or seriously affecting customer’s ability to operate, administer, or maintain their system and requiring immediate attention. Urgency is less than Severity 1 situation because of a lesser immediate or impending effect on system performance, customer’s operation and revenue. Severity 2 means operation of an existing network or environment is severely degraded or significant aspects of customer’s business operation are negatively impacted by unacceptable network or environment performance. Customer and Cisco both will commit full-time resources during standard business hours to resolve the situation.
●    Severity 3 (S3): shall mean reported Error(s) in covered products disabling specific noncritical functions of the system that do not significantly affect delivery services to customers. The lost or degraded functionality impairs customer’s ability to operate, administer, or maintain the system, but does not significantly affect services delivery to customers. Severity 3 means operational performance of the network or environment is impaired, although most business operations remain functional. Customer and Cisco both are willing to commit resources during standard business hours to restore service to satisfactory levels.
●      Severity 4 (S4): shall mean reported Error(s) in covered products which is an irritant only and has no significant effect on the functionality or operation of the system and requests for informational support assistance, including product information requests and configuration assistance. Severity 4 means information is required on Cisco product capabilities, installation, or configuration. There is little or no impact to customer’s business operation. Customer and Cisco both are willing to provide resources during standard business hours to provide information or assistance as requested.
Q.  What is the escalation process?
A.  If a customer does not feel that there is adequate forward progress or feels that the quality of Cisco service is not satisfactory, Cisco encourages the customer to escalate the problem ownership to the appropriate level of Cisco management by asking for the TAC duty manager.
Note: Severity 1 and 2 escalation times are measured in calendar hours, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Severity 3 and 4 escalation times correspond with standard business hours.
For more information, download the Severity and Escalation Guide.
Q.  What is the Cisco TAC Connect Bot?
A.  TAC Connect Bot is a personal assistant that provides Cisco customers and partners with a self-service experience for common case inquiries and basic transactions. It can connect you with case owners and duty managers. You can access the bot from Support Case Manager and https://tacconnect.cisco.com.
