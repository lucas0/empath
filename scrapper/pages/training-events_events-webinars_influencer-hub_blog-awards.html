FAQ
Which blogs are eligible?
Active, independent blogs (please do not submit vendor blogs).
If I write on a platform like Cisco Learning Network, LinkedIn, Medium, or Spiceworks, can I enter my blog?
Yes, as long as our judges can view it.
What do you mean by independent blogs?
We’re not in the business of judging other vendors’ or partners’ blogs. The content you write should reflect your own thoughts.
What subject matter is acceptable?
Are you writing about the trends shaping networks and how business is changing?  Do you noodle on the latest routers, switches, servers, or wireless access points?   Are you thinking about programmability, data centers, NOCs, or SOCs? Does collaboration bring you joy? You’re in the right place.
How are winners selected?
See terms and conditions.
I’m a Cisco employee.  Can I apply?
Cisco employees are not eligible to apply.  However, if you’re interested in participating as an internal judge, please contact us with subject line "IT Blog Awards Judge Application Request."
Have questions?
Email us and we’ll do our best to get you a good answer.
