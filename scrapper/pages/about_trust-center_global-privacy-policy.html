1. Purpose
Cisco is committed to protecting the privacy of Personal Data of its Workers, Customers, business partners, and other individuals. Cisco has, therefore, implemented a global privacy program to establish and maintain high standards for creating, collecting, using, disclosing, storing, securing, accessing, transferring, or otherwise processing Personal Data. This Global Privacy Policy is the foundation of that program and describes the approach taken by Cisco when processing Personal Data worldwide.
2. Scope
All Cisco employees, contractors, vendors, consultants, temporary agency workers, and other agents of any Cisco Group Company (“Cisco Workers”) must comply with this Policy, including all personnel affiliated with third parties who may have access to any Cisco network or resource, including cloud-based services, hosted inside or outside of Cisco.
This Global Privacy Policy applies globally to Personal Data that Cisco processes, whether by electronic or non-electronic means (i.e., in hard copy, paper, or analog form). This Policy applies to any Personal Data Processing that is done for or by Cisco.
With respect to People Data and Business Personal Data specifically, this Global Privacy Policy is supplemented by the Cisco Global People Data Protection Policy, European People Data Protection Policy, and the Cisco Business Personal Data Privacy Policy. These internal policy documents describe in more detail how this Global Privacy Policy applies to People Data and Business Personal Data, respectively, and provide guidance to Cisco Workers on the proper handling of Personal Data.
3. Policy Statements
3.1 Adequate Safeguards for Processing of Personal Data
In conjunction with the Global People Data Protection Policy, the European People Data Protection Policy, and the Business Personal Data Privacy Policy, this Global Privacy Policy is also intended to provide adequate safeguards for the processing of Personal Data entrusted to Cisco and transferred from countries requiring such protections. This is to help enable Cisco to transfer Personal Data wherever it is needed globally to support its internal business processes or promote services and product functionality and improvement. To do this, the Global People Data Protection Policy, European People Data Protection Policy, and the Business Personal Data Privacy Policy each describe certain additional obligations and legal rights in circumstances where European Data Protection Law, American, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and other countries or regions’ Personal Data Protection and Privacy Laws or requirements differ and are applicable.
3.2 Compliance with Applicable Law
Cisco shall comply with applicable Personal Data Protection and Privacy Laws and requirements worldwide.
Where applicable Personal Data Protection and Privacy Laws require a higher standard of protection for Personal Data than presented in this Global Privacy Policy, the requirements of applicable personal data protection law shall prevail. Where applicable Personal Data Protection and Privacy Laws establish a lower standard of protection for Personal Data than presented in this Global Privacy Policy, the requirements of this Global Privacy Policy shall prevail.
Where Cisco Workers have reason to believe that applicable law prevents Cisco from fulfilling its obligations under this Global Privacy Policy, they shall promptly inform the Privacy Center of Excellence and Cisco Legal via the Privacy Request Form. Where there is a conflict between applicable law and this Global Privacy Policy, the Chief Privacy Officer and Cisco Legal shall make a responsible decision regarding what action to take to resolve such a conflict and shall consult with the relevant regulatory authority in cases of doubt. This includes resolving conflicts that may arise in the course of business taking place in a third country which are likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the guarantees provided by this policy.
3.3 Privacy Principles
The following high-level principles establish Cisco practices for collecting, using, disclosing, storing, securing, accessing, transferring, or otherwise processing Personal Data.
Fairness
Cisco shall process Personal Data in a fair, lawful, legitimate, and transparent manner.
Purpose Limitation
Cisco shall only create or collect Personal Data for a specific, explicit, and legitimate purpose(s). Any subsequent processing shall be compatible with such purpose(s), unless Cisco has obtained the individual’s consent, or the processing is otherwise permitted by law.
Proportionality
Cisco shall only process Personal Data that is adequate, relevant, and not excessive for the purpose(s) for which it is processed.
Data Integrity
Cisco shall keep Personal Data accurate, complete, and up to date as is reasonably necessary for the purpose(s) for which it is processed.
Data Retention and Disposal
Cisco shall keep Personal Data in a form that is personally identifiable for no longer than necessary to accomplish the purpose(s), or other permitted purpose(s), for which the Personal Data was obtained. Thereafter, it shall either be destroyed, deleted, anonymized, or removed from our systems.
Data Security
Cisco shall implement appropriate and reasonable physical, technical, and organizational measures to safeguard Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, use, or access. Cisco shall instruct and contractually require third parties processing Personal Data on behalf of Cisco, if any, to: (a) process it only for purposes consistent with Cisco’s purpose(s) for processing; and (b) implement appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures to safeguard the Personal Data.
Individual Rights
Cisco shall process Personal Data in a manner that respects individuals’ rights under applicable Personal Data Protection and Privacy Laws.
Accountability
Cisco shall implement appropriate governance, policies, processes, controls, and other measures necessary to enable it to demonstrate that its processing of Personal Data is in accordance with this Global Privacy Policy and applicable Personal Data Protection and Privacy Laws.
Cisco as a Processor
In circumstances where Cisco processes Personal Data as a Processor on behalf of a Customer as an integral part of Cisco’s provision of its products and services to Customers under the terms of a contractual agreement, Cisco will comply with the Data Security and Accountability Principles set out above. Cisco will also provide reasonable cooperation and, to the extent reasonably possible, assistance to the relevant Customer to facilitate the Customer's compliance with the other Privacy Principles as well as privacy by design and privacy by default.

4.3 Compliance Measurement
Compliance with this Global Privacy Policy is verified by various means, including reports from available business tools, internal and external audits, self-assessment, and/or feedback to the policy owner(s). Cisco will monitor its compliance with this Policy on an ongoing basis. Cisco will periodically verify that this Global Privacy Policy continues to conform to the applicable Personal Data Protection and Privacy Laws and is being complied with. Cisco will make the final results of reports of its internal or external Audits to relevant regulatory authorities upon request and with appropriate confidentiality protections.
4.4 Compliance Exceptions
Any exception to this Global Privacy Policy requires the written approval of the Chief Privacy Officer and Cisco Legal.
Any records of exceptions should be archived according to the Cisco Records Management Process.
4.5 Noncompliance
Compliance with Cisco policies is required. Deviations or non-compliance with this Policy, including attempts to circumvent the stated policy/process by bypassing or knowingly manipulating the process, system, or data may result in disciplinary actions, including termination, civil action and lawsuits, and referral for criminal prosecution as allowed by local laws.
In some countries, violations of regulations designed to protect Personal Data may result in administrative sanctions, penalties, claims for compensation or injunctive relief, and/or other civil or criminal prosecution and remedies against Cisco and culpable persons in their individual capacity.
