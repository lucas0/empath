Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCvf34445 There were no defects filed with this field notice at the time of publication.
Problem Description
Some RFGW-1 units might fail to boot up after a software upgrade or other user actions where the board requires a power cycle operation.
Background
Cisco has been working with some customers on an issue related to memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010. These memory components are widely used across the industry and are included in a number of Cisco products.
Although the majority of Cisco products using these components are experiencing field failure rates below expected levels, some components may fail earlier than anticipated. A handful of our customers have recently experienced a higher number of failures, leading us to change our approach to managing this issue.
While other vendors have chosen to address this issue in different ways, Cisco believes its approach is the best course of action for its customers. Despite the cost, we are demonstrating that we always make customer satisfaction a top priority. Customers can learn more about this topic at Memory Component Issue web page.
PLEASE NOTE - The products listed in this Field Notice have lower than expected failure rates. This assessment is based on actual usage of affected memory components, observed field failure rates and product replacements since 2012.
A degraded component will not affect the ongoing operation of a device, but will be exposed by a subsequent power cycle event. This event will result in a hard failure of the device, which cannot be recovered by a reboot or additional power cycle. For these reasons, additional caution is recommended for operational activities requiring the simultaneous power cycling of multiple devices. This issue has been observed most commonly on devices that have been in service for 24 months or more.
Problem Symptom
If the suspected hardware (listed in the Products Affected section) has been in operation for approximately 24 months, the product hardware might fail to boot up due to memory failure during a power cycle event caused by one or more of these actions:
Upgrade the software
Reload the entire product
Reload after installation
Online Insertion Removal/Replacement (OIR)
Note: The issue does not affect the chassis while in operation. A chassis failure might occur after one of the previous actions is taken.
There has been only one observed symptom to date; failure to boot.
Workaround/Solution
Normal SmartNet and warranty entitlement rules remain in place and are applied by the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) if you experience a failure in one of the products listed in the Field Notice. If you need assistance in order to determine which hardware part(s) might need replacement or if the product is out of warranty or out of contract, Cisco encourages you to raise your concern directly with your Cisco account team.
Fix on Failure Replacement Guidelines: Request RMA product through normal service support channels.
PID Action
Replace the chassis with Product ID (PID) CHAS-RFGW-1=.
How To Identify Affected Products
Physically inspect the unit in order to locate the PIDs.
