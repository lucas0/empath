Description
Quick Connect Workflow for Onboarding Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1
This feature provides an alternative, guided method in Cisco vManage to onboard supported WAN edge devices into the Cisco SD-WAN overlay network. As part of the Quick Connect workflow, basic day-0 configuration profiles are created, which apply to all Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices, irrespective of the device model and device family. This workflow adds edge devices to the WAN transport and establishes data plane and control plane connections.
This feature is supported on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices only.

Information About Quick Connect
Access the Quick Connect Workflow
Prerequisites for Using the Quick Connect Workflow
The organization name should be configured.
Certificate authorization for the Cisco vBond Orchestrator and the Cisco vSmart Controller should be configured.
The controllers (Cisco vManage, Cisco vBond orchestrator, and Cisco vSmart controller) should be installed and configured.

Note
If you haven't configured these, the Quick Connect workflow directs you to the Administration > Settings window in Cisco vManage to complete the prerequisite configuration.
Restrictions for Quick Connect Workflow
The Quick Connect workflow is limited to configuring WAN settings (VPN 0). To be able to complete the SD-WAN overlay bring up process, you also need to configure service-side VPN templates.
For detailed information about configuring network interfaces, see Configure Network Interfaces.
The Quick Connect workflow is supported for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices only.
The Quick Connect workflow supports creating day-0 configurations for a maximum of 25 devices at a time. If you have more than 25 devices, run the workflow more than once, as applicable.
You can have only one in-progress workflow at any given point.

Overview of the Quick Connect Workflow
The Quick Connect workflow in Cisco vManage creates a basic day-0 configuration profile, which is applicable to all Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices, irrespective of the device family and model. This workflow establishes control plane and data plane access in your WAN.
The behavior of the Quick Connect workflow depends on how you upload devices to Cisco vManage. You can upload your devices in one of the following ways, either as part of the Quick Connect workflow or independently.
Using the auto sync option, where your Smart Account is synced with Cisco vManage. This option requires Cisco vManage to be able to connect with the Cisco Plug n Play (PnP) portal
Using the manual upload method, where you download the authorized serial number file of devices from the Cisco PnP portal and upload it to Cisco vManage
Upload devices Using Auto Sync
The auto sync method of uploading your devices to Cisco vManage can be used for both, deployments that include cloud controllers and deployments that include on-premises controllers, provided that Cisco vManage is able to connect with the Plug n Play (PnP) portal.
How the Auto Sync Option Works with Cisco PnP
After the Cisco team has configured and deployed the Cisco SD-WAN controllers, an email, which includes the Cisco vManage information associated with the order is sent. To add devices to the overlay network in such a case, follow these steps:
Log in to Cisco vManage using the default credentials (admin/admin).
To transfer device information from Cisco PnP portal to Cisco vManage, sync your Smart Account or Virtual account in Cisco vManage. You need Cisco credentials of the Virtual Account administrator role for this step. For more information about uploading the WAN Edge router serial numbers, see Upload WAN Edge Router Serial Numbers from Cisco Smart Account.

Note
Every time you add new devices to the PnP portal, you need to resync Cisco vManage with the Smart Account or the Virtual Account for the new devices to appear in Cisco vManage.
After the device information is transferred to Cisco vManage, you can configure Cisco SD-WAN overlay.

Note
For more information about the Cisco PnP portal and its role in onboarding devices for Cisco SD-WAN, see the following reference documentation:
Cisco Plug and Play Support Guide for Cisco SD-WAN Products
Plug n Play Onboarding Workflow
How the Auto Sync Option Works with ZTP
If your supported WAN edge devices are registered with Cisco Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP), the device onboarding is automated and concludes with the devices being authenticated by the Cisco vBond orchestrator.
With ZTP, after a device is unboxed, connect its WAN port to the network, ensuring that the IP settings from DHCP are configured. This includes configuring the IP address, mask, gateway, and DNS. The device then looks for the ZTP server, which is aware of the Cisco PnP portal inventory. The ZTP server then authenticates the device and redirects it to the Cisco vBond orchestrator for further authentication.

Note
For more information about configuring the vEdge routers to join the overlay network automatically, see Prepare Routers for ZTP.
How Devices Onboarded Using the Auto Sync Option Appear
If you upload devices to Cisco vManage using one of the auto sync options (through Cisco ZTP or Cisco PnP), at the end of the Quick Connect workflow, your devices appear in the Cisco vManage dashboard, accessible from Monitor > Overview.
Cisco vManage Release 20.6.x and earlier: If you upload devices to Cisco vManage using one of the auto sync options (through Cisco ZTP or Cisco PnP), at the end of the Quick Connect workflow, your devices appear in the Cisco vManage dashboard, accessible from Dashboard > Main Dashboard.
Upload devices manually
You can choose to upload your devices to Cisco vManage manually, if:
You don't want to use the auto sync option, which requires you to sync your Smart Account with Cisco vManage
Your Cisco vManage instance is unable to connect with the Cisco PnP portal
How Manual Upload of Devices Works
Follow this procedure to manually upload your devices to Cisco vManage.
Download the authorized serial number file or the provisioning file from the Cisco PnP portal. This file is available in the PnP portal under Controllers > Provisioning File
Transfer the device information to Cisco vManage by manually uploading the authorized serial number file to Cisco vManage. For more information about manually uploading the WAN Edge router serial numbers, see Upload WAN Edge Router Authorized Serial Number File.
Quick Connect Behavior with Manual Upload of Devices
If you upload your devices to Cisco vManage using the manual method, they do not appear in the Cisco vManage dashboard until you deploy them using the CLI bootsrap configuration that the Quick Connect workflow generates.
The bootstrap method helps you onboard a factory-shipped WAN Edge device with the configuration needed to securely deploy it to join the Cisco SD-WAN network.

Note
For the complete procedure to deploy Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices using the CLI bootstrap configuration, see On-Site Bootstrap Process for Cisco SD-WAN Devices.
Access the Quick Connect Workflow
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Workflows.
Start a new Quick Connect workflow: Under the Library area, choose Quick Connect.
OR
Resume an in-progress Quick Connect workflow: Under the In-progress area, click Quick Connect.

Note
If you upload devices to Cisco vManage the manual upload method, you need to complete the additional step of deploying them using the CLI bootstrap configuration that the Quick Connect workflow generates. For more information about generating a bootstrap configuration file that loads to a device, see On-Site Bootstrap Process for Cisco SD-WAN Devices.
