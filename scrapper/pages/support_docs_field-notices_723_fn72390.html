Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCwb41132 Codec Pro, improved internal heat control
Problem Description
Inadequate cooling can cause the power supply in the Codec Pro to overheat and fail, which results in unrecoverable failure of the device.
Background
A number of factors can cause the power supply to overheat, such as installation location, air temperature, and air flow rate.
Problem Symptom
The device might unexpectedly shut down and become unresponsive.
Workaround/Solution
If the device is operational, install software Version 10.11.5.2 or later, which increases the power supply fan speed in order to improve internal cooling. If the device has already failed, follow the normal Return Material Authorization (RMA) process as per your service agreement or warranty terms, as there is no workaround once the failure has occurred.
