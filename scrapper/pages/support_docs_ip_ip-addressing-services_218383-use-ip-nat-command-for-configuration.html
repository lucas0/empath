Introduction
This document describes a configuration that uses the ip nat outside source static command and the IP packets results from the NAT process.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of this topic:
NAT: Local and Global Definitions
Components Used
The information in this document is based on Cisco 2500 Series Routers on Cisco IOSÂ®Software Release 12.2(27) .
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Background Information
This document provides a sample configuration with the use of the  ip nat outside source static command and includes a brief description of what happens to the IP packet during the NAT process. Consider the network topology in this document as an example.

Network Diagram
When you issue a ping sourced from Router 2514W Loopback1 interface destined to Router 2501E Loopback0 interface, this is what happens:
On the outside interface (S1) of Router 2514X, the ping packet shows up with a Source Address (SA) of 172.16.89.32 and a Destination Address (DA) of 172.16.68.1.
NAT translates the SA to the Outside Local Address 172.16.68.5 (correspondent to the ip nat outside source static   command configured on Router 2514X).
Router 2514X then checks its routing table for a route to 172.16.68.1.
If the route does not exist, Router 2514X drops the packet. In this case, Router 2514X has a route to 172.16.68.1 through the static route to 172.31.1.0. It forwards the packet to the destination.
Router 2501E sees the packet on its incoming interface (E0) with an SA of 172.16.68.5, and a DA of 172.16.68.1.
It sends an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo reply to 172.16.68.5. If it does not have a route, it drops the packet.
However, in this case it has the (default) route.
Therefore, it sends a reply packet to Router 2514X, with an SA of 172.16.68.1, and a DA of 172.16.68.5.
Router 2514X sees the packet and checks for a route to the 172.16.68.5 address.
If it does not have one, it responds with an ICMP unreachable reply.
In this case, it has a route to 172.16.68.5 (due to the static route).
It therefore translates the packet back to the 172.16.89.32 address, and forwards it out its outside interface (S1).

Verify
Note: Only registered Cisco users can access internal tools and information.
Use the Cisco CLI Analyzer to view an analysis of the show command output. The Cisco CLI Analyzer  (OIT) supports several  show commands. 
Use the show ip nat translations command to check the translation entries, as this output shows:
2514X#show ip nat translations
Pro Inside global      Inside local       Outside local      Outside global
--- ---                ---                172.16.68.5        172.16.89.32
2514X#
Troubleshoot
This example uses NAT translation debugging and IP packet debugging to demonstrate the NAT process.
Note: Because the debug commands generate a significant amount of output, use them only when traffic on the IP network is low so that other activity on the system is not adversely affected.
Note: Refer to Important Information on Debug Commands before you use debug commands.
This output is the result when you use the debug ip packet and debug ip nat commands simultaneously on Router 2514X, while you ping from the Router 2514W loopback1 interface address (172.16.89.32) to the Router 2501 E loopback0 interface address (172.16.68.1).
This output shows the first packet that arrives on the outside interface of Router 2514X. The source address of 172.16.89.32 gets translated to 172.16.68.5. The ICMP packet is forwarded toward the destination out the Ethernet1 interface.

This output shows the return packet sourced from 172.16.68.1 with a destination address of 172.16.68.5, which gets translated to 172.16.89.32. The resultant ICMP packet gets forwarded out the Serial1 interface.

Summary
When the packet travels from outside to inside, translation occurs first, and then the routing table is checked for the destination. When the packet travels from inside to outside, the routing table is checked for the destination first, and then translation occurs. Refer to NAT Order of Operation for further information.
Take not of the part of the IP packet that gets translated when used with each of the previous commands. This table contains the guideline:
Command Action
ip nat outside source static
Translates the source of the IP packets that travel outside to inside.
Translates the destination of the IP packets that travel inside to outside.
ip nat inside source static
Translates the source of IP packets that travel inside to outside.
Translates the destination of the IP packets that travel outside to inside.
These guidelines indicate that there is more than one way to translate a packet. Based on your specific needs, you need to determine how to define the NAT interfaces (inside or outside) and what routes the routing table contains before or after translation. Keep in mind that the portion of the packet that is translated depends upon the direction the packet travels, and how you configure NAT.
