CSCvm62177 NCS1002:DC PSU- XR 6.3.2 doesn't recognise DC PSU module PID as valid PID - Failed provisionioning
Problem Description
The DC power supply, NCS1K-2KW-DC in the Network Convergence System 1002 (NCS 1002) chassis is not recognized and a critical alarm is observed when the software is upgraded from Cisco IOS® XR Software Release 6.3.1 to Cisco IOS XR Software Release 6.3.2 or 6.5.1.
In such SW configuration, when DC power supply is used, XR is limiting the provisioning and power to only two slices of the system.
Background
The issue is due to a power budget enabled with a wrong limitation. The operating power range for DC power supplies is miscategorized in the operating system and causes the unrecognized power supply error and alarm.
This issue is addressed by extending the supported power range for DC power supply units. See the Workaround/Solution section in order to resolve this issue.
Problem Symptom
A NCS 1002 chassis equipped with DC power supply modules (NCS1K-2KW-DC) that runs Cisco IOS XR Software Release 6.3.2 or 6.5.1 shows a critical alarm  (error message) as below:
"Unsupported Power module unit - NCS1K-2KW-AC2".
The show inventory and show diags commands on PM modules display the correct information as shown here:
