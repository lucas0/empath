Cisco Multigigabit Technology
Extend the life of your network investment
As wireless speeds increase, don't let your switches become a bottleneck. Prepare your access switches for Wi-Fi 6 and 802.11ac Wave 2 with Cisco Multigigabit Technology. It also supports Power over Ethernet (PoE and PoE+), and Cisco Universal Power over Ethernet (Cisco UPOE and UPOE+), so you don't need to install new electrical circuits to power your access points.

Features and benefits
Today's organizations depend on always-on connectivity, which is driving new wireless standards such as Wi-Fi 6E.
Support Wi-Fi 6/6E
Create better user experiences with Wi-Fi 6/6E and enjoy up to a fivefold jump in wireless speeds, up to 6.8 Gbps. Cisco Multigigabit Technology delivers speeds beyond 1 Gbps on existing cabling, surpassing previously achievable speeds.
Get NBASE-T technology
Use NBASE-T technology to support Wi-Fi 6 and 802.11ac Wave 2. By default, Category 5e cables inside buildings that connect switches to access points are limited to 1-Gigabit speeds. NBASE-T makes it possible to support up to 10 Gbps over those cables.
Power your solution
Cisco Multigigabit Technology supports PoE, PoE+, UPOE, and UPOE+, so you don't need to install new electrical circuits to power access points. You get 90 watts of UPOE+ to power downstream devices, including lighting, IP phones, shades, IPTVs, surveillance cameras, and virtual desktop clients.
