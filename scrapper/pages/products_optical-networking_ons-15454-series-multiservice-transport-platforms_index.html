Features and benefits
Get fourth-generation innovation
Cisco ROADM innovation continues into its fourth generation with the first Single Module ROADM. It combines multidegree wavelength switching functionality with optical amplification and spectrum analysis in a single slot line card.
Utilize new features
Along with advanced features, the 15454 provides wavelength switched optical network functionality. This embeds optical layer intelligence directly into network elements to support wavelength-on-demand services and dynamic restoration.
Gain flexible aggregation
Cisco optical transport aggregation solutions integrate packet, SONET, and OTN aggregation and switching into the DWDM transport platform. Customers will enjoy efficient wavelength fill and tight communication among network layers.
Streamline operations
Selected on a per card basis, a mix of Layer 1 services, time division multiplexing (TDM), and packet switching technologies can be deployed where needed. Meet customer and network requirements while simplifying operations. 
Scale to 100 Gb and beyond
Cisco leads the optical transport industry as it moves toward coherent technology for DWDM transport of 100 Gb services. Powered by nLight Silicon, Cisco coherent technology will scale to even greater densities and higher bit rates.
