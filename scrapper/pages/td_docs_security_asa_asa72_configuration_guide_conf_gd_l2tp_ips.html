Chapter: Configuring L2TP over IPSec
Chapter Contents

This chapter describes how to configure IPSec over L2TP on the security appliance, and includes the following topics:
•L2TP Overview
•Configuring L2TP over IPSec Connections
•Viewing L2TP over IPSec Connection Information
L2TP Overview
The primary benefit of configuring L2TP with IPSec in a remote access scenario is that remote users can access a VPN over a public IP network without a gateway or a dedicated line, enabling remote access from virtually anyplace with POTS. An additional benefit is that the only client requirement for VPN access is the use of Windows 2000 with Microsoft Dial-Up Networking (DUN). No additional client software, such as Cisco VPN client software, is required.
To configure L2TP over IPSec, first configure IPSec transport mode to enable IPSec with L2TP. Then configure L2TP with a virtual private dial-up network VPDN group.
The configuration of L2TP with IPSec supports certificates using the pre-shared keys or RSA signature methods, and the use of dynamic (as opposed to static) crypto maps. This summary of tasks assumes completion of IKE, as well as pre-shared keys or RSA signature configuration. See "Chapter 39, "Certificate Configuration,"" for the steps to configure pre-shared keys, RSA, and dynamic crypto maps.
Note L2TP with IPSec on the security appliance allows the LNS to interoperate with the Windows 2000 L2TP client. Interoperability with LACs from Cisco and other vendors is currently not supported. Only L2TP with IPSec is supported, native L2TP itself is not supported on security appliance.
The minimum IPSec security association lifetime supported by the Windows 2000 client is 300 seconds. If the lifetime on thesecurity appliance is set to less than 300 seconds, the Windows 2000 client ignores it and replaces it with a 300 second lifetime.
IPSec Transport and Tunnel Modes
By default, the security appliance uses IPSec tunnel mode—the entire original IP datagram is encrypted, and it becomes the payload in a new IP packet. This mode allows a network device, such as a router, to act as an IPSec proxy. That is, the router performs encryption on behalf of the hosts. The source router encrypts packets and forwards them along the IPSec tunnel. The destination router decrypts the original IP datagram and forwards it on to the destination system. The major advantage of tunnel mode is that the end systems do not need to be modified to receive the benefits of IPSec. Tunnel mode also protects against traffic analysis; with tunnel mode, an attacker can only determine the tunnel endpoints and not the true source and destination of the tunneled packets, even if they are the same as the tunnel endpoints.
However, the Windows 2000 L2TP/IPSec client uses IPSec transport mode—only the IP payload is encrypted, and the original IP headers are left intact. This mode has the advantages of adding only a few bytes to each packet and allowing devices on the public network to see the final source and destination of the packet. Figure 28-1 illustrates the differences between IPSec Tunnel and Transport modes.
Therefore, In order for Windows 2000 L2TP/IPSec clients to connect to the security appliance, you must configure IPSec transport mode for a transform set using the crypto ipsec transform-set trans_name mode transport command. This command is the configuration procedure that follows, "Configuring L2TP over IPSec Connections" section.
With this capability (transport), you can enable special processing (for example, QoS) on the intermediate network based on the information in the IP header. However, the Layer 4 header will be encrypted, limiting the examination of the packet. Unfortunately, transmitting the IP header in clear text, transport mode allows an attacker to perform some traffic analysis.

Configuring L2TP over IPSec Connections
To configure the security appliance to accept L2TP over IPSec connections, follow these steps:
Note The security appliance does not establish an L2TP/IPSec tunnel with Windows 2000 if either the Cisco VPN Client Version 3.x or the Cisco VPN 3000 Client Version 2.5 is installed. Disable the Cisco VPN Service for the Cisco VPN Client Version 3.x, or the ANetIKE Service for the Cisco VPN 3000 Client Version 2.5 from the Services panel in Windows 2000 (click Start>Programs>Administrative Tools>Services). Then restart the IPSec Policy Agent Service from the Services panel, and reboot the machine.
Step 1 Specify IPSec to use transport mode rather than tunnel mode with the mode keyword of the crypto ipsec transform-set command:
hostname(config)# crypto ipsec transform-set trans_name mode transport

Step 2 (Optional) Specify the local address pool used to allocate the IP address to the client using the address-pool command in tunnel-group general-attributes mode:
hostname(config)# tunnel-group name general-attributes
hostname(config-tunnel-general)# address-pool pool_name

Step 3 (Optional) Instruct the security appliance to send DNS server IP addresses to the client with the dns value command from group policy configuration mode:
hostname(config)# group-policy group_policy_name attributes
hostname(config-group-policy)# dns value [none | IP_primary [IP_secondary]]

Step 4 (Optional) Instruct the security appliance to send WINS server IP addresses to the client using the wins-server command from group policy configuration mode:
hostname(config-group-policy)# wins-server value [none | IP_primary [IP_secondary]]

Step 5 (Optional) Generate a AAA accounting start and stop record for an L2TP session using the accounting-server-group command from tunnel group general-attributes mode:
hostname(config)# tunnel-group name general-attributes
hostname(config-tunnel-general)# accounting-server-group aaa_server_group

Step 6 Configure L2TP over IPSec as a valid VPN tunneling protocol for a group or user with the vpn-tunnel-protocol l2tp-ipsec command:
For a group, enter group-policy attributes mode:
hostname(config)# group-policy group_policy_name attributes
hostname(config-group-policy)# vpn-tunnel-protocol l2tp-ipsec

For a user, enter username attributes mode:
hostname(config)# username user_name attributes
hostname(config-username)# vpn-tunnel-protocol l2tp-ipsec

Step 7 Create a tunnel group with the tunnel-group command, and link the name of the group policy to the tunnel group with the default-group-policy command from tunnel group general-attributes mode:
hostname(config)# tunnel-group name type ipsec-ra
hostname(config)# tunnel-group name general-attributes
hostname(config-tunnel-general)# group-policy group_policy_name

Step 8 Configure the PPP authentication protocol using the authentication type command from tunnel group ppp-attributes mode. Table 28-1 shows the types of PPP authentication, and their characteristics.
hostname(config)# tunnel-group name ppp-attributes
hostname(config-ppp)# authentication pap
Table 28-1 Authentication Type Characteristics
Keyword
Authentication Type
Characteristics
chap
CHAP
In response to the server challenge, the client returns the encrypted [challenge plus password] with a cleartext username. This protocol is more secure than the PAP, but it does not encrypt data.
eap-proxy
EAP
Enables EAP which permits the security appliance to proxy the PPP authentication process to an external RADIUS authentication server.
ms-chap-v1 
ms-chap-v2
Microsoft CHAP, Version 1
Microsoft CHAP, Version, 2
Similar to CHAP but more secure in that the server stores and compares only encrypted passwords rather than cleartext passwords as in CHAP. This protocol also generates a key for data encryption by MPPE.
pap
PAP
Passes cleartext username and password during authentication and is not secure.

Step 9 Specify a method to authenticate users attempting L2TP over IPSec connections. Use the authentication-server-group command from tunnel-group general-attributes mode to configure the security appliance to use an authentication server or its own local database.
Using an Authentication Server
To use an authentication server, use the authentication server group keyword:
hostname(config)# tunnel-group name general-attributes
hostname(config-tunnel-general)# authentication-server-group auth_server_group
Using the Local Database
To use the local database, enter the LOCAL keyword.
hostname(config)# tunnel-group name general-attributes
hostname(config-tunnel-general)# authentication-server-group LOCAL

Note The security appliance only supports the PPP authentications PAP and Microsoft CHAP, Versions 1 and 2, on the local database. EAP and CHAP are performed by proxy authentication servers. Therefore, if a remote user belongs to a tunnel group configured with the authentication eap-proxy or authentication chap commands, and the security appliance is configured to use the local database, that user will not be able to connect.
Step 10 Create a user in the local database with the username command from global configuration mode.
If the user is an L2TP client using Microsoft CHAP, Version 1 or Version 2, and the security appliance is configured to authenticate against the local database, you must include the mschap keyword. For Example:
hostname(config)# username t_wmith password eu5d93h mschap

Step 11 Configure the interval (in seconds) between hello messages using the l2tp tunnel hello command in global configuration mode:
hostname(config)# l2tp tunnel hello seconds

Step 12 (Optional) If you expect multiple L2TP clients behind a NAT device to attempt L2TP over IPSec connections to the security appliance, you must enable NAT traversal so that ESP packets can pass through one or more NAT devices.
To enable NAT traversal globally, check that ISAKMP is enabled (you can enable it with the crypto isakmp enable command) in global configuration mode and then use the crypto isakmp nat-traversal command. For example:
hostname(config)# crypto isakmp enable
hostname(config)# crypto isakmp nat-traversal 30
Tunnel Group Switching
Tunnel Group Switching enables the security appliance to associate different users that are establishing L2TP over IPSec connections with different tunnel groups. Since each tunnel group has its own AAA server group and IP address pools, users can be authenticated through methods specific to their tunnel group.
With this feature, instead of sending just a username, the user sends a username and a group name in the format username@group_name, where "@" represents a delimiter that you can configure, and the group name is the name of a tunnel group that has been configured on the security appliance.
To enable Tunnel Group Switching, you must enable Strip Group processing using the strip-group command from tunnel-group general-attributes mode. When enabled, the security appliance selects the tunnel group for user connections by obtaining the group name from the username presented by the VPN client. The security appliance then sends only the user part of the username for authorization and authentication. Otherwise (if disabled), the security appliance sends the entire username, including the realm. In the following example, Strip Group processing is enabled for the tunnel-group telecommuters:
asa1(config)# tunnel-group telecommuters general-attributes
asa1(config-tunnel-general)# strip-group
Viewing L2TP over IPSec Connection Information
The show vpn-sessiondb command includes protocol filters that you can use to view detailed information about L2TP over IPSec connections. The full command from global configuration mode is show vpn-sessoindb detailed remote filter protocol l2tpOverIpsec.
The following example shows the details of a single L2TP over IPSec connection:

===================
Using L2TP Debug Commands
You can display L2TP debug information using the debug l2tp command in privileged EXEC mode. To disable the display of debug information, use the no form of this command:
debug l2tp {data | error | event | packet} level
data displays data packet trace information.
error displays error events.
event displays L2TP connection events.
packet displays packet trace information.
level sets the debug message level to display, between 1 and 255. The default is 1. To display additional messages at higher levels, set the level to a higher number.
The following example enables L2TP debug messages for connection events. The show debug command reveals that L2TP debug messages are enabled.
hostname# debug l2tp event 1
hostname# show debug
debug l2tp event enabled at level 1
hostname#
Enabling IPSec Debug
IPSec debug information can be added to a Windows 2000 client by adding the following registry:
Step 1 Run the Windows 2000 registry editor: REGEDIT.
Step 2 Locate the following registry entry:
MyComputer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\CurrentControlSet\Services\PolicyAgent
Step 3 Create the key by entering oakley.
Step 4 Create the DWORD by entering EnableLogging.
Step 5 Set the "Enable Logging" value to "1".
Step 6 Stop and Start the IPSec Policy Agent (click Start>Programs>Administrative Tools>Services). The debug file will be found at "%windir%\debug\oakley.log".
