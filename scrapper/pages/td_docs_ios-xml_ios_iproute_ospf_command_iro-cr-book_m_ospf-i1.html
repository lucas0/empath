ip ospf fast-reroute per-prefix
To configure an interface as a protecting or a protected interface in a per-prefix loop-free alternative (LFA) repair path, use the ip ospf fast-reroute per-prefix command in interface configuration mode.
ip ospf fast-reroute per-prefix {candidate | protection} [disable]
Syntax Description
candidate
Specifies that the interface is protecting, that is, it can be used as the next hop in a repair path.
protection
Specifies that the interface is protected, that is, routes pointing to this interface can have a repair path.
disable
(Optional) Specifies that the interface is either protecting or protected.
Command Default
All interfaces are protected and protecting.

Cisco IOS XE Release 3.4S
This command was integrated into Cisco IOS XE Release 3.4S.
Usage Guidelines
If you know from the network topology that an interface cannot be used to reroute traffic (for example, if it goes to a customer site), you can use the ip ospf fast-reroute per-prefix command to disable it from being protecting interface.
Examples
The following example shows how to prohibit an interface from being a protecting interface:
Router(config)# interface Ethernet 0/0
  ip address 192.0.2.1 255.255.255.0
  ip ospf fast-reroute per-prefix candidate disable

This command was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 12.2(33)SRA.
Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2S
This command was modified. Support was added for this command in virtual network interface configuration mode.
Usage Guidelines
By default, each Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) interface inherits the LLS setting from the router level. The ip ospf lls interface-level command takes precedence over the capability lls router-level command. For example, if you have entered the no capability lls command to disable LLS at the router level, you can use the ip ospf lls command to selectively enable LLS for specific interfaces, in order to allow the router to enable OSPF nonstop forwarding (NSF) awareness only for these specified interfaces.
To unconfigure the interface LLS setting, enter either the default ip ospf lls command or the no ip ospf lls command to restore the default LLS setting for the interface that has been configured at the router level. For example, if the capability lls command is enabled (by default) at the router level, you can use either the default ip ospf lls command or the no ip ospf lls command to disable LLS on specific interfaces, for instance, to interoperate on network segments where there are routers that do not properly handle LLS.

Note
If the network is running OSPF with the LLS feature enabled by default, LLS is globally enabled for all interfaces. If a router in the network is connected to a non-Cisco device that is not in compliance with RFC 2328, there may be network difficulties involving the forming of OSPF neighbors. In this situation, we recommend that you use the ip ospf lls command with the disable keyword to disable LLS on the router that is connected to the non-Cisco device.
Examples
In following example, LLS is disabled on Ethernet interface 2/0:
Router(config)# interface Ethernet2/0
Router(config-if)# ip address 10.1.145.2 255.255.0.0
Router(config-if)# no ip directed-broadcast
Router(config-if)# ip ospf message-digest-key 1 md5 testing

ip ospf message-digest-key md5
To enable Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Message Digest 5 (MD5) authentication, use the ip ospf message-digest-key md5 command in interface configuration mode. To remove an old MD5 key, use the no form of this command.
ip ospf message-digest-keykey-idencryption-typemd5key
no ipospfmessage-digest-keykey-id
Syntax Description
key-id

Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2S
This command was modified. Support was added for this command in virtual network interface configuration mode.
Usage Guidelines
Usually, one key per interface is used to generate authentication information when sending packets and to authenticate incoming packets. The same key identifier on the neighbor router must have the same key value.
The process of changing keys is as follows. Suppose the current configuration is as follows:
interface ethernet 1
 ip ospf message-digest-key 100 md5 OLD
You change the configuration to the following:
interface ethernet 1
 ip ospf message-digest-key 101 md5 NEW
The system assumes its neighbors do not have the new key yet, so it begins a rollover process. It sends multiple copies of the same packet, each authenticated by different keys. In this example, the system sends out two copies of the same packet--the first one authenticated by key 100 and the second one authenticated by key 101.
Rollover allows neighboring routers to continue communication while the network administrator is updating them with the new key. Rollover stops once the local system finds that all its neighbors know the new key. The system detects that a neighbor has the new key when it receives packets from the neighbor authenticated by the new key.
After all neighbors have been updated with the new key, the old key should be removed. In this example, you would enter the following:
interface ethernet 1
 no ip ospf message-digest-key 100 
Then, only key 101 is used for authentication on Ethernet interface 1.
We recommend that you not keep more than one key per interface. Every time you add a new key, you should remove the old key to prevent the local system from continuing to communicate with a hostile system that knows the old key. Removing the old key also reduces overhead during rollover.

Note
If the service password-encryption command is not used when implementing OSPF MD5 authentication, the MD5 secret will be stored as plain text in NVRAM.
Examples
The following example sets a new key 19 with the password 8ry4222 :
interface ethernet 1
 ip ospf message-digest-key 10 md5 xvv560qle
 ip ospf message-digest-key 19 md5 8ry4222

Usage Guidelines
OSPF checks whether neighbors are using the same MTU on a common interface. This check is performed when neighbors exchange DBD packets. If the receiving MTU in the DBD packet is higher than the IP MTU configured on the incoming interface, OSPF adjacency will not be established.
If the ip ospf mtu-ignore command is enabled for a virtual network and you want to disable it, use the disable keyword in virtual network interface configuration mode.
Examples
The following example disables OSPF MTU mismatch detection on receiving DBD packets:
interface serial 0/0
 ip ospf mtu-ignore
ip ospf multi-area
To configure multiarea adjacency on a interface that is configured with Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), use the ip ospf multi-area command in interface configuration mode. To disable multiarea adjacency, use the no form of this command.

Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2S
This command was modified. Support was added for this command in virtual network interface configuration mode.
Usage Guidelines
Using this feature, you can configure broadcast networks as NBMA networks when, for example, routers in your network do not support multicast addressing. You can also configure nonbroadcast multiaccess networks (such as X.25, Frame Relay, and Switched Multimegabit Data Service (SMDS)) as broadcast networks. This feature saves you from needing to configure neighbors.
Configuring NBMA networks as either broadcast or nonbroadcast assumes that there are virtual circuits from every router to every router or fully meshed networks. However, there are other configurations where this assumption is not true. For example, a partially meshed network. In these cases, you can configure the OSPF network type as a point-to-multipoint network. Routing between two routers that are not directly connected will go through the router that has virtual circuits to both routers. You need not configure neighbors when using this feature.
If this command is issued on an interface that does not allow it, this command will be ignored.
OSPF has two features related to point-to-multipoint networks. One feature applies to broadcast networks; the other feature applies to nonbroadcast networks:
On point-to-multipoint, broadcast networks, you can use the neighbor command, and you must specify a cost to that neighbor.
On point-to-multipoint, nonbroadcast networks, you must use the neighbor command to identify neighbors. Assigning a cost to a neighbor is optional.
Examples
The following example sets your OSPF network as a broadcast network:
interface serial 0
 ip address 192.168.77.17 255.255.255.0
 ip ospf network broadcast
 encapsulation frame-relay
The following example illustrates a point-to-multipoint network with broadcast:

Cisco IOS XE Release 2.6
This command was integrated into Cisco IOS XE Release 2.6
Usage Guidelines
You can suppress IP prefixes on a per-interface basis for all interface types by entering the ip ospf prefix-suppression command in interface configuration mode.
When the ip ospf prefix-suppression command is configured, it takes precedence over the prefix-suppression router configuration command. If the prefix-suppression router configuration command has been entered, the interfaces for the specified OSPF process will inherit the prefix suppression setting from the router configuration command.
When you enter the ip ospf prefix-suppression command, prefix generation for any interface type, including loopbacks and passive interfaces, is suppressed. Only prefixes associated with secondary IP addressees remain unaffected.
Examples
The following example suppresses all IP prefixes, except for those associated with secondary IP addresses, for GigabitEthernet interface 1/1/1:
interface gigabitethernet 1/1/1

Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2S
This command was modified. Support was added for this command in virtual network interface configuration mode.
Usage Guidelines
When two routers attached to a network both attempt to become the designated router, the one with the higher router priority takes precedence. If there is a tie, the router with the higher router ID takes precedence. A router with a router priority set to zero is ineligible to become the designated router or backup designated router. Router priority is configured only for interfaces to multiaccess networks (in other words, not to point-to-point networks).
This priority value is used when you configure Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) for nonbroadcast networks using the neighbor router configuration command for OSPF.
Examples
The following example sets the router priority value to 4:
interface ethernet 0
 ip ospf priority 4

Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2S
This command was modified. Support was added for this command in virtual network interface configuration mode.
Usage Guidelines
When an OSPF nonstop forwarding (NSF) router performs a route processor (RP) switchover, it notifies its neighbors, via a special hello packet, of such action and requests that each neighbor help resynchronize the Link State Database.
When a neighbor (that is NSF-aware) receives the special hello packet from the NSF-capable router, it starts a resync timeout timer and waits to synchronize its database with the NSF-capable router. If the NSF-capable router does not initiate the database resynchronization process before the resync-timeout timer expires, the NSF-aware neighbor will take down the adjacency with the NSF-capable router.
By default, the resync-timeout timer is set to 40 seconds or the dead interval of the interface, whichever is greater. (By default, the dead interval is 4 times the hello interval; the hello interval defaults to 10 seconds for Ethernet or 30 seconds for nonbroadcast.) The ip ospf resync-timeout command allows the resync-timeout to be changed and independent of the dead interval or default value.
Examples

Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2S
This command was modified. Support was added for this command in virtual network interface configuration mode.
Usage Guidelines
When a router sends an LSA to its neighbor, it keeps the LSA until it receives back the acknowledgment message. If the router receives no acknowledgment, it will resend the LSA.
The setting of the seconds argument should be greater than the expected round-trip delay between any two routers on the attached network. The setting of this parameter should also be conservative, or needless LSA retransmissions may occur. The value should be larger for serial lines and virtual links.

Note
It is recommended to use the same value for the seconds argument on neighbor OSPF routers. Using inconsistent values on neighbor routers can cause needless LSA retransmissions.
Examples
The following example sets the retransmit interval value to 8 seconds:
interface ethernet 2
 ip ospf retransmit-interval 8
ip ospf shutdown
To initiate an graceful shutdown of Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol at the interface level, use the ip ospf shutdown command in interface configuration mode. To restart the OSPF protocol on an interface, use the no form of this command.

Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2S
This command was modified. Support was added for this command in virtual network interface configuration mode.
Usage Guidelines
Link-state advertisements (LSAs) in the update packet must have their ages incremented by the amount specified in the seconds argument before transmission. The value assigned should take into account the transmission and propagation delays for the interface.
If the delay is not added before transmission over a link, the time in which the LSA propagates over the link is not considered. This setting has more significance on very low-speed links.
Examples
The following example sets the retransmit delay value to 3 seconds:
interface ethernet 0
 ip ospf transmit-delay 3
ip ospf ttl-security
To configure the Time-to-Live (TTL) security check feature on a specific interface, use the ip ospf ttl-security command in interface configuration mode. To disable TTL security on an interface, use the no form of this command.

Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2S
This command was modified. Support was added for this command in virtual network interface configuration mode.
Usage Guidelines
Use the ip ospf ttl-security command to configure TTL security on a specific interface.
The disable keyword can be used to disable TTL security on a specific interface but is only useful if the ttl-security all-interfaces command was used in router mode to first configure TTL security on all OSPF interfaces. In this way, all OSPF interfaces can be configured with TTL security and then individual interfaces can be disabled. This can save time as opposed to configuring each interface one-by-one from the start.
Examples
The following example shows how to effectively use the disable keyword to disable TTL security on Ethernet interface 0/0 after the feature has first been configured on all OSPF interfaces:
Router# configure terminal
Router(config)# router ospf 1
Router(config-router)# ttl-security all-interfaces
Router(config-router)# exit
Router(config
)
# interface ethernet 0/0

This command was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 15.2(1)E.
Cisco IOS Release 15.2(1)SY
This command was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 15.2(1)SY.
Usage Guidelines
There is a limit to the number of retransmissions of database exchange and update packets for both demand and nondemand circuits. The retransmission of these packets stops once this retry limit is reached, thus preventing unnecessary use of the link in continual retransmission of the packets if, for some reason, a neighbor is not responding during adjacency forming. The limit for both demand circuit and nondemand circuit retransmissions is 24.
The limit-retransmissions command allows you to either remove (disable) the limit or change the maximum number of retransmissions to be a number from 1 to 255. The configuration of this command provides for backward compatibility for previous or other releases of Cisco IOS Software or other routers that do not have this feature.
The limit to the number of retransmissions does not apply for update packets on nonbroadcast multiaccess (NBMA) point-to-multipoint direct circuits. In this situation, the dead timer is used to end communication with nonresponding neighbors and thus stop the retransmissions.

Note
This command can be used in the router configuration mode and address-family mode. The command is also applicable for both OSPF and OSPFv3 protocols.
Examples
The following example shows how to set the maximum number of demand circuit retransmissions to 10 in the router configuration mode:
Device> enable
Device# configure terminal
Device(config)# router {ospf|ospfv3} 11
Device(config-router)# limit retransmissions dc 10
The following example shows how to set the maximum number of demand circuit retransmissions to 10 in the address-family configuration mode:
Device> enable
Device# configure terminal
Device(config)# router {ospf|ospfv3} 11
Device(config-router)# address-family ipv4 unicast
Device(config-router-af)# limit retransmissions dc 10
The following example shows how to remove the limit for the number of demand circuit retransmissions:
Device> enable
Device# configure terminal
Device(config)# router {ospf|ospfv3} 11
Device(config-router)# limit retransmissions dc disable
The following example shows how to set the maximum number of demand circuit retransmissions to 10 and to set the maximum number of nondemand circuit retransmissions to 20:
Device> enable
Device# configure terminal
Device(config)# router {ospf|ospfv3} 11
Device(config-router)# limit retransmissions dc 10 non-dc 20
The following example shows how to set the maximum number of demand circuit retransmissions to 10, and to remove the limit for the number of nondemand circuit retransmissions:
Device> enable
Device# configure terminal

15.2(3)E

Usage Guidelines
If the local-rib-criteria is command is entered without any optional keywords, the local RIB will be used as criteria for all of the options (forwarding address, inter-area summary, and NSSA translation).
You can enter the local-rib-criteria command with one or more of the optional keywords to configure the OSPF routing process to use the local RIB only for forwarding address, inter-area-summary, or NSSA translation route generation.
The local-rib-criteria command is enabled by default for OSPFv3.

Note
It is recommended to keep the default behavior (the global RIB is used for route validation). Although entering the local-rib-criteria command alone or with one or more of the optional keywords may result in slightly faster network convergence in some cases, you may potentially cause a problem such as a routing loop or null route.

Note
When the forwarding-address keyword is entered to specify that forwarding-address verification is modified to use the local RIB, packet forwarding will still be dependent on the global RIB. If the global RIB contains a more preferred or more specific route from a different protocol, this preferred route still will still be used for packet forwarding.
Examples
The following example specifies that the local RIB should be used as the criteria for NSSA translation:
router ospf 23
 local-rib-criteria nssa-translation
The following example enables all local RIB criteria options:
router ospf 1
 local-rib-criteria
The following example specifies that the local RIB will be used only for inter-area summary route generation:

Usage Guidelines
To prevent the OSPF process from endlessly changing from the normal state of operation to the ignore state as a result of the LSA count exceeding the maximum configured number immediately after it returns from the ignore state to the normal state of operation, the OSPF process keeps a counter on how many times the process went into the ignore state. This counter is called the ignore count. If the ignore count exceeds the maximum number of LSAs that is specified by the ignore-count keyword and counter-number argument, the OSPF process remains in the ignore state permanently. To return the OSPF process to the state of normal operation, enter the clear ip ospf command.
If the router is placed into a permanent ignore state, we recommend that you identify and correct the cause of the problem involving the router that is generating the LSAs, or, if possible, increase the limit that has been configured by the max-lsa command before you try to bring the router back into normal operation.
If the router that has generated large numbers of LSAs is not reachable, these LSAs cannot be removed from the OSPF area and domain. As a result, any other router leaving the ignore state and returning to normal operation may reach the ignore state again. We recommend that you take one of the following actions in order to bring the router back into the network:
Temporarily increase the LSA limit to account for the stale LSAs.
Wait until the stale LSAs are removed as a result of reaching their maximum age.
Make sure that the router that has generated the large number of LSAs is connected to the network and is no longer generating large numbers of LSAs.
When the warning-only keyword is used, the OSPF process never enters the ignore state. When the LSA count exceeds the maximum limit that is specified by the maximum-number argument, only an error message is logged and the OSPF process continues in its normal operation.
When the max-lsa command is entered for the first time or when any of the parameters of the command are changed, the OSPF process undergoes a soft-reset procedure.
Examples
The following example sets a limit of 12,000 LSAs that can be received before the OSPF process enters the ignore state:
Router(config)# router ospf 100
Router(config-router)# router-id 209.165.201.0
Router(config-router)# log-adjacency-changes
Router(config-router)# max-lsa 12000
Router(config-router)# network 209.165.201.1 255.255.255.255
In the following example, an OSPF process has remained in the ignore state permanently. When the clear ip ospf command is entered the OSPF process returns to the state of normal operation and clears redistribution based on the OSPF routing process ID.
Router(config-router)# clear ip ospf 100 process

15.2(1)E
This command was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 15.2(1)E.
Usage Guidelines
Enabling the max-metric router-lsa command will cause a router to originate LSAs with a maximum metric (LSInfinity: 0xFFFF) through all nonstub links, which allows BGP routing tables to converge without attracting transit traffic (if there are not alternate lower cost paths around the router). The router will advertise accurate (normal) metrics after the configured or default timers expire or after BGP sends a notification that routing tables have converged.

Note
Directly connected links in a stub network are not affected by the configuration of a maximum or infinite metric because the cost of a stub link is always set to the output interface cost.
The max-metric router-lsa command is useful in the following situations:
Reloading a router. After a router is reloaded, Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) converge very quickly, and other routers may try to forward traffic through the newly reloaded router. If the router is still building BGP routing tables, packets destined for other networks that the router has not learned through BGP may be dropped. In the case of an Internet backbone router, a large number of packets may be dropped.
Introducing a router into a network without routing traffic through it. You may want to connect a router to an OSPF network but not want real traffic flowing through the router if there are better alternate paths. If there are no alternate paths, this router would still accept transit traffic as before.
Gracefully removing a router from a network. This feature allows you to gracefully remove a router from the network by advertising a maximum metric through all links, which allows other routers to select alternate paths for transit traffic to follow before the router is shut down.

Note
You should not save the running configuration of a router when it is configured for a graceful shutdown because the router will continue to advertise a maximum metric after it is reloaded.

Note
In older OSPF implementations (RFC 1247 and earlier implementations), the router link costs in received LSAs with a metric of LSInfinity are not used during SPF calculations, which means that no transit traffic will be sent to the routers that originate these LSAs.
Release 12.2(33)SRB
If you plan to configure the Multi-Topology Routing (MTR) feature, you need to enter the max-metric router-lsa command in router address family topology configuration mode in order for this OSPF router configuration command to become topology-aware.
Examples
The following example configures a router that is running OSPF to advertise a maximum metric for 100 seconds:
Router(config)# router ospf 100
Router(config-router)# max-metric router-lsa on-startup 100
The following example configures a router to advertise a maximum metric until BGP routing tables converge or until the default timer expires (600 seconds):
Router(config)# router ospf 100
Router(config-router)# max-metric router-lsa on-startup wait-for-bgp
The following example configures a router that is running OSPF to advertise a maximum metric, which causes neighbor routers to select alternate paths for transit traffic before the router shuts down:
Router(config)# router ospf 100
Router(config-router)# max-metric router-lsa
Router(config-router)# end
The following example configures stub links to be advertised with the maximum-metric in routers LSAs.
Router(config)# router ospf 1
Router(config-router)# router-id 10.1.1.1
Router(config-router)# max-metric router-lsa include-stub
Router(config-router)# end
Entering the show ip ospf max-metric command with the include-stub keyword displays output that confirms that stub links are advertised with the maximum metric.
Router# show ip ospf max-metric

15.1(2)SNG
This command was implemented on the Cisco ASR 901 Series Aggregation Services Routers.
Usage Guidelines
X.25 and Frame Relay provide an optional broadcast capability that can be configured in the map to allow OSPF to run as a broadcast network. At the OSPF level you can configure the router as a broadcast network. Refer to the x25 map and frame-relay map commands in the “X.25 Commands” and “Frame Relay Commands” chapters, respectively, in the Cisco IOSWide-Area Networking Command Reference for more detail.
One neighbor entry must be included in the Cisco IOS software configuration for each known nonbroadcast network neighbor. The neighbor address must be on the primary address of the interface.
If a neighboring router has become inactive (hello packets have not been received for the Router Dead Interval period), it may still be necessary to send hello packets to the dead neighbor. These hello packets will be sent at a reduced rate called Poll Interval .
When the router first starts up, it sends only hello packets to those routers with nonzero priority, that is, routers that are eligible to become designated routers (DRs) and backup designated routers (BDRs). After the DR and BDR are selected, DR and BDR will then start sending hello packets to all neighbors in order to form adjacencies.

Note
You cannot use the neighbor (OSPF) command to specify an Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) neighbor on non-broadcast networks within an OSPF Virtual Private Network (VPN) routing instance.
Prior to Cisco IOS Release 12.0, the neighbor command applied to NBMA networks only. With Release 12.0, the neighbor command applies to NBMA networks and point-to-multipoint networks. On NBMA networks, the cost keyword is not accepted.
Release 12.2(33)SRB
If you plan to configure the Multi-Topology Routing (MTR) feature, you need to enter the neighbor command in router address family topology configuration mode in order for this OSPF router configuration command to become topology-aware.
Examples
The following example declares a router at address 192.168.3.4 on a nonbroadcast network, with a priority of 1 and a poll interval of 180 seconds:
router ospf
 neighbor 192.168.3.4 priority 1 poll-interval 180
The following example illustrates a point-to-multipoint network with nonbroadcast:

15.2(2)SNI
This command was implemented on the Cisco ASR 901 Series Aggregation Services Routers.
Usage Guidelines
The ip-address and wildcard-mask arguments together allow you to define one or multiple interfaces to be associated with a specific OSPF area using a single command. Using the wildcard-mask argument allows you to define one or multiple interfaces to be associated with a specific OSPF area using a single command. If you intend to associate areas with IP subnets, you can specify a subnet address as the value of the area-id argument.
For OSPF to operate on the interface, the primary address of the interface must be covered by the network area command. If the network area command covers only the secondary address, it will not enable OSPF over that interface.
The Cisco IOS software sequentially evaluates the ip-address wildcard-mask pair for each interface as follows:
The wildcard-mask argument is logically ORed with the interface IP address.
The wildcard-mask argument is logically ORed with the ip-address argument in the network command.
The software compares the two resulting values. If they match, OSPF is enabled on the associated interface and this interface is attached to the OSPF area specified.
There is no limit to the number of network area commands you can use on the router.

Note
Any individual interface can only be attached to a single area. If the address ranges specified for different areas overlap, the software will adopt the first area in the network command list and ignore the subsequent overlapping portions. In general, we recommend that you configure address ranges that do not overlap in order to avoid inadvertent conflicts.
When a more specific OSPF network range is removed, interfaces belonging to that network range will be retained and remain active if and only if a less specific network range exists.
For example, consider the following configuration:
router ospf 1
 network 192.168.129.16 0.0.0.3 area 20
 network 192.168.129.40 0.0.0.3 area 20
 network 192.168.129.44 0.0.0.3 area 20
 network 192.168.129.96 0.0.0.3 area 20
 network 192.168.128.0  0.0.127.255 area 20
!
Enter the following:
no network 192.168.129.40 0.0.0.3 area 20 
Interfaces falling into the network range 192.168.129.40/0.0.0.3 will still remain active because the superset, 192.168.128.0/0.0.127.255, exists for area 20. A more specific network statement will cause interfaces belonging to that range to be removed from a different area only if a less specific network statement (superset) exists.
Consider a configuration such as the following:
!
router ospf 1
 network 192.168.128.0 0.0.127.255 area 20
!
If the following network statement is entered:
network 192.168.129.96 0.0.0.3 area 40 
then interfaces belonging to range 192.168.129.96/0.0.0.3, if any, are removed from area 20 and moved to area 40. Network statements with identical ranges but with different area IDs are considered as area changes. For example, the following network statements will cause interfaces belonging to network range 192.168.129.40/0.0.0.3 to move from area 20 to area 40:
network 192.168.129.40 0.0.0.3 area 20
network 192.168.129.40 0.0.0.3 area 40
Examples
The following partial example initializes OSPF routing process 109, and defines four OSPF areas: 10.9.50.0, 2, 3, and 0. Areas 10.9.50.0, 2, and 3 mask specific address ranges, and area 0 enables OSPF for all other networks.

12.2(20)S
This command was implemented on the Cisco 7304 router.
12.0(32)S
This command was replaced by the nsf cisco command.
Usage Guidelines
The user must configure NSF operation for OSPF only if a router is expected to perform NSF during restart. For users to have full NSF benefits, all OSPF neighbors of the specified router must be NSF-aware.
If neighbors that are not NSF-aware are detected on a network interface, NSF restart is terminated on the interface; however, NSF restart will continue on other interfaces. This functionality applies to the default NSF mode of operation when NSF is configured.
If the user configures the optional enforce global keywords, NSF restart will be canceled for the entire process when neighbors that are not NSF-aware are detected on any network interface during restart. NSF restart will also be canceled for the entire process if a neighbor adjacency reset is detected on any interface or if an OSPF interface goes down. To revert to the default NSF mode, enter the no nsf enforce global command.
Examples
The following example enters router configuration mode and cancels the NSF restart for the entire OSPF process if neighbors that are not NSF-aware are detected on any network interface during restart:
Router(config)# router ospf 1

Usage Guidelines
For Cisco IOS Release 12.0(32)S and later releases, this command replaces the nsf (OSPF) command.
This command enables Cisco NSF on an OSPF router. When NSF is enabled on a router, the router is NSF-capable and will operate in restarting mode.
If a router is expected to cooperate with a neighbor that is doing an NSF graceful restart only, the neighbor router must be running a Cisco software release that supports NSF but NSF need not be configured on the router. When a router is running a Cisco software release that supports NSF, the router is NSF-aware.
By default, neighboring NSF-aware routers will operate in NSF helper mode during a graceful restart. To disable Cisco NSF helper mode on an NSF-aware router, use this command with the disable keyword. To reenable helper mode after explicitly disabling helper mode on an NSF-aware router, use the no nsf cisco helper disable command.
If neighbors that are not NSF-aware are detected on a network interface during an NSF graceful restart, restart is terminated on that interface only and graceful restart will continue on other interfaces. To cancel restart for the entire OSPF process when neighbors that are not NSF-aware are detected during restart, configure this command with the enforce global keywords.

Note
The NSF graceful restart will also be canceled for the entire process when a neighbor adjacency reset is detected on any interface or when an OSPF interface goes down.
Examples
The following example enables Cisco NSF restarting mode on a router and causes the NSF restart to be canceled for the entire OSPF process if neighbors that are not NSF-aware are detected on any network interface during the restart.

Usage Guidelines
When a router in an OSPF process has NSF enabled, the router is said to be NSF-capable and will operate in graceful restart mode--the OSPF router process performs nonstop forwarding recovery due to a Route Processor (RP) switchover. By default, the neighboring routers of the NSF-capable router will be NSF-aware and will operate in NSF helper mode. When the NSF-capable router is performing graceful restart, the helper routers assist in the nonstop forwarding recovery process. If you do not want the router to help the restarting neighbor with nonstop forwarding recovery, enter the nsf cisco helper disable command.

This command enables NSR on an OSPF router. With NSR enabled, a router with redundant Route Processors (RPs) is allowed to maintain its OSPF state and adjacencies across planned and RP switchovers. It does this by checkpointing state information from OSPF on the active RP to the standby RP. Later, following a switchover to the standby RP, OSPF can use this checkpointed information to continue operation without interruption.
This command is present only in images for platforms that have a hardware or software redundancy capability.

Cisco IOS XE Release 2.6
This command was integrated into Cisco IOS XE Release 2.6
Usage Guidelines
You can globally suppress all IP prefixes (except prefixes that are associated with loopbacks, secondary IP addresses, and passive interfaces) for an entire OSPF process by using the prefix-suppression command in router configuration mode. You can also suppress IP prefixes on a per-interface basis by using the ip ospf prefix-suppression command in interface configuration mode. When the ip ospf prefix-suppression command is configured, it takes precedence over the prefix-suppression router configuration command.
Examples
The following example globally suppresses all IP prefixes except prefixes that are associated with loopbacks, secondary IP addresses, and passive interfaces for OSPF process 4:
router ospf 4
 prefix-suppression

process-min-time percent

Note
Effective with Cisco IOS 15.1(1)T release, the process-min-time percent command is not available in Cisco IOS 15.1(1)T and later releases. Improvements in Cisco IOS scheduler have made this command unnecessary.
To specify the minimum percentage of CPU process time OSPF takes before the CPU should yield to a process with a higher priority, use the process-min-time percent command in router configuration mode. To disable this function, use the no form of this command.
process-min-time percent percentage
no process-min-time percent
Syntax Description
percentage
Percentage of CPU process time to be used before trying to release the CPU for other processes. The valid value range is from 1 to 100. The default is 25.
Command Default
The default is 25 percent.

Support for IPv6 was added.
12.2(33)SRA
This command was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 12.2(33)SRA.
15.1(1)T
This command was removed.
Usage Guidelines

Note
Use this command under the direction of Cisco TAC only.
This command is supported by OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.
Use the process-min-time percent command to configure the minimum percentage of the process maximum time. Lowering the minimum percentage of CPU usage that a process can utilize is useful in some circumstances to ensure equitable division of CPU resources among different tasks. Once the percentage has been exceeded, CPU control may be given to a higher priority process.
The process maximum time is set using the process-max-time command. Use the process-min-time percent command in conjunction with the process-max-time command.
Examples
The following example shows how to set the percentage of CPU process time to be used before releasing the CPU:
Router# configure terminal
Router(config)# router ospf
Router(config-router)# process-min-time percent 35
The following example shows how to return to the default setting in IPv4:
Router# configure terminal
Router(config)# router ospf
Router(config-router)# no process-min-time percent

redistribute maximum-prefix
To limit the number of prefixes redistributed into Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) or to generate a warning when the number of prefixes redistributed into OSPF reaches a maximum, use the redistribute maximum-prefix command in router configuration mode. To remove the values, use the no form of this command.
redistribute maximum-prefix maximum [percentage] [warning-only | withdraw]
no redistribute maximum-prefix
Syntax Description
maximum
Integer from 1 to 4294967295 that specifies the maximum number of IP prefixes that can be redistributed into OSPF.
When the warning-only keyword is configured, the maximum value specifies the number of prefixes that can be redistributed into OSPF before the system logs a warning message. Redistribution is not limited.
The maximum number of IP prefixes that are allowed to be redistributed into OSPF, or the number of prefixes allowed to be redistributed into OSPF before the system logs a warning message, depends on whether the warning-only keyword is present.
There is no default value for the maximum argument.
If the warning-only keyword is also configured, this value does not limit redistribution; it is simply the number of redistributed prefixes that, when reached, causes a warning message to be logged.
percentage
(Optional) Integer from 1 to 100 that specifies the threshold value, as a percentage, at which a warning message should be generated.
The percentage default is 75.
warning-only
(Optional) Causes a warning message to be logged when the number of prefixes defined by the maximum argument has been exceeded. Additional redistribution is not prevented.
withdraw
(Optional) Prevents additional redistribution when the number of prefixes defined by the maximum argument has been exceeded.
Also, IS-IS rebuilds link-state PDUs (LSPs) without the external (redistributed) IP prefixes.
Command Default
The percentage default is 75.

Cisco IOS XE Release 2.1
This command was introduced on Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers.
Usage Guidelines
If someone mistakenly injects a large number of IP prefixes into IS-IS, perhaps by redistributing Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) into IS-IS, the network can be severely flooded. Limiting the number of redistributed prefixes prevents this potential problem.
When the redistribute maximum-prefix command is configured and the number of redistributed prefixes reaches the maximum value configured, no more prefixes will be redistributed (unless the warning-only keyword was configured).
The redistribution limit applies only to external IP prefixes. Default prefixes and summarized prefixes are not limited.
The limit is tracked separately for each not-so-stubby-area (NSSA) because redistribution to NSSAs is done independently for each NSSA and independently of all other regular areas.
Select a maximum value based on your knowledge of how many prefixes are redistributed on the router to the OSPF process.
Examples
Examples
The following example shows how to set a maximum of 600 prefixes that can be redistributed into IS-IS. If the number of prefixes redistributed reaches 75 percent of 600 (450 prefixes), a warning message is logged.
router isis
 redistribute maximum-prefix 600
The following example shows how to set a maximum of 1200 prefixes that can be redistributed into IS-IS. If the number of prefixes redistributed reaches 80 percent of 1200 (960 prefixes), a warning message is logged.
router isis
 redistribute maximum-prefix 1200 80
The following example shows how to allow two warning messages to be logged. The first message is logged when the number of prefixes redistributed reaches 85 percent of 600 (510 prefixes), and the second message is logged when the number of redistributed prefixes reaches 600. However, the number of redistributed prefixes is not limited.
router isis 
 redistribute maximum-prefix 600 85 warning-only
Examples
The following example shows how to set a maximum of 2000 prefixes that can be redistributed into OSPF process when the number of prefixes redistributed reaches 75 percent of 2000 (1500 prefixes), a warning message is logged. Another warning is logged when the limit is reached, and no more prefixes are redistributed.

Examples
The following example configures an OSPF routing process and assign a process number of 109:
Router(config)# router ospf 109
This example shows a basic OSPF configuration using the router ospf command to configure OSPF VRF instance processes for the VRFs first, second, and third:
Router> enable
Router# configure terminal
Router(config)# router ospf 12 vrf first
Router(config)# router ospf 13 vrf second
Router(config)# router ospf 14 vrf third
Router(config)# exit 
The following example shows usage of the maximum-paths option:
Router> enable
Router# configure terminal
Router(config)# router ospf
 
Router(config-router)# maximum-paths?
Router(config-router)# 20
 
Router(config-router)# exit
