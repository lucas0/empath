appnav-controller
To configure IPv4 addresses for an AppNav Controller, use appnav-controller command in Service Insertion AppNav Controller-group configuration mode. To remove the AppNav controller, use the no form of this command.
appnav-controller ipv4address vrf vrf
no appnav-controller ipv4address vrf vrf
Syntax Description
ipv4address
Specifies the IPv4 address of the AppNav controller.
vrf
Specifies the service VRF.
Command Default
None
Command Modes
Service insertion AppNav controller-group configuration (config-service-insertion-acg).
Command History
Release Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
The AppNav-XE component is made up of a distribution unit called the AppNav controller and service nodes. The AppNav controller intercepts network traffic and based on an AppNav policy, distributes that traffic to one or more WAAS nodes for optimization. The device in this context is a Cisco WAN edge device running AppNav-XE.
The AppNav Controller group configures the AppNav Controller. To configure the AppNav Controller group, enter the IP addresses used by the AppNav Controllers.
Examples
The following example shows how to configure the IP address 192.3.3.1 as an AppNav controller for traffic interception on VRF 2.
Device(config)# service-insertion appnav-controller-group scg
Device(config-service-insertion-acg)# appnav-controller 192.3.3.1 vrf 2

Command
Description
service-insertion appnav-controller-group
Configures an AppNav Controller Group.
service-insertion
To configure an AppNav Controller group (ANCG), Service Node Group (SNG) and service context that is part of an AppNav Cluster, use the service-insertion command. To unconfigure settings, use the no form of this command.
service-insertion { appnav-controller-group ancgroupname | service-node-group sngroupname | service-context contextname { waas } | waas interface interface }
no service-insertion
Syntax Description
ancgroupname
Specifies the name of an ANCG to configure and enters AppNav Controller group configuration mode to configure ANCG settings. If the ANCG does not exist, this command creates it.
sngroupname
Specifies the name of a SNG to configure and enters service node group configuration mode to configure SNG settings. If the SNG does not exist, this command creates it.
contextname
Specifies the service context name to configure and enters service context group configuration mode to configure service context settings. If the service context does not exist, this command creates it.
Command Default
No default behavior or values.
Command Modes

service-insertion appnav-controller-group
To configure an AppNav controller group, use service-insertion appnav-controller-group command in global configuration mode. To remove the AppNav controller group, use the no form of this command.
service-insertion appnav-controller-group group-name
no service-insertion appnav-controller-group group-name
Syntax Description
group-name
Specifies the name of the AppNav controller group.

Release Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
The AppNav-XE component is made up of a distribution unit called the AppNav controller and service nodes. The AppNav Controller intercepts network traffic and based on an AppNav policy, distributes that traffic to one or more WAAS nodes for optimization. The device in this context is a Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN edge device running AppNav-XE.
Use the service-insertion appnav-controller-group command to configure an AppNav controller group. You can configure different AppNav controllers on the AppNav controller group.
Examples
The following example shows how to configure the IP address 192.3.3.1 as an AppNav controller for traffic interception on VRF 2 on the AppNav controller group scg.
Device# config-transaction
Device(config)# service-insertion appnav-controller-group scg
Device(config-service-insertion-acg)# appnav-controller 192.3.3.1 vrf 2

Usage Guidelines
The AppNav-XE component is made up of a distribution unit called the AppNav controller and service nodes. The AppNav controller intercepts network traffic and, based on an AppNav policy, distributes that traffic to one or more WAAS nodes for optimization. The device in this context is a Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN edge device running AppNav-XE.
Use service-insertion waas interface command to enable WAAS service AppNav interception for an WAN interface, and in the case of a Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Overlay, a tunnel interface on the transport side (VPN 0).
Examples
The following example shows how to WAAS service AppNav interception for interfaces tunnel 2 and tunnel 3, both transport interfaces for a WAN edge device.
Device(config)# service-insertion waas interface Tunnel2
Device(config)# service-insertion waas interface Tunnel3
service node
To configure the IP address to be added to the SNG, use the service-node service node group configuration command. To unconfigure the IP address, use the no form of this command.
service-node ip-address
no service-node ip-address
Syntax Description
ip-address
Specifies the IP address of a service node to be added to the SNG. The address must be the IP address of the interface on which the service node is to receive traffic.

Command History
Release
Modification
