Forward Error Correction
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Release 16.11.x
Feature introduced. FEC is a mechanism to recover lost packets on a link by sending extra “parity” packets for every group of 4 packets.
Forward Error Correction (FEC) is a mechanism to recover lost packets on a link by sending extra “parity” packets for every group of 4 packets. As long as the receiver receives a subset of packets in the group (at-least N-1) and the parity packet, up to a single lost packet in the group can be recovered. FEC is supported on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.

Note
We recommend Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.3 as the minimum release when using FEC.
