CSCwa33117 Can't create CA cert directory on Webex-share when upgrade the certificate
CSCwa24255 Update CA bundles Trusted Root Release
Problem Description
Cisco Webex Room Phone and Cisco Webex Share fail to register with Control Hub.
Background
Cisco moved to a new Certificate Authority (IdenTrust Commercial Root CA 1) on November 20, 2021, and the existing certificates issued by HydrantID ICA G2 were invalidated on the same day.
This change has impacted some Cisco Webex Room Phone and Cisco Webex Share devices in the field, which results in these devices not being able to further register.
Problem Symptom
Cisco Webex Room Phone and Cisco Webex Share cannot register to Webex after November 20, 2021.
Workaround/Solution
In order to resolve this issue, the devices need to be reset to factory defaults and then reactivated. The exact procedures depend on the device type and the version of firmware they run. Those procedures are outlined in this section.
