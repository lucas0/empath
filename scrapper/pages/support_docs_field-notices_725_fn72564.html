Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCwe43473 694972748 "Error: cannot manipulate the keyStore." on OCS
Problem Description
When you upgrade from a previous release between and including ADP_Rel_2022.04_1.340 to ADP_Rel_2023.01_1.292, while keeping the Open Client Server (OCS) application release to OCS_2022.03_1.220 or earlier, OCS will be unable to access the Keystore/Truststore with the legacy password.
Background
After an upgrade from a previous release between and including ADP_Rel_2022.04_1.340 to ADP_Rel_2023.01_1.292, while keeping the OCS application to release OCS_2022.03_1.220 or earlier, OCS will be unable to access the Keystore/Truststore. Without access to the certificates, OCS will no longer work properly.
Problem Symptom
This CLI error is displayed:
Error: cannot manipulate the keyStore
Workaround/Solution
Workaround
After an upgrade from a previous release between and including ADP_Rel_2022.04_1.340 to ADP_Rel_2023.01_1.292, upgrade the OCS application to between OCS_2022.04_1.340 and OCS_2023.01_1.290. Otherwise, an upgrade to the Application Delivery Platform (ADP) ADP_Rel_2022.03_1.220 or earlier to ADP_Rel_2023.02_1.251 will restore the password.
If the ADP was already upgraded from a previous release to between ADP_Rel_2022.04_1.340 and ADP_Rel_2023.01_1.292, upgrade to ADP_Rel_2023.02_1.251, which includes an executable script restoreKeystorePassword.pl to restore the password.
Solution
Releases between ADP_Rel_2022.04_1.340 and ADP_Rel_2023.01_1.292 have been recalled.
In order to resolve this issue, customers should download and install the updated version of the release:
ADP_Rel_2023.02_1.252
