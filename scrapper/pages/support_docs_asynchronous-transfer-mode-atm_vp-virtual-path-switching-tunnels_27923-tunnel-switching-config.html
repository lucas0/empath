Introduction
This document provides sample configurations for virtual path (VP) tunnels and VP switching.
With VP switching, the switching decision is solely based on the virtual path identifier (VPI) number. This is unlike VPI and virtual channel identifier (VCI) for virtual channel (VC) switching, which reduces administration as well as allows for faster switching of cells.
With VP tunnels, the VP interface is a multiplexing/demultiplexing point on an ATM switch at which VCs from various ATM interfaces are aggregated to a VP on an interface. VPs are ATM connections that are an aggregate of multiple VCs that all have the same VPI number. VPs are most often used across WANs.
ATM Connections
The two major types of ATM connections are VCs and VPs.
VCs are uniquely identified on the port of an ATM switch by the VPI and VCI numbers.
VPs are uniquely identified on the ATM port by the VPI number on the ATM port.
In the diagram above, ATM cells that arrive on the VC are switched based on both the VPI and VCI number in the cell header. On the other hand, ATM cells that arrive on the VP are switched based on the VPI number only. Configuration of the ATM switch determines if the switch is supposed to be a VC or VP switch for a specific VPI/VCI pair or VPI respectively.
In this diagram, a cell is switched at the VC or VP level. With VC switching, the switch receives a cell with a configured VPI and VCI. It then looks up its connection table to determine the outgoing port (or ports) with a new VPI/VCI value. VCI/VPI 100/2 and 110/2 are attached to port 1 and the VCI/VPI associated with port 2 is 110/5. Notice that the VCI has only local significance and does not need to be unique. For port 3, the VPI/VCI associated with it is 1/50. VPI/VCI 7/100 and 7/110 are associated to port 4.
You can switch traffic from an upcoming port on the switch to an outgoing port. For example, you can determine that all traffic coming on port 1 VPI/VCI 2/100 is switched to port 4 VPI/VCI 7/110. In the same manner, you can configure the ATM switch to transfer traffic from port 2 VPI/VCI 5/110 to port 4 VCI/VPI 7/100. This table shows how the packets can be switched from one VPI/VCI to another. This is VC switching since it uses the VPI and VCI information to switch the traffic.
Another way to switch ATM traffic is to use only the VPI information. In this table you can see that port 1 VPI 2 is switched to port 4 VPI 7 and port 2 VPI 5 is switched to port 3 VPI 1.
Both VP and VC switching can be seen in this diagram:
There are three different types of VP tunnels on Cisco Enterprise ATM Switches:
Regular or unshaped VP tunnels
Shaped VP tunnels
Hierarchical VP tunnels
Regular or unshaped VP tunnels are VP tunnels on which there is no traffic shaping for any ATM service category. VP tunnels can be of any service category but cannot be shaped. VCs in a tunnel have to be of the same service category as the VP tunnel.
Shaped VP tunnels are VP tunnels that are traffic shaped. They are defined only for the Constant Bit Rate (CBR) service category on Cisco Enterprise ATM switches. All VCs within a single VP tunnel must be the same service category. The overall output of this VP tunnel is rate-limited by hardware to the PCR of the tunnel.
Hierarchical VP tunnels are VP tunnels that are traffic shaped and support VCs of multiple service categories to co-exist in the tunnel at the same time. They are used, for example, if you have more than one service category but only one VP tunnel.

Requirements
There are no specific requirements for this document.
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions.
An unshaped VP tunnel of any service category is supported on LS1010 (with either feature card per-class queuing (FC-PCQ) and feature card per-flow queuing (FC-PFQ)), a Catalyst 8540-MSR, a Catalyst 8510-MSR, a Cisco 7500 series router with PA-A3, and a Cisco 7200 series router with PA-A2 or PA-A3, Cisco 7500 series router with PA-A6, and a Cisco 7200 series router with PA-A6. Cisco IOSÂ® Software Releases 11.2, 11.3 or 12.0 support this feature. VCs within an unshaped tunnel have to be of the same service category of an unshaped VP tunnel.
A shaped VP tunnel of a CBR service category is supported on LS1010 with FC-PFQ, Catalyst 8510-MSR, Catalyst 8540-MSR, Cisco 7500 series routers with PA-A3, and Cisco 7200 series routers with PA-A2 or PA-A3, Cisco 7500 series router with PA-A6, and a Cisco 7200 series router with PA-A6. All VCs within a CBR VP tunnel have to be of the same service category.
Shaped VP tunnels are first supported in Cisco IOS Software Release 11.2(8.0.1)FWA4. Cisco IOS Software Release 11.1 and WA3 release trains do not support shaped VP tunnels.
For software versions after Cisco IOS Software Release 11.3(0.8)TWA4, it is supported for a service category of VCs within a shaped VP tunnel to be on CBR.
Earlier software versions that support shaped VP tunnel VCs within a shaped CBR tunnel have to be of the CBR service category.
Hierarchical VP tunnels of the CBR service category are supported on LS1010 with FC-PFQ, Catalyst 8510-MSR, and Catalyst 8540-MSR. The minimum software requirement is the W5 train of Cisco IOS.

Configure Shaped VP Tunnels
In this section, you are presented with the information to configure the features described in this document.
Note: To find additional information on the commands used in this document, use the Command Lookup Tool (registered customers only) .
If the VP Service Provider polices, the connection most likely experiences cell drops in the Service Provider network. The best way to overcome this is to configure shaped VP tunnels.
Shaped VP tunnels are VP tunnels that are traffic shaped. They are defined only for the CBR service category on Cisco Enterprise ATM Switches. All VCs within a single VP tunnel must be the same service category. The overall output of this VP tunnel is rate-limited by hardware to the PCR of the tunnel.

Restrictions for Shaped VP Tunnels
This list describes restrictions related to shaped VP tunnels.
LS1010 with FC-PFQ and Catalyst 8510-MSR support a maximum of 2x64=128 shaped VP tunnels. 64 shaped VP tunnels are supported on x/0/y numbered ports and 64 on x/1/y numbered ports.
Catalyst 8540-MSR supports a maximum of 8x64=512 shaped VP tunnels. A maximum of 64 shaped VP tunnels can be defined on each of these interface groups:
(0/0/x, 1/0/x)
(0/1/x, 1/1/x)
(2/0/x, 3/0/x)
(2/1/x, 3/1/x)
(9/0/x, 10/0/x)
(9/1/x, 10/1/x)
(11/0/x, 12/0/x)
(11/1/x, 12/1/x)
The bandwidth of the shaped VP tunnel is shared by the active VCs inside the tunnel in strict round-robin (RR) fashion.
Shaped VP tunnels do not support merged VCs for tag switching.
Unspecified bit rate (UBR)+ and available bit rate (ABR) VCs with non-zero minimum cell rate (MCR) are not allowed on a shaped VP tunnel interface.
A maximum of 128 VCs can transit an s-shaped VP tunnel interface.
Configure Hierarchical VP Tunnels for Multiple Service Categories
In this section, you are presented with the information to configure the features described in this document.
Note: To find additional information on the commands used in this document, use the Command Lookup Tool (registered customers only) .
A hierarchical VP tunnel configuration is used if you have more than one service category and cannot buy more than one VP tunnel. A hierarchical VP tunnel is a VP tunnel that is traffic shaped and supports VCs of multiple service categories to co-exist in a tunnel at the same time.

Restriction for Hierarchical VP Tunnels
This list describes restrictions related to hierarchical VP tunnels.
LS1010 with FC-PFQ, Catalyst 5500 with ATM Switch Processor (ASP) and FC-PFQ, and Catalyst 8510-MSR support a maximum of 62 hierarchical VP tunnels.
Hierarchical VP tunnels can only be defined on ports in slots 0 and 3 on LS1010 and Catalyst 8510-MSR. Hierarchical VP tunnels can be defined in slots 9 and 11 on Catalyst 5500 with ASP and FC-PFQ.
LS1010 equipped with FC-PFQ and ASP-B supports a maximum of 30 hierarchical VP tunnels on ports 0/0/z and 3/0/z combined, and a maximum of 32 on ports 0/1/z and 3/1/z combined. Use the show hardware command to find out the type of ASP and feature card.
LS1010 equipped with FC-PFQ and ASP-C as well as Catalyst 8510-MSR support a maximum of 30 hierarchical VP tunnels on ports 0/y/z and a maximum of 32 on ports 3/y/z.
On a Catalyst 5500 with ASP and FC-PFQ with a maximum of 30, hierarchical VP tunnels can be defined on ports 9/0/z and 11/0/7 combined. A maximum of 32 hierarchical VP tunnels can be defined on ports 9/1/z and 11/1/z combined.
On a Catalyst 8540-MSR, hierarchical VP tunnels can be defined on slots 0,2,9, and 11.
The maximum number of hierarchical VP tunnels varies between 120 and 240 depending on the type of port adapter modules (PAMs) used. If all the ports are super PAMs (full with modules), the maximum number of VP tunnels supported is 240. If all the ports installed are super CAMs with LS1010, the PAM's maximum number of hierarchical VP tunnels is 120.
Hierarchical VP tunnels cannot co-exist with any other type of connection (VCs, VPs, Tag VCs, regular or shaped VP tunnels, and so forth) on the same physical interface. Therefore, the only type of connection that can co-exist with hierarchical VP tunnels on the same physical interface are additional hierarchical VP tunnels and well known VCs (signaling 0/5, PNNI, 0/18, ILMI 0/16, and so forth).
Hierarchical VP tunnels can only support either ATM Forum VCs or Tag VCs, but not both at the same time.
When you perform on line insertion and removal (OIR) of PAM that has hierarchical VP tunnels configured for its ports, configuration of the hierarchical tunnel is preserved. If the same PAM is inserted back in, the hierarchical VP tunnel is automatically active. However, if a different type of PAM is to be inserted, it is strongly recommended that any configured hierarchical VP tunnel (on the port about to be removed) be deleted prior to the physical removal of PAM.
