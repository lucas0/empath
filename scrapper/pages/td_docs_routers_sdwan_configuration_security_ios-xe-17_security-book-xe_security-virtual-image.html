Chapter Contents
Cisco SD-WAN Manager uses a Security Virtual Image to enable security features such as Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), Intrusion Detection System (IDS), URL Filtering (URL-F), and Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) on Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Devices. These features enable application hosting, real-time traffic analysis, and packet logging on IP networks. Once the image file is uploaded to the Cisco SD-WAN Manager Software Repository, you can create policy, profile, and device templates that will push the policies and updates to the correct devices automatically.
Before you use these features, you must first install and configure IPS/IDS, URL-F, or AMP security policies, and then upload the relevant Security Virtual Image to Cisco SD-WAN Manager. After upgrading the software on the device, you must also upgrade the Security Virtual Image.
This chapter describes how to perform these tasks.
Install and Configure IPS/IDS, URL-F, or AMP Security Policies
Identify the Recommended Security Virtual Image Version
Upload the Cisco Security Virtual Image to Cisco SD-WAN Manager
Upgrade a Security Virtual Image
Install and Configure IPS/IDS, URL-F, or AMP Security Policies
Installing and configuring IPS/IDS, URL-F, or AMP security policies require the following workflow:
Task 1: Create a Security Policy Template for IPS/IDS, URL-F, or AMP Filtering
Task 2: Create a Feature Template for Security App Hosting
Task 3: Create a Device Template
Task 4: Attach Devices to the Device Template
Create a Security Policy Template
From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Configuration > Security.
Click Add Security Policy.
In the Add Security Policy window, select your security scenario from the list of options.
Click Proceed.
Create a Feature Template for Security App Hosting
The feature profile template configures two functions:
NAT: Enables or disables Network Address Translation (NAT), which protects internal IP addresses when outside the firewall.
Resource Profile: Allocates default or high resources to different subnets or devices.

Note
A feature profile template, while not strictly required, is recommended.
To create a feature profile template, follow these steps:
From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Configuration > Templates.
Click Feature Templates and then click Add Template.

Note
In Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1 and earlier releases, Feature Templates is called Feature.
From the Select Devices list, choose the devices that you want to associate with the template.
Under Basic Information, click Security App Hosting.
Enter Template Name and Description.
Under Security Policy Parameters, customize the security policy parameters if required.
Enable or disable the Network Address Translation (NAT) feature, based on your use case. By default, NAT is on.
Click the drop-down arrow to set boundaries for the policy. The default is Default.
Global: Enables NAT for all devices attached to the template.
Device Specific: Enables NAT only for specified devices. If you select Device Specific, enter the name of a device key.
Default: Enables the default NAT policy for devices attached to the template.
Set Resource Profile. This option sets the number of snort instances to be used on a router. The default is Low that indicates one snort instance. Medium indicates two instances and High indicates three instances.
Click the drop-down arrow to set boundaries for the resource profile. The default is Global.
Global: Enables the selected resource profile for all devices attached to the template.
Device Specific: Enables the profile only for specified devices. If you select Device Specific, enter the name of a device key.
Default: Enables the default resource profile for devices attached to the template.
Set Download URL Database on Device to Yes if you want to download the URL-F database on the device. In this case, the device looks up in the local database before trying the cloud lookup.
Click Save.
Create a Device Template
To activate the policies you want to apply, you can create a device template that will push the policies to the devices that need them. The available options vary with the device type. For example, Cisco SD-WAN Manager devices require a more limited subset of the larger device template. You will see only valid options for that device model.
To create a security device template, follow this example for vEdge 2000 model routers:
From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Configuration > Templates.
Click Device Templates, and then choose Create Template > From Feature Template.

Note
In Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1 and earlier releases, Device Templates is called Device.
From the Device Model drop-down list, choose the device model.
From the Device Role drop-down list, choose the device role.
Enter Template Name and Description.
Scroll down the page to the configuration submenus that let you select an existing template, create a new template, or view the existing template. For example, to create a new System template, click Create Template.
Attach Devices to the Device Template
From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Configuration > Templates.
Click Device Templates, and then choose Create Template > From Feature Template.

Note
In Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1 and earlier releases, Device Templates is called Device.
In the row of the desired device template, click ... and choose Attach Devices.
In the Attach Devices window, select the desired devices from the Available Devices list, and click the right-pointing arrow to move them to the Selected Devices list.
Click Attach.
Identify the Recommended Security Virtual Image Version
At times, you may want to check the recommended Security Virtual Image (SVI) release number for a given device. To check this using Cisco SD-WAN Manager:
Procedure
Step 1
From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Monitor > Devices.
Cisco vManage Release 20.6.x and earlier: From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Monitor > Network.
Step 2
Choose WAN – Edge.

Step 4
Scroll to the end of the device menu, and click Real Time.
The System Information page displays.
Step 5
Click the Device Options field, and choose Security App Version Status from the menu.
Step 6
The image name is displayed in the Recommended Version column. It should match the available SVI for your router from the Cisco downloads website.
Upload the Cisco Security Virtual Image to Cisco SD-WAN Manager
Each router image supports a specific range of versions for a hosted application. For IPS/IDS and URL-Filtering, you can find the range of supported versions (and the recommended version) for a device on its Device Options page.
When a security policy is removed from Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices, the Virtual Image or Snort engine is also removed from the devices.
Procedure
Step 1
From the Software Download page for your router, locate the image UTD Engine for IOS XE SD-WAN.

Drag and drop, or browse to the image file.
Step 7
Click Upload. When the upload completes, a confirmation message displays. The new virtual image displays in the Virtual Images Software Repository.
Upgrade a Security Virtual Image
When a Cisco IOS-XE SD-WAN router is upgraded to a new software image, the security virtual image must also be upgraded to match.

Note
If the IPS Signature Update option is enabled, the matching IPS signature package is automatically updated as a part of the upgrade. You can enable the setting from Administration > Settings > IPS Signature Update.
To upgrade the application hosting virtual image for a device, follow these steps:
Procedure
Step 1
Follow the steps in Upload the Correct Cisco Security Virtual Image to vManage to download the recommended version of the SVI for your router. Note the version name.
Step 2
