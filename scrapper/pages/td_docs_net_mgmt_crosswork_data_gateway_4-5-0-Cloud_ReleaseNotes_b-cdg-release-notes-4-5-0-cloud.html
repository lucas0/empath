This document provides information about Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway 4.5 for Cloud applications, including features, compatibility information, known issues, and limitations.
Product Overview
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway is a model-driven scalable data collection platform that enables real-time data collection from multi-protocol capable devices, thereby reducing the need for multiple collection points for multiple applications requiring data from the network.
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway offers central visibility into services collecting data and the type of data being collected.
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway is not a standalone product and is expected to be used with Crosswork Cloud applications. There is no separate software license needed for Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway.
Release Details
Cisco releases updated builds of Crosswork Data Gateway on the Cisco Support & Software Download site.
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway can be installed into a data center using any of the platforms listed in the following table. The file used for deployment is unique to each of these environments.
Table 1. Crosswork Data Gateway 4.5 Release Details
Platform
Use
VMware
*.ova file.
Note 
When using the latest Mozilla Firefox version to download the .ova image, if the downloaded file has the extension as .dms, change the extension back to .ova before installation.
OpenStack Platform
*.qcow2 BIOS file.
Amazon EC2
.ami file.

Note
Direct upgrade from a previous Crosswork Data Gateway version is not supported. You must create a new VM with the same parameters that replaces the existing Crosswork Data Gateway.
What's New
This section lists the features and enhancements delivered in Crosswork Data Gateway 4.5 for Cloud Applications.
Table 2. New Features in Crosswork Data Gateway 4.5 for Cloud Applications
Feature
Description
Introduced data collection from an Amazon datacenter
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway enables the periodic data collection from the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud web service and forwards the data to the Cisco Crosswork Cloud applications. These applications use the data for analysis and if required, alert an administrator for further action.
Additional vNIC to channel custom traffic
Provision to configure a dedicated vNIC (vNIC03) to route custom traffic such as SSH.
Enhancement to the Crosswork Data Gateway Interactive Console
The Interactive Console is improved with the following changes:
You can create an enrollment package file on your local machine by copying and pasting the package contents from the interactive console.
Using the controller session test option utility is available to test if an installed Crosswork Data Gateway is able to establish a connection with Crosswork Cloud. The utility also validates and analyzes the discrepancies between the resources (CPU and memory) assigned to the VM and the resources prescribed by the deployment profile.
Improvements to the Crosswork Data Gateway image
The AMI image format is enhanced to include DHCP support. After the image is booted, it enables registration with Crosswork Cloud.
Enhancements to the internal REST API
The remote debugging capabilities are improved using the internal REST API responsible for packet capture and tcpdump.
The following bug is resolved in this release:
Compatibility Information
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway 4.5 for Cloud applications has been validated for use with the following Crosswork Cloud applications:
Cisco Crosswork Trust Insights is a cloud-based SaaS solution that reports on the integrity of devices and provides forensics for assured inventory.
Cisco Crosswork Cloud Traffic Analysis service is a hosted application that provides rich analysis, visualization, and optimization recommendations for network traffic flows.
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway must be deployed using the Crosswork Cloud profile for use with Crosswork Cloud applications. For information on deployment, see Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway 4.5 Installation and Configuration Guide for Cloud Applications.
Table 1 shows software requirements for the supported virtualization platforms along with the physical and network resource requirements needed to support the Crosswork Data Gateway.
The resource requirements to install Crosswork Data Gateway are the same for all the data centers.

Requirement
Description
Data Center
VMware
VMware vCenter server 6.7, ESXi 6.5
VMware vCenter Server 7.0, ESXi 6.5 and 6.7.
Attention 
In VMware vCenter 6.5 (Flash and HTML5 interfaces) and 6.7 releases (6.7U1), the GUI installer does not process the OVF parameter list correctly. To prevent this issue, ensure that the following parameters in the vCenter vSphere Client > Deploy OVF Template > Customize template > 03. vNIC Role Assignment are specified as:
The interface for 03. vNIC Role Assignment > e. Control must be eth0
The interface for 03. vNIC Role Assignment > g. Northbound External Data must be eth0
The interface for 03. vNIC Role Assignment h. Southbound Data must be eth0
The 16. Controller Setting > a. Crosswork Controller IP should be crosswork.cisco.com
The 16 Controller Setting > b. Crosswork Controller Port should be 443

Custom traffic
Management traffic: for accessing the Interactive Console and troubleshooting the Crosswork Data Gateway VM.
Control/Data traffic: to receive configuration of collection jobs from the Crosswork Cloud and to forward collected data to the Crosswork Cloud.
Important 
Crosswork Data Gateway can connect to the Cloud only when the Control/Data interface has access to the Internet.
Device access traffic: for device management and telemetry data.
Custom traffic: for routing the custom traffic such as SSH traffic.
IP Addresses
One, two, or three IPv4 or IPv6 addresses based on the number of interfaces you choose to use.
Note 
Crosswork does not support dual stack configurations. Therefore, ALL addresses for the environment must be either IPv4 or IPv6.
NTP Servers
The IPv4 or IPv6 addresses or host names of the NTP servers you plan to use. If you want to enter multiple NTP servers, separate them with spaces. These should be the same NTP servers you use to synchronize devices, clients, and servers across your network.
Note 
Confirm that the NTP IP address or host name is reachable on the network or installation fails.
The Crosswork Data Gateway host and virtual machine must be synchronized to an NTP server or the enrollment with Crosswork Cloud may not go through.
DNS Servers
The IPv4 or IPv6 addresses of the DNS servers you plan to use. If you want to enter multiple DNS servers, separate them with spaces. These should be the same DNS servers you use to resolve host names across your network.
DNS Search Domain
The search domain you want to use with the DNS servers (for example, cisco.com). You can only have one search domain.
(optional) Proxy Server
URL of an optional management network proxy server.
If your environment requires an HTTP or HTTPS proxy in order to access URLs on the public Internet, you must configure a proxy server for the Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway to successfully connect to the Crosswork Cloud service.
(optional) Syslog Server
Hostname, IPv4, or IPv6 address of an optional syslog server.
(optional) Auditd Server
Hostname, IPv4, or IPv6 address of an optional Auditd server.

Important
With these requirements, additional settings that must be configured to install Crosswork Data Gateway on Amazon EC2. For information on the EC2 requirements, see the Section: Amazon EC2 Settings in Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway 4.5 Installation and Configuration Guide for Cloud Applications.
