Information about Packet Duplication
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices use packet duplication to overcome packet loss.
Packet duplication sends copies of packets on alternate available paths to reach Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. If one of the packets is lost, a copy of the packet is forwarded to the server. Receiving Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices discard copies of the packet and forward one packet to the server.
Packet duplication is suitable for edges with multiple access links. Once packet duplication is configured and pushed to your device, you can see the tunnel packet duplication statistics.

Note
Packet duplication interop, forward error correction (FEC) and TCP optimization on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices is not supported between Cisco IOS XE Release 16.x and Cisco IOS XE Release 17.x versions.

In the left pane, click Applications.
On the Application usage, select the application family of interest, and click on the Application family listed.
If packet duplication is enabled for any application, vManage displays Packet Delivery Performance as GOOD, MODERATE, or POOR or the field displays as N/A.
GOOD and MODERATE performance is a clickable link. When clicking on the link, the status pops up a window.
On the pop-up window, you see Application, Packet Delivery Performance, Overall for the Application, Average Drop Rate, and Overall for the Application information. The time slot graph represents the packets transmitted with different available link colors and the overall performance calculated when packet duplication is enabled.
If you hover over the time slot, you can see the performance status and the average drop rate for each link.
