Introduction
This document describes how to configure Client Certificate-based authentication for Identity Services Engine (ISE) management access. In this example, the ISE administrator authenticates against the User certificate to gain Admin access to the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) management GUI.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends to have knowledge of these topics:
ISE configuration for password and certificate authentication.
Microsoft Active Directory (AD)
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) Version 2.6
Windows Active Directory (AD) Server 2008 Release 2
Certificate
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If the network is live, make sure to understand the potential impact of any configuration.

Configure
Use this section to configure the Client certificate or Smart Card as an external identity for administrative access to the Cisco ISE management GUI.
Network Diagram
Join ISE to Active Directory
Choose Administration > Identity Management > External Identity Sources > Active Directory.

Create an Active Directory instance with Join Point name and AD domain in Cisco ISE.

Click Submit.



Join all the nodes with the appropriate Username and Password in the prompt.



Click Save.
Select Directory Groups
Create an external Administrator group and map it to the active directory group.

Choose Administration >Identity Management > External Identity Sources > Active Directory > Groups > Select Groups from Directory.

Retrieve at least one AD Group to which the administrator belongs.



Click Save.
Enable Active Directory Password-Based Authentication for Administrative Access
Enable active directory instance as Password-based authentication method which has joined ISE earlier.

Choose Administration > System > Admin access > Authentication, as shown in the image.



Click Save.
Note: Password-Based authentication configuration is required to enable Certificate-Based authentication. This configuration should be reverted after a successful configuration of Certificate-Based authentication.
Map External Identity Groups to Admin Groups
In this example, the external AD group is mapped to the default Admin group.
Choose Administration >System >Admin Access >Administrators >Admin Groups > Super admin.

Check the Type as External and select the AD group under External groups.



Click Save.

Choose Administration > System > Admin Access > Administrators > Admin Groups > Read Only Admin.

Check the Type as External and select the AD group under External groups, as shown in the image.



Click Save.
Import Trusted Certificate
Import the Certificate authority(CA) certificate that signs the client certificate.

Choose Administrator > System > Certificates > Trusted Certificate > Import.

Click browse and choose the CA certificate.

Check the Trust for client authentication and Syslog checkbox, as shown in the image.



Click Submit.
Configure Certificate Authentication Profile
In order to create Certificate Authentication Profile for Client certificate-based authentication, Choose Administration >Identity Management > External Identity Sources > Certificate Authentication Profile > Add.

Add profile name.

Select the appropriate attribute that contains the administrator username in the certificate attribute.

If the AD record for the user contains the user's certificate, and want to compare the certificate that is received from the browser against the certificate in AD, check Always perform binary comparison checkbox, and select the Active Directory instance name that was specified earlier.



Click Submit.
Note: The same Certificate authentication profile can be consumed for endpoint Identity-based authentication also. 
Enable Client Certificate-based Authentication
Choose Administration > System > Admin Access > Authentication > Authentication Method Client Certificate Based.



Click OK.

Choose the Certificate Authentication Profile that is configured earlier.

Select the Active Directory instance name.



Click Save.

ISE services on all the nodes in the deployment restarts.

Verify
Verify access to the ISE GUI after the Application Server service status changes to running.
Super Admin User: Verify that the user is prompted to choose a certificate to login to the ISE GUI and is given Super Admin privileges if the certificate is of a user part of the Super Admin External Identity group.
Read-only Admin User: Verify that the user is prompted to choose a certificate to login to the ISE GUI and is given Read-only Admin privileges if the certificate is of a user part of Read-only Admin External Identity group.
Note: If Common Access Card (CAC) is in use, Smartcard presents the user certificate to ISE after the user enters their valid super pin.
Troubleshoot
Use the application start ise safe command to start Cisco ISE in a safe mode that allows to disable access control temporarily to the Admin portal and Correct the configuration and restart the services of ISE with the command application stop ise followed by application start ise.
The safe option provides a means of recovery if an administrator inadvertently locks out access to the Cisco ISE Admin portal for all users. This event can happen if the administrator configured an incorrect IP Access list in the Administration > Admin Access > Settings > Access page. The safe option also bypasses certificate-based authentication and reverts to the default username and password authentication for logging into the Cisco ISE Admin portal.
