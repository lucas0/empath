Introduction
This document describes how to configure Device Sensor, so that it can be used for profiling purposes on ISE. Device sensor is a feature of access devices. It allows to collect information about connected endpoints. Mostly, information collected by Device Sensor can come from the following protocols:
Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP)
Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP)
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
On some platforms it is possible to use also H323, SIP (Session Initiation Protocol), MDNS (Multicast Domain Resolution) or HTTP protocols. Configuration possibilities for device sensor capabilities can vary from protocol to protocol. As an example above is available on Cisco Catalyst 3850 with software 03.07.02.E.
Once the information is collected, it can be encapsulated in radius accounting and send to a profiling server. In this article Identity Service Engine (ISE) is used as a profiling server.
Prerequisites
Requirements
 Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:
Radius protocol
CDP, LLDP and DHCP protocols
Cisco Identity Service Engine
Cisco Catalyst Switch 2960
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
Cisco Identity Service Engine version 1.3 patch 3
Cisco Catalyst Switch 2960s version 15.2(2a)E1
Cisco IP Phone 8941 version SCCP 9-3-4-17
Configure
Step 1. Standard AAA configuration
In order to configure Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA), follow the steps below:
1. Enable AAA using aaa new-model command and enable 802.1X globally on the switch
2. Configure Radius server and enable dynamic authorization (Change of Authorization - CoA)
3. Enable CDP and LLDP protocols
4. Add switchport authentication configuration

In newer software version command radius-server vsa send accounting is enabled by default. If you cannot see attributes send in accounting, verify if the command in enabled.
Step 2. Configure Device Sensor
1. Determine which attributes from CDP/LLDP are needed to profile the device. In case of Cisco IP Phone 8941 you can use the following:
LLDP SystemDescription attribute
CDP CachePlatform attribute
For our purpose it would be enough to obtain just one of those since both of them provide Certainty Factory increase of 70 and Minimum Certainty Factory required to be profiled as Cisco-IP-Phone-8941 is 70:
In order to be profiled as specific Cisco IP Phone, youneed to satisfy minimum conditions for all parent profiles. This means profiler needs to match Cisco-Device (min. Certainty Factor 10) and Cisco-IP-Phone (min. Certainty Factor 20). Even though profiler matches those two profiles, it should still be profiled as specific Cisco IP Phone since each IP Phone model has min. Certainty Factor of 70. Device is assigned to the profile for which it has highest Certainty Factor.
2. Configure two filter lists - one for CDP and another one for LLDP. Those indicate which attributes should be included in Radius accounting messages. This step is optional
3. Create two filter-specs for CDP and LLDP. In fiter spec you can either indicate that list of attributes should be included or excluded from accounting messages. In the example following attributes are included:
device-name from CDP
system-description from LLDP
You can configure additional attributes to be transmited via Radius to ISE if needed. This step is also optional.
4. Add command device-sensor notify all-changes. It triggers updates whenever TLVs are added, modified or removed for current session
5. In order to actually send the information gathered via Device Sensor functionality, you need to explicitly tell the switch to do so with command device-sensor accounting
!
device-sensor filter-list cdp list cdp-list
 tlv name device-name
 tlv name platform-type
!
device-sensor filter-list lldp list lldp-list
 tlv name system-description
!
device-sensor filter-spec lldp include list lldp-list
device-sensor filter-spec cdp include list cdp-list
!
device-sensor accounting
device-sensor notify all-changes
!
Step 3. Configure profiling on ISE
1. Add switch as a network device in "Administration>Network Resources>Network Devices". Use the radius server key from the switch as shared secret in Authentication Settings:
2. Enable Radius probe on the profiling node in "Administration>System>Deployment>ISE node>Profiling Configuration". If all PSN nodes should be used for profiling, enable the probe on all of them:
3. Configure ISE Authentication Rules. In the example the default authentication rules preconfigured on ISE are used:
4. Configure ISE Authorization Rules. 'Profiled Cisco IP Phones' rule is used, which is preconfigured on ISE:
Verify
In order to verify if profiling is working correctly, please refer to "Operations>Authentications" on ISE:
First the device was authenticated using MAB (18:49:00). Ten seconds later (18:49:10) it was reprofiled as Cisco-Device and finaly after 42 seconds since first authentications (18:49:42) it received Cisco-IP-Phone-8941 profile. As a result ISE returns Authorization Profile specific for IP Phones (Cisco_IP_Phones) and Downloadable ACL that permits all traffic (permit ip any any). Please note that in this scenario the unknown device has basic access to the network. It can be achieved by adding mac address to ISE internal endpoint database or allowing very basic network access for previously unknown devices.
Initial profiling took around 40 seconds in this example. On the next authentication ISE already knows the profile and correct attributes (permission to join voice domain and DACL) are applied instantly, unless ISE receives new/updated attributes and it needs to reprofile the device again.
 In "Administration>Identity Management>Identities>Endpoints>tested endpoint" you can see what kind of attributes were collected by Radius probe and what their values are:
As you can observe the total Certainty Factor computed is 210 in this scenario. It comes fromt the fact that endpoint matched also Cisco-Device profile (with total certainty factor of 30) and Cisco-IP-Phone profile (with total certainty factor of 40). Since profiler matched both conditions in profile Cisco-IP-Phone-8941, certainty factor for this profile is 140 (70 for each attribute according to profiling policy). To sum up: 30+40+70+70=210.

Check if CDP and LLDP protocols are enabled. Check if there are any non-default commands regarding CDP/LLDP/etc. and how those can affect attribute retrieval from the endpoint
switch#sh running-config all | in cdp run

switch#sh running-config all | in lldp run

If you do not see any data in this field or information is not complete verify 'device-sensor' commands, in particular filter-lists and filter-specs.
Step 3. Check if attributes are present in Radius Accounting
You can verify that using 'debug radius' command on the switch or performing packet capture between switch and ISE.

Packet capture:
Step 4. Verify profiler debugs on ISE
If the attributes were sent from the switch, it is possible to check if they were received on ISE. In order to check this, please enable profiler debugs for correct PSN node (Administration>System>Logging>Debug Log Configuration>PSN>profiler>debug) and perform authentication of the endpoint one more time.
Look for following information:

A forwarder stores endpoints into the Cisco ISE database along with their attributes data, and then notifies the analyzer of new endpoints detected on your network. The analyzer classifies endpoints to the endpoint identity groups and stores endpoints with the matched profiles in the database.
Step 5. Typically after new attributes are added to the existing collection for specific device, this device/endpoint is added to profiling queue in order to check if it has to be assigned different profile based on new attributes:
