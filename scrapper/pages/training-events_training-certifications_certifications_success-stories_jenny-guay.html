Meet Jenny Guay,
Senior Network Security Analyst
"I love the hunt for information—figuring out where a threat came from, what’s behind it, and who’s behind it. I find the whole investigation process really exciting and enjoyable."

Jenny's story
Learning to blaze my own trail
I have always been fascinated with computers and technology. I even disassembled a PC when I was a kid. Later, in high school, I enrolled in networking courses. That lead to my first certification, and I never looked back.
It was during my training for other certifications that I discovered cybersecurity. I was instantly fascinated. While attending cybersecurity community brunches, I shared experiences with other women in IT and learned about various security jobs.
Today, I work as a Senior Network Security Analyst. Through it all, one thing has remained true — my initiative has continued to shape my career and open new doors.

An unexpected opportunity arises
I decided I wanted to transition into cybersecurity. And when Cisco announced its Global Cybersecurity Scholarship Program (now discontinued), I didn’t wait for an engraved invitation. I pounced on the opportunity. I became one of the first persons to pass the exam and earn a CCNA CyberOps (now CyberOps Associate) certification.
Midway through my CCNA CyberOps studies, I learned of an opportunity at another company, working as its SOC operator. Busy as I was, I made time for the interview. The employer was impressed with how wellinformed I was. I knew the subject matter inside and out because it was precisely the material I had just studied during the Cisco course.
What does being a Cisco certification holder mean to you?
“The guidance I gained from earning the certification helped— in near real time—to determine what was happening on the job, when I became an SOC operator.”
So, what’s next on my long list of aspirations? I have my eyes trained on a Cisco CyberOps Professional certification. I’ve been in the industry for a while now, still love to learn, and the CyberOps Professional could serve as the pinnacle on my certification resume.
What would you tell a friend to pursue his Cisco Certification?
I'd tell them to know your stuff! Print out the exam objectives to identify your areas of need. I'd also suggest finding a study group, keep staying curious, and explore the knowledge rabbit holes.
What would you tell your younger self?
“I would tell myself to be sure to network. Take any chance to attend virtual meetups, engage with the people you admire on social media, and apply for any security job to gain interviewing experience.”
