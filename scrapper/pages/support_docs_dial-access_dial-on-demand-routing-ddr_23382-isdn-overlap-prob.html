Introduction
Cisco routers can receive an ISDN call in En bloc or Overlap modes. When configured for En bloc, the setup message should contain all necessary addressing information to route the call. In Overlap, the setup message does not contain the complete address. Additional information messages are required from the calling side to complete the called address.
A common pitfall when configuring a Cisco router to receive an ISDN call in Overlap mode is the incorrect configuration of the dial peer. This can cause the called number to be received incorrectly, causing the call to fail.

Prerequisites
Readers of this document should be knowledgeable of:
configuring ISDN on Cisco routers
basic knowledge of dial peers and Voice over IP (VoIP)
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
Cisco IOSÂ® Software Release 12.2.(7)a
C3640 router
The information presented in this document was created from devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If you are working in a live network, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command before using it.
Resolving the Unallocated/Unassigned Number Error
Configuring Overlap receiving on the D-channel changes the way routers behave when receiving ISDN calls. The router responds to the setup message with a SETUP ACK. This informs the network that it is ready to receive further information messages containing additional call routing elements.
The problem occurs when the destination number used in the dial peer is not of the same length as the called number being received. As shown below, the destination number is summarized to reflect a range of numbers that may start with the same digits:
The destination number range is 5000 through 5600.
The dial peer may be configured for destination pattern 5.
This type of dial plan works without problems in En bloc mode, but with Overlap receiving the router, it tries to place the call after enough digits have been received to match the destination number. In this case, after the 5 has been received. To prevent this from occurring the "T" terminator should be placed after the digits in the destination pattern. This causes the router to wait for the T302 timer to expire after each digit's reception, allowing the full number to be collected before placing the call.
Incorrect Configuration and Associated Debugs
This is an example of a configuration that cause calls to fail:

The debug ISDN Q931 and debug voip ccapi inout commands have been enabled. Some of the debugs were omitted for clarity.

Corrected Configuration and Debugs
In this example, the number being dialed is 5678. The dial peer has now been corrected with the addition of the "T" terminator. Also included in the Overlap configuration is the adjustment of the T302 timer to reflect a more realistic configuration. The default timer is 10 seconds, which may be too long in certain situations.
