    This document describes the features, issues, and deployment guidelines for Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator software.
Cisco Multi-Site is an architecture that allows you to interconnect separate Cisco APIC, Cloud Network Controller (formerly known as Cloud APIC), and NDFC (formerly known as DCNM) domains (fabrics) each representing a different region. This helps ensure multitenant Layer 2 and Layer 3 network connectivity across sites and extends the policy domain end-to-end across the entire system.
Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator is the intersite policy manager. It provides single-pane management that enables you to monitor the health of all the interconnected sites. It also allows you to centrally define the intersite configurations and policies that can then be pushed to the different Cisco APIC, Cloud Network Controller, or DCNM fabrics, which in term deploy them in those fabrics. This provides a high degree of control over when and where to deploy the configurations.

Note: The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.

New Software Features
This release adds the following new features:
Feature
Description
New support for 100 autonomous ACI sites and app schema/template deployment modes: Multi-Site or Autonomous
When creating Multi-Site application templates, you can now choose to designate the template as Autonomous. This allows you to associate the template to one or more sites that are operated independently and are not connected through an Inter-Site Network (no intersite VXLAN communication).
Because autonomous sites are by definition isolated and do not have any intersite connectivity, there is no shadow object configuration across sites and no cross-programming of pctags or VNIDs in the spine switches for intersite traffic flow. The autonomous templates also allow for significantly higher deployment scale.
For more information, see “Creating Schemas and Templates” in the Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator Configuration Guide for ACI Fabrics.
Four additional template types
The following additional templates are now available in Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator:
●      Tenant Policy templates can be used for managing tenant policies such as DHCP relay, QoS, Route-map.
●      Fabric Policy templates can be used for managing fabric and access policies, such as LLDP, CDP, PTP, NTP.
●      Fabric Resources Policy templates can be used for management fabric resources sites, switch nodes, interfaces.
These templates reference policies from the Fabric Policy templates.
●      Monitoring Policies templates can be used for managing SPAN sessions and supports Tenant and Access SPAN.
In addition, this release adds support for brownfield policies import and all template-level operations (such as versioning, rollback, cloning) with the exception of drift reconciliation.
For more information, see “Creating Schemas and Templates” in the Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator Configuration Guide for ACI Fabrics.
Several performance and usability improvements
●      Performance improvements for template deployments and scale.
●      Simplified UI for all templates, new sites tab and inventory screens
●      Improved audit logs for compliance
New Hardware Features
There is no new hardware supported in this release.
The complete list of supported hardware is available in the “Deploying Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator” chapter of the Cisco Multi-Site Deployment Guide.
Changes in Behavior
●      For all new deployments, you must install Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator service in Nexus Dashboard 2.1(2d) or later.
●      If you are upgrading to this release, you must back up your configuration, remove the existing Orchestrator instance, deploy this release, and then restore the configuration backup from your existing cluster.
Ensure that you follow the complete upgrade prerequisites, guidelines, and procedure are described in detail in the “Upgrading Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator” chapter of the Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator Deployment Guide.
●      Downgrading from Release 4.0(1) is not supported.
We recommend creating a full backup of the configuration before upgrading to Release 4.0(1), so that if you ever want to downgrade, you can deploy a brand-new cluster using an earlier version and then restore your configuration in it.
●      Beginning with Release 4.0(1), the “Application Profiles per Schema” scale limit has been removed.
For the full list of maximum verified scale limits, see the Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator Verified Scalability Guide.
●      Beginning with Release 4.0(1), if you have route leaking configured for a VRF, you must delete those configurations before you delete the VRF or undeploy the template containing that VRF.
●      Beginning with Release 4.0(1), if you are configuring EPG Preferred Group (PG), you must explicitly enable PG on the VRF.
In prior releases, enabling PG on an EPG automatically enabled the configuration on the associated VRF. For detailed information on configuring PG in Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator, see the “EPG Preferred Group” chapter of the Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator Configuration Guide for ACI Fabrics.
●      When deploying a subset of template policies, such as after a configuration change or update, the deployment time has been significantly improved.
●      Beginning with Cisco Cloud APIC release 25.0(5), Cisco Cloud APIC is renamed as Cisco Cloud Network Controller.
Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator can manage Cloud Network Controller sites the same way it managed Cloud APIC sites previously. For the full list of service and fabric compatibility options, see the Nexus Dashboard and Services Compatibility Matrix.

You may see the following error on Infra template deployment
Invalid Configuration CT_PROVIDER_MISMATCH.
4.0(1h)
CSCwb03980
For a BD in NDO schema, only the linked L3Out name is populated and the BD's L3Out Ref field remains empty even though the L3Out is managed by NDO.
This can be observed in UI when BD L3Out is edited, it does not show the complete path for the existing L3Out in the drop-down list.
It can also be observed in the Reconcile Drift UI where the BD's L3Out Ref is missing in the NDO schema tab and only the name is displayed.
4.0(1h)
CSCwa42423
Duplicate site entries are sent in the PUT request which is causing mongo DB error.
4.0(1h)
      CSCwb62378
Adding a new standalone cloud site without changing any on-premises parameters, may cause the deployment to push config for everything. The result is that the RID for BGP on-premises gets re-pushed and BGP table flushes causing about a 30 second disruption.
4.0(1h)
CSCwb81902
When EPG <A> is a provider for a service graph (SG) contract and EPG <A> is not stretched and only defined on site 1, the contract is pushed as "consumer" and "provider" for shadow EPG <A> on site 2.
That creates fault that SG contract can't be used as consumer and provider and SG deployment fails.
4.0(1h)
CSCwb90011
AWS sites only allow association with 2 Availability Zones, even though Cloud APIC 25.0.3k allows association with all zones.
As an example, for AWS North Virginia Region (us-east1):
●      From NDO, you may only be able to choose us-east-1a and us-east-1b
●      From Cloud APIC, you can choose all AZs in the region (us-east-1a to us-east-1f)
Note: If you configure us-east-1c zone from Cloud APiC and then import it into NDO,  the imported result on NDO shows empty zone.
4.0(1h)
CSCwb96351
When Onboarding Untrusted AWS Tenant, you must provide 3 items:
●      AWS Account ID
●      Access Key ID
●      Cloud Secret ID
Cloud Secret ID is not currently masked out. Even after submitting the values,  the values are visible later by going to Tenant config and hitting the edit button.
4.0(1h)
CSCwc11446
When pushing a local template in a schema, the stretched VRF becomes marked as a shadow object in ACI until the stretched template is pushed again.
4.0(1h)
CSCwc15163
UI may show error message if orderID for route maps for multicast is greater than 31.
4.0(1h)
CSCwc24706
Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator will not deploy a template that includes a contract configured with a service graph unless a subnet is configured under the EPG that is consuming the contract even if the service graph doesn't use PBR.
The consumer EPG subnet configuration is only required for service graphs "with PBR" that are stretched across sites. It is not needed if the service graph doesn't use PBR.
4.0(1h)
CSCwd22543
The traffic between on-premises InstP and cloudEPGs is affected when a template containing a subnet of cloud EPGs with contract to on-premises InstP is undeployed.
4.0(1h)

The upstream server may time out when enabling audit log streaming
CSCvd59276
For Cisco Multi-Site, Fabric IDs Must be the Same for All Sites, or the Querier IP address Must be Higher on One Site.
The Cisco APIC fabric querier functions have a distributed architecture, where each leaf switch acts as a querier, and packets are flooded. A copy is also replicated to the fabric port. There is an Access Control List (ACL) configured on each TOR to drop this query packet coming from the fabric port. If the source MAC address is the fabric MAC address, unique per fabric, then the MAC address is derived from the fabric-id. The fabric ID is configured by users during initial bring up of a pod site.
In the Cisco Multi-Site Stretched BD with Layer 2 Broadcast Extension use case, the query packets from each TOR get to the other sites and should be dropped. If the fabric-id is configured differently on the sites, it is not possible to drop them.
To avoid this, configure the fabric IDs the same on each site, or the querier IP address on one of the sites should be higher than on the other sites.
CSCvd61787
STP and "Flood in Encapsulation" Option are not Supported with Cisco Multi-Site.
In Cisco Multi-Site topologies, regardless of whether EPGs are stretched between sites or localized, STP packets do not reach remote sites. Similarly, the "Flood in Encapsulation" option is not supported across sites. In both cases, packets are encapsulated using an FD VNID (fab-encap) of the access VLAN on the ingress TOR. It is a known issue that there is no capability to translate these IDs on the remote sites.
CSCvi61260
If an infra L3Out that is being managed by Cisco Multi-Site is modified locally in a Cisco APIC, Cisco Multi-Site might delete the objects not managed by Cisco Multi-Site in an L3Out.
CSCvq07769
"Phone Number" field is required in all releases prior to Release 2.2(1). Users with no phone number specified in Release 2.2(1) or later will not be able to log in to the GUI when Orchestrator is downgraded to an earlier release.
CSCvu71584
Routes are not programmed on CSR and the contract config is not pushed to the Cloud site.
CSCvw47022
Shadow of cloud VRF may be unexpectedly created or deleted on the on-premises site.
CSCvt47568
Let's say APIC has EPGs with some contract relationships. If this EPG and the relationships are imported into NDO and then the relationship was removed and deployed to APIC, NDO doesn't delete the contract relationship on the APIC.
CSCwa31774
When creating VRFs in infra tenant on a Google Cloud site, you may see them classified as internal VRF in NDO. If you then import these VRFs in NDO, the allowed routeleak configuration will be determined based on whether the VRF is used for external connectivity (external VRF) or not (internal VRF).
This is because on cAPIC, VRFs in infra tenant can fall into 3 categories: internal, external and un-decided.
NDO treats infra tenant VRFs as 2 categories for simplicity: internal and external.
There is no usecase impacted because of this.
CSCwa47934
Removing site connectivity or changing the protocol is not allowed between two sites.
CSCwa52287
Template goes to approved state when the number of approvals is fewer than the required number of approvers.
CSCwc52360
When using APIs, template names must not include spaces.
CSCwa87027
After unmanaging an external fabric that contains route-servers, Infra Connectivity page in NDO still shows the route-servers.
Since the route-servers are still maintained, the overlay IFC from the route-servers to any BGW devices in the DCNM are not removed.
