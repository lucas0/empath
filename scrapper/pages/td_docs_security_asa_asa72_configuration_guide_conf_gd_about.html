Document Objectives
The purpose of this guide is to help you configure the security appliance using the command-line interface. This guide does not address every feature, but describes only the most common configurations.
You can also configure and monitor the security appliance by using ASDM, a web-based GUI application. ASDM includes configuration wizards to guide you through some common configuration scenarios, and online Help for less common scenarios. For more information, see the following URL:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6120/products_installation_and_configuration_guides_list.html
This guide applies to the Cisco PIX 500 series security appliances (PIX 515E, PIX 525, and PIX 535) and the Cisco ASA 5500 series security appliances (ASA 5505, ASA 5510, ASA 5520, ASA 5540, and ASA 5550). Throughout this guide, the term "security appliance" applies generically to all supported models, unless specified otherwise. The PIX 501, PIX 506E, and PIX 520 security appliances are not supported.
Audience
This guide is for network managers who perform any of the following tasks:
•Manage network security
•Install and configure firewalls/security appliances
•Configure VPNs
•Configure intrusion detection software
