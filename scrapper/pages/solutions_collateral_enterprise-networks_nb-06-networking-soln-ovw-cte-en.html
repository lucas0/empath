The changing landscape
Rapid change is today’s normal. Organizations are evolving their business models and adopting digital approaches faster than ever. Global and regional events are increasing the importance of business agility and resilience to business leaders in organizations large and small.
At the same time, technology does not stand still:
●      Technology innovation continues to accelerate — from the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to the Internet of Things (IoT), multicloud, 5G, ever expanding amounts of data, and increasingly complex cybersecurity threats. Innovations are changing the technology landscape at breakneck speed, creating new opportunities and risks.
●      Applications and services are being deconstructed and distributed everywhere inside and outside the traditional enterprise boundaries — from data centers in public-, private-, and hybrid-cloud environments all the way to branch offices and the remote edge. Containers and microservices are being quickly adopted for the greater digital agility they deliver, but they also introduce the opportunity for greater complexity and risk.
●      Users and devices are increasingly numerous, diverse, and distributed. The expanding use of diverse IoT devices, applications, and accompanying data is resulting in new distributed compute models, together with exponentially greater levels of scale and complexity. The mainstreaming of the hybrid work model means that workers need secure, reliable access everywhere. Mobile users expect immediate and high-performance connectivity at all times, everywhere, and on any device over Wi-Fi and public 4G and 5G networks.
●      Security and compliance are increasingly challenging. Threats are becoming more sophisticated, frequent, and dangerous across a broader attack surface that is no longer contained within well-defined perimeters. Mobility and cloud mean that over 60% of transactions begin or terminate outside the traditional enterprise boundary, leading to the broad adoption of a zero-trust security model.
The need for a new kind of network
In this environment, what should IT leaders be looking for in their new approach to networking? Architectures designed for agility, evolved lifecycle management models, and simpler consumption models to start with.
The traditional rigid and largely manual lifecycle management approach is no longer sustainable for deploying, maintaining, and updating networks, and it cannot scale to meet the growing complexity. For an organization to flourish in the digital economy, the network needs to be able to adapt quickly to changing business requirements or “intent.”
The network needs to support an increasingly diverse and fast-changing set of users, devices, applications, and services. It needs to ensure fast and secure access to and between the increasingly distributed workloads wherever they reside. And for the network to work optimally, all this needs to be achieved securely from end to end, between users, devices, apps, and services across each network domain — campus and branch access, WAN, data center, hybrid cloud, and multicloud. Which means that organizations need to continuously align the network — between users, devices, applications, and workloads everywhere — to application performance and security needs.
Figure 1.            
An unprecedented dynamic technology landscape is driving the need for a new networking model
This dynamic business and technology landscape is a reality for all organizations, their employees, and their customers, and is the engine and setting for the digital economy. So IT is feeling the pressure to address all these trends, often with a constrained budget and limited talent pool. Because the network is the common underlying tissue that enables users, devices, and applications to communicate and exchange data in this digital era, IT leaders are recognizing the importance of a drastically new network model.
Digital demands
The new network needs to:
Align to the business
Enable new digital business initiatives, not hold them back. The network needs the agility to quickly and dynamically realign with rapidly changing business objectives or unexpected disruptions.
Deal with growing complexity
Make the network easier to configure, operate, and maintain in the face of growing scale and complexity. Current operational models are not scalable or sustainable.
Assure service performance
Provide full visibility into how the network is operating across private and public internet and cloud networks. Assure that the network is supporting the desired user and application experience, identify any discrepancies, and recommend fixes.
Reduce risk
Adopt a zero-trust model to reduce security threats and identify and neutralize any threats that materialize before they cause harm. Multicloud, IoT, and mobile adoption open up new threat vectors that the network needs to constantly protect against.
Simplify the network lifecycle
Keep pace with your enterprise network’s expanding demands as technologies and requirements change by simplifying and streamlining how you acquire, consume, maintain, and update your network technology.
According to Gartner Research, “We believe a full IBNS implementation can reduce network infrastructure delivery times to the business leaders by 50% to 90%, while simultaneously reducing the number and duration of outages by at least 50%.”

Cisco Networking strategy
The Cisco Networking portfolio is designed to help IT keep up with all the demands of a modern organization. It’s built around a controller-based Intent-Based Network (IBN) architecture that delivers insights and automation to continuously learn and adapt to your organization’s needs.
Cisco Networking has the breadth and depth to serve the broadest range of networking needs across industries and segments. It spans access, WAN, data center, and cloud environments to interconnect users, devices, applications, and workloads anywhere. And it supports both cloud-based and on-premises management modes.
Figure 2.            
Cisco Networking: Providing the intelligent network architecture you need to securely connect, secure, and automate your digital business – from user to application in a cloud-first world
With IBN building on Software-Defined Networking (SDN) principles, your network transforms from a hardware-centric and manual approach to a software-centric and fully automated one that adds context, learning, and assurance capabilities. Your intent-based network captures business intent and uses analytics, machine learning, and automation to align the network continuously and dynamically to changing business needs. That means a closed-loop intent-based model that is continuously monitoring and assuring application and network performance requirements while applying and automating user, security, compliance, and IT operations policies across the whole network.
Business outcomes
By adopting the Cisco Networking portfolio, you can continuously deliver the consistent and secure networking services required to meet your organization’s most pressing needs:

Cisco Networking platform integrations and ecosystem
Cisco Networking platforms integrate across a broad range of cloud, endpoint, IT, and security technology partner systems. Likewise, with traditionally siloed network domains, organizations need a holistic network infrastructure strategy across the entire enterprise network.
It should be possible for IT and business intent to be expressed in one domain and then exchanged, enforced, and monitored across all of them. Cisco’s open-platform strategy provides policy integrations between access, WAN, data center, and cloud domains.
For example, Cisco ACI and Cisco SD-Access policy integration maps Cisco ACI’s application-based micro-segmentation in the data center with Cisco SD-Access’s user group-based segmentation across the campus and branch. Now security administrators can automate and manage end-to-end segmentation seamlessly with uniform access policies — from the user to the application. With such segmentation, policies can be set that allow IoT devices to access specific applications in the data center or allow only financial executives and auditors to access confidential data. This is just one example of how Cisco solutions are enabling consistent multidomain policy segmentation and assurance for end-to-end alignment to business intent.
In addition to simplifying NetOps and helping ensure full end-to-end monitoring and troubleshooting, Cisco Networking platforms integrate with the Cisco ThousandEyes internet and cloud monitoring system so that problems can be quickly identified and rectified regardless of whether the problem occurs on the private or public network.
