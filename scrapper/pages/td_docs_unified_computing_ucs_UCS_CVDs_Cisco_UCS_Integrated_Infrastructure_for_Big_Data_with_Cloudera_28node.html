Executive Summary
The technology that implements big data systems has matured to the point where it is in wide use across all industries addressing a wide variety of complex business problems; yet even as the technology has matured, the rate of data growth has increased. In addition, machine learning is gaining in prominence. Machine learning is a set of techniques for sophisticated pattern matching that came out of research into Artificial Intelligence. Machine learning needs all the data from the big data systems plus very high-performance computing.
Businesses are now faced with a new set of challenges, namely, making this data available to the diverse set of people who need it, publishing their results so the organization can make use of it, enabling the automated production of those results, while also managing the data for compliance and governance, and doing all of this in an efficient way that scales as the data continues to grow.
New, better solutions to old problems, and new applications, with new revenue streams, are now within grasp, but require approaches to hardware and software where agility is a primary design driver. IT organizations with traditional infrastructure and software solutions struggle to respond to changing business conditions and to manage this infrastructure. These environments require administrators to spend excessive time configuring new server, storage, and network resources in order to keep up with the scale demanded by growing computing and storage needs.
In addition, the introduction of machine learning into the mix adds new requirements. Many machine learning tasks, especially deep learning tasks, require the use of GPUs, a specialized, very high-performance processor that is massively parallel in nature. GPUs are installed on the servers and it is critically important that these high-performance processors also scale with the data growth.
Cisco UCS Integrated Infrastructure for Big Data and Analytics is an optimal choice where world class performance and reliability are base requirements. It is the strong foundation upon which solutions are built. The architecture has the designed-in ability to scale from a small starting solution to thousands of servers and hundreds of petabytes of storage, all managed from a single pane.
Cloudera Enterprise combines distributed data processing with machine learning and analytics into a single scalable platform that enables businesses to tackle their most complex problems. Cloudera is a leading provider of Apache Hadoop distributions and its integrated ecosystem of projects. These tools are used by companies around the world to tackle problems as diverse as predictive maintenance on fleets of hundreds of thousands of vehicles to real-time processing of petabyte-scale data for market surveillance and compliance on stock exchanges.
Together, Cisco and Cloudera combine to create a dependable deployment system to address todayâs most challenging problems.

Introduction
Both big data and machine learning technology have progressed to the point where they are being implemented in production systems running 24x7. There exists a very clear need for a proven, dependable, high-performance platform for the ingestion, processing, storage and analysis of the data, as well as the seamless dissemination of the output, results and insights of the analysis.
This solution implements the Cisco UCS Integrated Infrastructure for Big Data and Analytics, a world-class platform specifically designed for demanding workloads that is both easy to scale and easy to manage, even as the requirements grow to thousands of servers and petabytes of storage; and the Cloudera Data Science Workbench, an integrated set of tools designed to enable flexible, fast access to the entire data store.
Many companies, recognizing the immense potential of big data and machine learning technology, are gearing up to leverage these new capabilities, building out departments and increasing hiring. However, these efforts face a new set of challenges:
Â·         making the data available to the diverse set of people who need it,
Â·         enabling access to high-performance computing resources, GPUs, that also scale with the data growth
Â·         allowing people to work with the data using the environments they are familiar with,
Â·         publishing their results so the organization can make use of it,
Â·         enabling the automated production of those results,
Â·         managing the data for compliance and governance,
Â·         scaling the system as the data grows
Â·         managing and administering the system in an efficient, cost-effective way
This solution is based on the Cisco UCS Integrated Infrastructure for Big Data and Analytics and includes computing, storage, connectivity, and unified management capabilities to help companies manage the immense amount of data being collected. It is built on the Cisco Unified Computing System (Cisco UCS) infrastructure, using Cisco UCS 6332 Series Fabric Interconnects, and Cisco UCS C-Series Rack Servers. This architecture is specifically designed for performance and linear scalability for big data and machine learning workloads.

Cloudera Data Science Workbench
Cloudera Data Science Workbench (CDSW) is a web application that allows data scientists to use a variety of open source languages and libraries to directly and securely access the data in the Hadoop cluster. Direct access to the big data cluster means no more working with small subsets of the data on desktop systems; no sampling is required as the entire data set is available for use directly by the user. Further, users are not restricted to a single environment. Many popular open source libraries and languages are supported, including R, Python and Scala, which means users become productive faster with no need for retraining and no time lost learning a new programming language.
CDSW is addressing the key challenge that every team or user may require a different language, library or framework in order to be productive while the organization requires reproducibility and collaboration. By making the entire set of data in the cluster available to the user, CSDW eliminates the problem that what works on small samples or extracts of the data on a userâs desktop computer may not scale across a large cluster. Cloudera Data Science Workbench gives data scientists the flexibility and simplicity they need to be productive and innovative at scale.
In addition, CDSW enables seamless access to high-performance processors in the form of GPUs. CSDW makes use of lightweight container architecture to rapidly and securely provide the environment and resources to the users.
Cloudera Data Science Workbench is directly aimed at helping data scientists build and test new analyses and analytics projects as quickly as possible in secure manner even in large scale environments. This flexibility improves the efficiency of the exploration process, a key requirement to meet in order to move rapidly from idea to answer. Most analytics problems, especially those with transformative power, are not standard analyses and require advanced models and iterative methods. Experimentation and innovation are the heart and soul of data science, but security is needed for compliance and governance.
Data has become one of the most strategic assets in the organization. Leveraging the data to drive the business forward is the primary motivation for building an enterprise data hub to support advanced analytics. Typically, when forced to make a choice between the security of the data and the flexibility to access it, security wins locking away the data from the people who most need it. CDSW address this issue by providing full authentication and access controls against data in the cluster, including complete Kerberos integration. It offers data science teams per-project isolation and reproducibility with no effort.
Cloudera Data Science Workbench allows you to automate analytics workloads with a built-in job and pipeline scheduling system that supports real-time monitoring, job history, and email alerts. Jobs are created and can be configured to run on a recurring schedule, as well as providing alerts for successful and failed runs. Multiple jobs can be scheduled together to create an automated pipeline; e.g., the first job performs data acquisition, the next data cleansing, then analytics, and so on.
Collaboration and sharing of results are implemented via project sharing (either globally or to specific users, and project forking. To share results, CSDW enables publishing output for viewing via a browser, and even makes the console log itself available for viewing both during and after the run. Cloudera Data Science Workbench is a web application. It has no desktop footprint making it very easy to administer and maintain.
NVIDIA GPU
Graphics Processing Units, or GPUs, are specialized processors designed to render images, animation and video for computer displays. They perform this task by running many operations simultaneously. While the number and kinds of operations they can do are limited, they make up for it by being able run many thousands in parallel. As the graphics capabilities of GPUs increased, it soon became apparent that the massive parallelism of GPUs could be put to other uses beside rendering graphics.
NVIDIAÂ® GPU used in this document, NVIDIA TeslaÂ® V100 is advanced data center GPU built to accelerate AI, HPC, and graphics. Itâs powered by NVIDIA Volta architecture, comes in 16 and 32 GB configurations.
NVIDIA GPUs bring two key advantages to the table. First, they make possible solutions that were simply not computationally possible before. Second, by providing the same processing power as scores of traditional CPUs they reduce the requirements for rack space, power, networking and cooling in the data center.

Cisco UCS Manager
Cisco UCS Manager resides within the Cisco UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnect. It makes the system self-aware and self-integrating, managing all of the system components as a single logical entity. Cisco UCS Manager can be accessed through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), a command-line interface (CLI), or an XML application-programming interface (API). Cisco UCS Manager uses service profiles to define the personality, configuration, and connectivity of all resources within Cisco UCS, radically simplifying provisioning of resources so that the process takes minutes instead of days. This simplification allows IT departments to shift their focus from constant maintenance to strategic business initiatives.
NVIDIA CUDA
GPUs are very good at running the same operation on different data simultaneously. This is often referred to as single instruction, multiple data, or SIMD. This is exactly whatâs needed to render graphics but many other computing problems can benefit from this approach. As a result, NVIDIA created CUDA. CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model that makes it possible to use a GPU for many general purpose computing tasks via commonly used programming languages like C and C++.
In addition to the general-purpose computing capabilities that CUDA enables there is also a special CUDA library for deep learning called the CUDA Deep Neural Network library, or cuDNN. cuDNN makes it easier to implement deep machine learning architectures that take full advantage of the GPUâs capabilities.

It also includes the Cloudera Manager API, which can be used to obtain cluster health information and metrics, as well as configure Cloudera Manager.
Â·         Cloudera NavigatorâAn end-to-end data management tool for the CDH platform. Cloudera Navigator enables administrators, data managers, and analysts to explore the large amounts of data in Hadoop. The robust auditing, data management, lineage management, and life cycle management in Cloudera Navigator allow enterprises to adhere to stringent compliance and regulatory requirements.
Cloudera Data Science Workbench
Cloudera Data Science Workbench (CDSW) is a web application that allows data scientists to use a variety of open source languages and libraries to directly and securely access the data in the Hadoop cluster. Direct access to the big data cluster means no more working with small subsets of the data on desktop systems; no sampling is required as the entire data set is available for use directly by the user. Further, users are not restricted to a single environment. Many popular open source libraries and languages are supported, including R, Python and Scala, as well as all of the ML/DL frameworks such as TensorFlow, Theano, Pytorch, etc. In addition, CDSW enables access to available GPU resources for deep learning workloads.
Docker Containers
Cloudera Data Science Workbench makes use of container technology. Containers are conceptually similar to virtual machines, but instead of virtualizing the hardware, a container virtualizes the operating system. With a VM there is an entire operating system sitting on top of the hypervisor. Containers dispense with this time-consuming and resource hungry requirement by sharing the host systemâs kernel. As a result, a container is far smaller, and its lightweight nature means they can be instantiated quickly. In fact, they can be instantiated so quickly that new application architectures are possible.
Docker is an open-source project based on Linux containers. It uses Linux kernel features like namespaces and control groups to create containers. These features are not new, but Docker has taken these concepts and improved them in the following ways:
Â·         Ease of use: Docker makes easier for anyoneâââdevelopers, systems admins, architects and othersâââto take advantage of containers in order to quickly build and test portable applications. It allows anyone to package an application on their development system, which can then run unmodified on any cloud or bare metal server. The basic idea is to create a âbuild once, run anywhereâ system.
Â·         Speed: Docker containers are very fast with a small footprint. Ultimately, containers are just sandboxed environments running on the kernel so they take up few resources. You can create and run a Docker container in seconds. Compare this to a VM which takes much longer because it has to boot up a full virtual operating system every time.
Â·         Modularity: Docker makes it easy to take an application and breaks its functionality into separate individual containers. These containers can then be spun up and run as needed. This is particularly useful for cases where an application needs to hold and lock a particular resource, like a GPU, and then release it once itâs done using it. Modularity also enables each component, i.e., container to be updated independently.
Â·         Scalability: modularity enables scalability. With different parts of the system running in different containers it becomes possible, and with Docker, it becomes easy to connect these containers together to create an application, which can then be scaled out as needed.
Kubernetes
Applications built using container technology provide a great deal of flexibility in terms of their architecture, deployment and scaling. Since containers provide VM-like separation of concerns but with far less overhead they allow system developers to package different services of the same application into separate containers. These containers can then be deployed in a very flexible manner including across clusters of physical and virtual machines. This builds the ability to scale directly into the application architecture. This ability in turn requires a tool to aid in deploying, managing and scaling container-based applications.
Kubernetes is an open source project specifically designed for deploying and managing multi-container applications at scale. Kubernetes automates and simplifies the following tasks:
Â·         Deploying multi-container applications. With the application split into separate containers for different services, Kubernetes manages the deployment of the containers both at initial startup and in real-time as needed by the application.
Â·         Scaling containers. Applications need to spin up and down containers to suit demand, to balance incoming load, and make better use of physical resources. Kubernetes provides the mechanisms for doing these things in a completely automated way.
Â·         Updating applications. One advantage of container-based application development is the ability to independently change, improve and fix individual containers. Kubernetes has mechanisms for allowing graceful updates to new versions of container images, including rollbacks if something does not go as planned.
Kubernetes manages application status and any replication and load balancing needs. It also handles hardware resource allocation including GPUs. Kubernetes also has facilities for maximizing the use of hardware resources including memory, storage I/O, and network bandwidth. Applications can have soft and hard limits set on their resource usage. For example, many small applications that use minimal resources can be run together on the same hardware while resource hungry applications can be placed on different hardware and scale out as needed.

Post OS Install Configuration
Choose one of the nodes of the cluster or a separate node as the Admin Node for management such as CDH installation, cluster parallel shell, creating a local Red Hat repo and others. In this document, we use rhel1 for this purpose.
Setting Up Password-less Login
To manage all of the clusters nodes from the admin node password-less login needs to be setup. It assists in automating common tasks with clustershell (clush, a cluster wide parallel shell), and shell-scripts without having to use passwords.
When Red Hat Linux is installed across all the nodes in the cluster, to enable password-less login across all the nodes, complete the following steps:
1.    Login to the Admin Node (rhel1).
#ssh 10.13.1.50
2.    Run the ssh-keygen command to create both public and private keys on the admin node.
3.    Then run the following command from the admin node to copy the public key id_rsa.pub to all the nodes of the cluster.  ssh-copy-id appends the keys to the remote-hostâs  .ssh/authorized_keys.
#for IP in {50..73}; do echo -n "$IP -> "; ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 10.13.1.$IP; done
#for IP in {250..253}; do echo -n "$IP -> "; ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 10.13.1.$IP; done
4.    Enter yes for Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
5.    Enter the password of the remote host.
Configuring /etc/hosts
Setup /etc/hosts on the Admin node; this is a pre-configuration to setup DNS as shown in the next section.
To create the host file on the admin node, complete the following steps:
1.    Populate the host file with IP addresses and corresponding hostnames on the Admin node (rhel1) and other nodes as follows:
2.    On Admin Node (rhel1):
#vi /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 \ localhost4.localdomain4
::1 localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 \ localhost6.localdomain6
  10.13.1.50 rhel1

10.13.1.252 cdsw3.cisco.com
10.13.1.253 cdsw4.cisco.com
Creating a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.4 Local Repo
To create a repository using RHEL DVD or ISO on the admin node (in this deployment rhel1 is used for this purpose), create a directory with all the required RPMs, run the createrepo command and then publish the resulting repository.
1.    Log on to rhel1. Create a directory that would contain the repository.
   #mkdir -p /var/www/html/rhelrepo
2.    Copy the contents of the Red Hat DVD to /var/www/html/rhelrepo
3.    Alternatively, if you have access to a Red Hat ISO Image, Copy the ISO file to rhel1.
4.    Log back into rhel1 and create the mount directory.
#scp rhel-server-7.4-x86_64-dvd.iso rhel1:/root/
  #mkdir -p /mnt/rheliso
#mount -t iso9660 -o loop /root/rhel-server-7.4-x86_64-dvd.iso /mnt/rheliso/
5.    Copy the contents of the ISO to the /var/www/html/rhelrepo directory.
#cp -r /mnt/rheliso/* /var/www/html/rhelrepo
6.    On rhel1 create a .repo file to enable the use of the yum command.
#vi /var/www/html/rhelrepo/rheliso.repo
[rhel7.4]
name=Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4
baseurl=http://10.13.1.50/rhelrepo
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1
7.    Copy rheliso.repo file from /var/www/html/rhelrepo  to /etc/yum.repos.d on rhel1.
#cp /var/www/html/rhelrepo/rheliso.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/
          Note: Based on this repo file yum requires httpd to be running on rhel1 for other nodes to access the repository.
8.    To make use of repository files on rhel1 without httpd, edit the baseurl of repo file /etc/yum.repos.d/rheliso.repo to point repository location in the file system.
          Note: This step is needed to install software on Admin Node (rhel1) using the repo (such as httpd, create-repo, etc.)
#vi /etc/yum.repos.d/rheliso.repo
[rhel7.4]
name=Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4
baseurl=file:///var/www/html/rhelrepo
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1
Creating the Red Hat Repository Database
1.    Install the createrepo package on admin node (rhel1). Use it to regenerate the repository database(s) for the local copy of the RHEL DVD contents.
#yum -y install createrepo
2.    Run createrepo on the RHEL repository to create the repo database on admin node
#cd /var/www/html/rhelrepo
#createrepo .
Setting up ClusterShell
ClusterShell (or clush) is the cluster-wide shell that runs commands on several hosts in parallel. To set up the ClusterShell, complete the following steps:
1.    From the system connected to the Internet download Cluster shell (clush) and install it on rhel1. Cluster shell is available from EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) repository.
#wget http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3/stat/4/idpl/31529309/dir/redhat_el_7/com/clustershell-1.7-1.el7.noarch.rpm.html
#scp clustershell-1.7-1.el7.noarch.rpm rhel1:/root/
Login to rhel1 and install cluster shell.
#yum ây install clustershell-1.71.el7.noarch.rpm
2.    Edit /etc/clustershell/groups.d/local.cfg file to include hostnames for all the nodes of the cluster. This set of hosts is taken when running clush with the â-aâ option.
3.    For 28 node cluster as in our CVD, set groups file as follows:
#vi /etc/clustershell/groups.d/local.cfg
all: rhel[1-24],cdsw1.cisco.com, cdsw2.cisco.com, cdsw3.cisco.com, cdsw4.cisco.com
            Note: For more information and documentation on ClusterShell, visit https://github.com/cea-hpc/clustershell/wiki/UserAndProgrammingGuide.
            Note: clustershell will not work if not ssh to the machine earlier (as it requires to be in known_hosts file), for instance, as in the case below for rhel<host>.
Installing httpd
Setting up RHEL repo on the admin node requires httpd. To set up RHEL repository on the admin node, complete the following steps:
1.    Install httpd on the admin node to host repositories.
The Red Hat repository is hosted using HTTP on the admin node, this machine is accessible by all the hosts in the cluster.
#yum ây install httpd
2.    Add ServerName and make the necessary changes to the server configuration file.
   #vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
    ServerName 10.13.1.50:80
3.    Start httpd
#service httpd start
#chkconfig httpd on
Set Up All Nodes to use the RHEL Repository
          Note: Based on this repo file yum requires httpd to be running on rhel1 for other nodes to access the repository.
1.    Copy the rheliso.repo to all the nodes of the cluster.
#clush -w rhel[1-24],cdsw[1-4].cisco.com -b -c /var/www/html/rhelrepo/rheliso.repo --dest=/etc/yum.repos.d/
2.    Also copy the /etc/hosts file to all nodes.
   #clush âa -b -c /etc/hosts â-dest=/etc/hosts
3.    Purge the yum caches after this
#clush -a -B yum clean all
#clush âa âB yum repolist
            Note: While suggested configuration is to disable SELinux as shown below, if for any reason SELinux needs to be enabled on the cluster, then ensure to run the following to make sure that the httpd is able to read the Yum repofiles.
  #chcon -R -t httpd_sys_content_t /var/www/html/
Configuring DNS
This section details setting up DNS using dnsmasq as an example based on the /etc/hosts configuration setup in the earlier section.
To create the host file across all the nodes in the cluster, complete the following steps:
1.    Disable Network manager on all nodes.
#clush -a -b service NetworkManager stop
#clush -a -b chkconfig NetworkManager off
2.    Update /etc/resolv.conf file to point to Admin Node.
#vi /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver 10.13.1.50
          Note: Cloudera CDSW requires Wildcard entry dns configurations as detailed in section Cloudera Data Science Workbench.
            Note: Alternatively #systemctl start NetworkManager.service can be used to start the service. #systemctl stop NetworkManager.service can be used to stop the service. Use #systemctl disable NetworkManager.service to stop a service from being automatically started at boot time.
3.    Install and Start dnsmasq on Admin node
#service dnsmasq start
#chkconfig dnsmasq on
4.    Deploy  /etc/resolv.conf from the admin node (rhel1) to all the nodes via the following clush command:
#clush -a -B -c /etc/resolv.conf
          Note: A clush copy without âdest copies to the same directory location as the source-file directory.
5.    Make sure DNS is working fine by running the following command on Admin node and any data-node
[root@rhel2 ~]# nslookup rhel1
Server:  10.13.1.50
Address: 10.13.1.50#53
Name:    rhel1
Address: 10.13.1.50 Ã§
          Note: yum install ây bind-utils will need to be run for nslookup to utility to run.
Upgrading the Cisco Network Driver for VIC1387
The latest Cisco Network driver is required for performance and updates. The latest drivers can be downloaded from the link below:
https://software.cisco.com/download/home/286318800/type/283853158/release/3.1%25283%2529
In the ISO image, the required driver kmod-enic-2.3.0.44-rhel7u4.el7.x86_64.rpm can be located at \Linux\Network\Cisco\VIC\RHEL\RHEL7.4.
1.    From a node connected to the Internet, download, extract and transfer kmod-enic-2.3.0.44-rhel7u4.el7.x86_64.rpm to rhel1 (admin node).
2.    Install the rpm on all nodes of the cluster using the following clush commands. For this example, the rpm is assumed to be in present working directory of rhel1.
3.    [root@rhel1 ~]# clush -a -b -c kmod-enic-2.3.0.44-rhel7u4.el7.x86_64.rpm
4.    [root@rhel1 ~]# clush -a -b "rpm âivh kmod-enic-2.3.0.44-rhel7u4.el7.x86_64.rpm "
5.    Make sure that the above installed version of kmod-enic driver is being used on all nodes by running the command "modinfo enic" on all nodes
[root@rhel1 ~]# clush -a -B "modinfo enic | head -5"
6.    Also it is recommended to download the kmod-megaraid driver for higher performance , the RPM can be found in the same package at \Linux\Storage\LSI\Cisco_Storage_12G_SAS_RAID_controller\RHEL\RHEL7.4
Installing xfsprogs
From the admin node rhel1 run the command shown below to Install  xfsprogs on all the nodes for xfs filesystem.
#clush -a -B yum -y install xfsprogs
   NTP Configuration
The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize the time of all the nodes within the cluster. The Network Time Protocol daemon (ntpd) sets and maintains the system time of day in synchronism with the timeserver located in the admin node (rhel1). Configuring NTP is critical for any Hadoop Cluster. If server clocks in the cluster drift out of sync, serious problems will occur with HBase and other services.
#clush âa âb "yum ây install ntp"
          Note: Installing an internal NTP server keeps your cluster synchronized even when an outside NTP server is inaccessible.
1.    Configure /etc/ntp.conf on the admin node only with the following contents:
#vi /etc/ntp.conf
driftfile /var/lib/ntp/drift
restrict 127.0.0.1
restrict -6 ::1
server 127.127.1.0
fudge 127.127.1.0 stratum 10
includefile /etc/ntp/crypto/pw
keys /etc/ntp/keys
2.    Create /root/ntp.conf on the admin node and copy it to all nodes:
#vi /root/ntp.conf
server 10.13.1.50
driftfile /var/lib/ntp/drift
restrict 127.0.0.1
restrict -6 ::1
includefile /etc/ntp/crypto/pw
keys /etc/ntp/keys
3.    Copy ntp.conf file from the admin node to /etc of all the nodes by executing the following commands in the admin node (rhel1)
#for SERVER in {50..73}; do scp /root/ntp.conf 10.13.1.$SERVER:/etc/ntp.conf; done
#for SERVER in {250..253}; do scp /root/ntp.conf 10.13.1.$SERVER:/etc/ntp.conf; done
4.    Run the following to syncronize the time and restart NTP daemon on all nodes.
#clush -a -b "service ntpd stop"
#clush -a -b "ntpdate rhel1"
#clush -a -b "service ntpd start"
5.    Make sure to restart of NTP daemon across reboots:
#clush âa âb "systemctl enable ntpd"
            Alternatively, the new Chrony service can be installed, that is quicker to synchronize clocks in mobile and virtual systems.
6.    Install the Chrony service:
# yum install -y chrony
7.    Activate the Chrony service at boot:
8.    # systemctl enable chronyd
9.    Start the Chrony service:
# systemctl start chronyd
  The Chrony configuration is in the /etc/chrony.conf file, configured similar to /etc/ntp.conf.
Enabling Syslog
Syslog must be enabled on each node to preserve logs regarding killed processes or failed jobs. Modern versions such as syslog-ng and rsyslog are possible, making it more difficult to be sure that a syslog daemon is present. One of the following commands should suffice to confirm that the service is properly configured:
#clush -B -a rsyslogd âv
#clush -B -a service rsyslog status
Setting ulimit
On each node, ulimit -n specifies the number of inodes that can be opened simultaneously. With the default value of 1024, the system appears to be out of disk space and shows no inodes available. This value should be set to 64000 on every node.
Higher values are unlikely to result in an appreciable performance gain.
1.    For setting the ulimit on Redhat, edit  /etc/security/limits.conf on admin node rhel1 and add the following lines:
root soft nofile 64000
root hard nofile 64000
2.    Copy the /etc/security/limits.conf file from admin node (rhel1) to all the nodes using the following command.
#clush -a -b -c /etc/security/limits.conf --dest=/etc/security/
  3.    Make sure that the /etc/pam.d/su file contains the following settings:
#%PAM-1.0
auth            sufficient      pam_rootOK.so
# Uncomment the following line to implicitly trust users in the "wheel" group.
#auth           sufficient      pam_wheel.so trust use_uid
# Uncomment the following line to require a user to be in the "wheel" group.
#auth           required        pam_wheel.so use_uid
auth            include         system-auth
account         sufficient      pam_succeed_if.so uid = 0 use_uid quiet
account         include         system-auth
password        include         system-auth
session         include         system-auth
session         optional        pam_xauth.so
          Note: The ulimit values are applied on a new shell, running the command on a node on an earlier instance of a shell will show old values.
Disabling SELinux
SELinux must be disabled during the install procedure and cluster setup. SELinux can be enabled after installation and while the cluster is running.
SELinux can be disabled by editing /etc/selinux/config and changing the SELINUX line to SELINUX=disabled. The following command will disable SELINUX on all nodes.
#clush -a -b "sed âi 's/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=disabled/g' /etc/selinux/config"
#clush âa âb "setenforce 0"
          Note: The above command may fail if SELinux is already disabled.
Reboot the machine, if needed for SELinux to be disabled in case it does not take effect. It can checked using
#clush âa âb sestatus
Set TCP Retries
Adjusting the tcp_retries parameter for the system network enables faster detection of failed nodes. Given the advanced networking features of UCS, this is a safe and recommended change (failures observed at the operating system layer are most likely serious rather than transitory). On each node, set the number of TCP retries to 5 can help detect unreachable nodes with less latency.
1.    Edit the file /etc/sysctl.conf and on admin node rhel1 and add the following lines:
net.ipv4.tcp_retries2=5
2.    Copy the /etc/sysctl.conf file from admin node (rhel1) to all the nodes using the following command:
#clush -a -b -c /etc/sysctl.conf --dest=/etc/
3.    Load the settings from default sysctl file /etc/sysctl.conf by running.
#clush -B -a sysctl -p
Disabling the Linux Firewall
The default Linux firewall settings are far too restrictive for any Hadoop deployment. Since the UCS Big Data deployment will be in its own isolated network there is no need for that additional firewall.
#clush -a -b " firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=80/tcp --permanent"
#clush -a -b "firewall-cmd --reload"
#clush âa âb âsystemctl disable firewalldâ
Disable Swapping
1.    In order to reduce Swapping, run the following on all nodes. Variable vm.swappiness defines how often swap should be used, 60 is default.
#clush -a -b " echo 'vm.swappiness=1' >> /etc/sysctl.conf"
2.    Load the settings from default sysctl file /etc/sysctl.conf.
#clush âa âb "sysctl âp"
Disable Transparent Huge Pages
Disabling Transparent Huge Pages (THP) reduces elevated CPU usage caused by THP.
#clush -a -b "echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabledâ
#clush -a -b "echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag"
1.    The above commands must be run for every reboot, so copy this command to /etc/rc.local so they are executed automatically for every reboot.
2.    On the Admin node, run the following commands:
#rm âf /root/thp_disable
#echo "echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled" >>
/root/thp_disable
#echo "echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag " >>
/root/thp_disable
3.    Copy file to each node:
#clush âa âb âc /root/thp_disable
4.    Append the content of file thp_disable to /etc/rc.local:
#clush -a -b âcat /root/thp_disable >> /etc/rc.localâ
Disable IPv6 Defaults
1.    Disable IPv6 as the addresses used are IPv4.
#clush -a -b "echo 'net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1' >> /etc/sysctl.conf"
#clush -a -b "echo 'net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1' >> /etc/sysctl.conf"
#clush -a -b "echo 'net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1' >> /etc/sysctl.conf"
2.    Load the settings from default sysctl file /etc/sysctl.conf.
#clush âa âb "sysctl âp"
Configuring Data Drives on Name Node And Other Management Nodes
This section describes steps to configure non-OS disk drives as RAID1 using StorCli command as described below. All the drives are going to be part of a single RAID1 volume. This volume can be used for Staging any client data to be loaded to HDFS. This volume will not be used for HDFS data.
1.    From the website download storcli https://www.broadcom.com/support/download-search/?pg=&pf=&pn=&po=&pa=&dk=storcli
2.    Extract the zip file and copy storcli-007.0504.0000.0000-1.noarch.rpm from the linux directory.
3.    Download storcli and its dependencies and transfer to Admin node.
#scp storcli-007.0504.0000.0000-1.noarch.rpm rhel1:/root/
4.    Copy storcli rpm to all the nodes using the following commands:
#clush -a -b -c /root/storcli-007.0504.0000.0000-1.noarch.rpm --dest=/root/
5.    Run the below command to install storcli on all the nodes
#clush -a -b ârpm -ivh storcli-007.0504.0000.0000-1.noarch.rpmâ
6.    Run the below command to copy storcli64 to root directory.
#cd /opt/MegaRAID/storcli/
#cp storcli64 /root/
7.    Copy storcli64  to all the nodes using the following commands:
#clush -a -b -c /root/storcli64 --dest=/root/
8.    Run the following script as root user on rhel1 to rhel3 to create the virtual drives for the management nodes.
#vi /root/raid1.sh
./storcli64 -cfgldadd r1[$1:1,$1:2,$1:3,$1:4,$1:5,$1:6,$1:7,$1:8,$1:9,$1:10,$1:11,$1:12,$1:13,$1:14,$1:15,$1:16,$1:17,$1:18,$1:19,$1:20,$1:21,$1:22,$1:23,$1:24,$1:25,$1:26] wb ra nocachedbadbbu strpsz1024 -a0
The above script requires enclosure ID as a parameter.
9.    Run the following command to get enclosure id.
#./storcli64 pdlist -a0 | grep Enc | grep -v 252 | awk '{print $4}' | sort | uniq -c | awk '{print $2}'
#chmod 755 raid1.sh
10.  Run MegaCli script as follows.
#./raid1.sh <EnclosureID> obtained by running the command above
WB: Write back
RA: Read Ahead
NoCachedBadBBU: Do not write cache when the BBU is bad.
Strpsz1024: Strip Size of 1024K
          Note: The command above will not override any existing configuration. To clear and reconfigure existing configurations refer to Embedded MegaRAID Software Users Guide available at www.broadcom.com.
Cloudera recommends the following disk configuration for the master nodes:
Â·         At least 10 physical disks in following configuration
Â·         2 x RAID1 OS (Root disk)
Â·         4 x RAID 10 (DB filesystems)
Â·         2 x RAID 1 HDFS NameNode metadata
Â·         1 x JBOD - ZooKeeper
Â·         1 x JBOD - Quorum JournalNode
Configuring Data Drives on Data Nodes
To configure non-OS disk drives as individual RAID0 volumes using StorCli command, complete the following steps. These volumes are going to be used for HDFS Data.
1.    Issue the following command from the admin node to create the virtual drives with individual RAID 0 configurations on all the data nodes.
#clush âw rhel[4-24] -B ./storcli64 -cfgeachdskraid0 WB RA direct NoCachedBadBBU strpsz1024 -a0
WB: Write back
RA: Read Ahead
NoCachedBadBBU: Do not write cache when the BBU is bad. 
Strpsz1024: Strip Size of 1024K
          Note: Create Raid 1 for the Cloudera Data Science workbench nodes as shown as management nodes.
            Note: The command above will not override existing configurations. To clear and reconfigure existing configurations refer to Embedded MegaRAID Software Users Guide available at www.broadcom.com.
Configuring the Filesystem for NameNodes and Datanodes
The following script will format and mount the available volumes on each node whether it is Namenode or Data node. OS boot partition is going to be skipped. All drives are mounted based on their UUID as /data/disk1, /data/disk2, etc. To configure the filesystem for NameNodes and DataNodes, complete the following steps:
1.    On the Admin node, create a file containing the following script.
2.    To create partition tables and file systems on the local disks supplied to each of the nodes, run the following script as the root user on each node.
          Note: The script assumes there are no partitions already existing on the data volumes. If there are partitions, delete them before running the script. This process is documented in the "Note" section at the end of the section.
#vi /root/driveconf.sh

((count++))
fi
done
          Note: Do not run this script on the Cloudera Data Science Workbench nodes
3.    Run the following command to copy driveconf.sh to all the nodes:
#chmod 755 /root/driveconf.sh
#clush âa -B âc /root/driveconf.sh
4.    Run the following command from the admin node to run the script across all data nodes
#clush âa âB /root/driveconf.sh
5.    Run the following from the admin node to list the partitions and mount points
#clush âa -B df âh
#clush âa -B mount
#clush âa -B cat /etc/fstab
          Note: If there is a need to delete any partitions, it can be done so using the following.
6.    Run the mount command (âmountâ) to identify which drive is mounted to which device /dev/sd<?>
7.    umount the drive for which partition is to be deleted and run fdisk to delete as shown below.
          Note: Care should be taken not to delete the OS partition as this will wipe out the OS.
#mount
#umount /data/disk1 Ã§ (disk1 shown as example)
#(echo d; echo w;) | sudo fdisk /dev/sd<?>
Cluster Verification
This section describes the steps to create the script cluster_verification.sh that helps to verify the CPU, memory, NIC, and storage adapter settings across the cluster on all nodes.

Cloudera Manager Installation
The following section describes installation of Cloudera Manager first and then using Cloudera Manager to install CDH 5.13.0.
Setting Up the Cloudera Manager Server Database
The Cloudera Manager Server Database stores information about service and host configurations.
Installing Cloudera Manager
Cloudera Manager, an end to end management application, is used to install and configure CDH. During CDH Installation, Cloudera Manager's Wizard will help to install Hadoop services on all nodes using the following procedure:
Â·         Discovery of the cluster nodes
Â·         Configure the Cloudera parcel or package repositories
Â·         Install Hadoop, Cloudera Manager Agent (CMA) and Impala on all the cluster nodes.
Â·         Install the Oracle JDK if it is not already installed across all the cluster nodes.
Â·         Assign various services to nodes.
Â·         Start the Hadoop services.
To install Cloudera Manager, complete the following steps:
1.    Update the repo files to point to local repository.
#rm -f /var/www/html/clouderarepo/*.repo
#cp /etc/yum.repos.d/c*.repo /var/www/html/clouderarepo/
2.    Install the Oracle Java Development Kit on the Cloudera Manager Server host.
3.    #yum install oracle-j2sdk1.7
4.    Install the Cloudera Manager Server packages either on the host where the database is installed, or on a host that has access to the database.
#yum install cloudera-manager-daemons cloudera-manager-server
Preparing a Cloudera Manager Server External Database
1.    Run the scm_prepare_database.sh script on the host where the Cloudera Manager Server package is installed (rhel1) admin node.
#cd /usr/share/cmf/schema
#./scm_prepare_database.sh mysql amon root <password>
#./scm_prepare_database.sh mysql rman root <password>
#./scm_prepare_database.sh mysql metastore root <password>
#./scm_prepare_database.sh mysql nav root <password>
#./scm_prepare_database.sh mysql navms root <password>
#./scm_prepare_database.sh mysql sentry root <password>
#./scm_prepare_database.sh mysql oozie root <password>
2.    Verify the database connectivity using the following command.
[root@rhel1 ~]# mysql âu root âp
mysql> connect amon

    Setting up the Database
The role assignment recommendation above is for clusters of up to 64 servers. For clusters larger than 64 nodes, use the HA recommendation defined in Table 7above.
1.    In the Database Host Name sections use port 3306 for TCP/IP because connection to the remote server always uses TCP/IP.
2.    Enter the Database Name, username and password that were used during the database creation stage earlier in this document.
3.    Click Test Connection to verify the connection and click Continue.

Figure 32     Installation Completion
Cloudera Manager now displays the status of all Hadoop services running on the cluster.

  Figure 33     Service Status of the Cluster
Scaling the Cluster
The role assignment recommendation above is for cluster with at least 64 servers and in High Availability (HA). For smaller cluster running without HA the recommendation is to dedicate one server for NameNode and a second server for secondary name node and YARN Resource Manager. For larger clusters larger than 28 nodes the recommendation is to dedicate one server each for name node, YARN Resource Manager and one more for running both NameNode (HA) and Resource Manager (HA) as in the table (no Secondary NameNode when in HA).
For production clusters it is recommended to set up NameNode and Resource manager in HA mode.
This implies that there will be at least 3 master nodes, running the NameNode, YARN Resource manager, the failover counter-part being designated to run on another node and a third node that would have similar capacity as the other two nodes.
All the three nodes will also need to run zookeeper and quorum journal node services. It is also recommended to have a minimum of 5 DataNodes in a cluster. Please refer to the next section for details on how to enable HA.
Enabling High Availability
          Note: Setting up HA is done after the Cloudera Installation is completed.
HDFS High Availability
The HDFS HA feature provides the option of running two NameNodes in the same cluster, in an Active/Passive configuration. These are referred to as the Active NameNode and the Standby NameNode. Unlike the Secondary NameNode, the Standby NameNode is a hot standby, allowing a fast failover to a new NameNode in the case that a machine crashes, or a graceful administrator-initiated failover for the purpose of planned maintenance. There cannot be more than two NameNodes.
For more information go to:
http://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cdh_hag_hdfs_ha_intro.html - topic_2_1
Setting Up HDFS HA
The Enable High Availability workflow leads through adding a second (standby) NameNode and configuring JournalNodes. During the workflow, Cloudera Manager creates a federated namespace.
1.    Log in to the admin node (rhel1) and create the Edit directory for the JournalNode
#clush -w rhel[1-3] mkdir -p /data/disk1/namenode-edits
#clush -w rhel[1-3] chmod 777 /data/disk1/namenode-edits
2.    Log in to the Cloudera manager and go to the HDFS service.
3.    In the top right corner Select Actions> Enable High Availability. A screen showing the hosts that are eligible to run a standby NameNode and the JournalNodes displays.
4.    Specify a name for the nameservice or accept the default name nameservice1 and click Continue.
5.    In the NameNode Hosts field, click Select a host. The host selection dialog displays.
6.    Check the checkbox next to the hosts (rhel2) where the standby NameNode is to be set up and click OK.
          Note: The standby NameNode cannot be on the same host as the active NameNode, and the host that is chosen should have the same hardware configuration (RAM, disk space, number of cores, and so on) as the active NameNode.
7.    In the JournalNode Hosts field, click Select hosts. The host selection dialog displays.
8.    Check the checkboxes next to an odd number of hosts (a minimum of three) to act as JournalNodes and click OK. Here we are using the same nodes as Zookeeper nodes.
          Note: JournalNodes should be hosted on hosts with similar hardware specification as the NameNodes. It is recommended that each JournalNode is put on the same hosts as the active and standby NameNodes, and the third JournalNode on ResourceManager node.
9.    Click Continue.
10.  In the JournalNode Edits Directory property, enter a directory location created earlier in step 1 for the JournalNode edits directory into the fields for each JournalNode host.
          Note: The directories specified should be empty, and must have the appropriate permissions.
Extra Options: Decide whether Cloudera Manager should clear existing data in ZooKeeper, Standby NameNode, and JournalNodes. If the directories are not empty (for example, re-enabling a previous HA configuration), Cloudera Manager will not automatically delete the contentsâselect to delete the contents by keeping the default checkbox selection. The recommended default is to clear the directories.
          Note: If you choose to not configure any of the extra options, the data should be in sync across the edits directories of the JournalNodes and should have the same version data as the NameNodes.
11.  Click Continue.
Cloudera Manager executes a set of commands that will stop the dependent services, delete, create, and configure roles and directories as appropriate, create a nameservice and failover controller, and restart the dependent services and deploy the new client configuration.
          Note: Formatting the name directory is expected to fail, if the directories are not empty.
12.  In the next screen additional steps are suggested by the Cloudera Manager to update the Hue and Hive metastore. Click Finish for the screen shown above.
          Note: The following subsections cover configuring Hue and Hive for HA as needed.
13.  In the Cloudera Manager, Click Home > HDFS > Instances to see Namenode in High Availability.

YARN High Availability
The YARN Resource Manager (RM) is responsible for tracking the resources in a cluster and scheduling applications (for example, MapReduce jobs). Before CDH 5, the RM was a single point of failure in a YARN cluster. The RM high availability (HA) feature adds redundancy in the form of an Active/Standby RM pair to remove this single point of failure. Furthermore, upon failover from the Standby RM to the Active, the applications can resume from their last check-pointed state; for example, completed map tasks in a MapReduce job are not re-run on a subsequent attempt. This allows events such the following to be handled without any significant performance effect on running applications.
Â·         Unplanned events such as machine crashes.
Â·         Planned maintenance events such as software or hardware upgrades on the machine running the ResourceManager

Setting up YARN HA
To set up YARN HA, complete the following steps:
1.    Log in to the Cloudera manager and go to the YARN service.
2.    Select Actions> Enable High Availability.
A screen showing the hosts that are eligible to run a standby ResourceManager displays.
The host where the current ResourceManager is running is not available as a choice.
3.    Select the host (rhel3) where the standby ResourceManager is to be installed, and click Continue.
Cloudera Manager proceeds to execute a set of commands that stop the YARN service, add a standby ResourceManager, initialize the ResourceManager high availability state in ZooKeeper, restart YARN, and redeploy the relevant client configurations.
4.    Click Finish once the installation is completed successfully.

Configuring Spark
The two main resources that Spark (and YARN) are dependent on are CPU and memory. Disk and network I/O, of course, play a part in Spark performance as well, but neither Spark nor YARN currently can actively manage them. Every Spark executor in any application has the same fixed number of cores and same fixed heap size. The number of cores can be specified with the executor-cores flag when invoking spark-submit, spark-shell, and pyspark from the command line, or by setting the spark.executor.cores property in the spark-defaults.conf file or in the SparkConf object.
And the heap size can be controlled with the executor-memory flag or the spark.executor.memory property. The cores property controls the number of concurrent tasks an executor can run, executor-cores = 5 mean that each executor can run a maximum of five tasks at the same time. The memory property impacts the amount of data Spark can cache, as well as the maximum sizes of the shuffle data structures used for grouping, aggregations, and joins.
The num-executors command-line flag or spark.executor.instances configuration property control the number of executors requested. Dynamic Allocation can be enabled from CDH5.4 instead setting the spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled to true. Dynamic allocation enables a Spark application to request executors when there is a backlog of pending tasks and free up executors when idle.
Asking for five executor cores will result in a request to YARN for five virtual cores. The memory requested from YARN is a little more complex for a couple reasons:
Â·         executor-memory/spark.executor.memory controls the executor heap size, but JVMs can also use some memory off heap, for example for VM overhead, interned Strings and direct byte buffers. The value of the spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverhead property is added to the executor memory to determine the full memory request to YARN for each executor. It defaults to max (384, 0.10 * spark.executor.memory).
Â·         YARN may round the requested memory up a little. YARNâs yarn.scheduler.minimum-allocation-mb and yarn.scheduler.increment-allocation-mb properties control the minimum and increment request values respectively.
Â·         The application master is a non-executor container with the special capability of requesting containers from YARN, takes up resources of its own that must be budgeted in. In yarn-client mode, it defaults to a 1024MB and one vcore. In yarn-cluster mode, the application master runs the driver, so itâs often useful to add its resources with the âdriver-memory and âdriver-cores properties.
Â·         Running executors with too much memory often results in excessive garbage collection delays. 64GB is a rough guess at a good upper limit for a single executor.
Â·         A good estimate is that at most five tasks per executor can achieve full write throughput, so itâs good to keep the number of cores per executor around that number.
Â·         Running tiny executors (with a single core and just enough memory needed to run a single task, for example) throws away the benefits that come from running multiple tasks in a single JVM. For example, broadcast variables need to be replicated once on each executor, so many small executors will result in many more copies of the data.
Tuning Resource Allocation for Spark
Below is an example of configuring a Spark application to use as much of the cluster as possible, we are using an example cluster with 16 nodes running NodeManagers, each equipped with 56 cores and 256GB of memory. yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb and yarn.nodemanager. resource.cpu-vcores should be set to 180 * 1024 = 184320 (megabytes) and 48 respectively.
spark.executor.instances/num-executors = 63
spark.executor.cores/--executor-cores = 5
spark.executor.memory/--executor-memory = 41G
This configuration results in four executors on all nodes except for the one with the AM, which will have three executors.
executor-memory is derived as (180/4 executors per node) = 45; 45 * 0.10 = 4.5 45 â 4.5 ~ 40.
For taking care of long running processes use 2G for the spark driver
spark.driver.memory = 2G
Submitting a Job
--driver -memory 2G âexecutor -memory 40G --num-executors 63 --executor-cores 5 --properties-file /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/etc/spark/conf.dist/spark-defaults.conf
In yarn-cluster mode, the local directories used by the Spark executors and the Spark driver will be the local directories configured for YARN (Hadoop YARN config yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs). If the user specifies spark.local.dir, it will be ignored.
In yarn-client mode, the Spark executors will use the local directories configured for YARN while the Spark driver will use those defined in spark.local.dir. The Spark driver does not run on the YARN cluster in yarn-client mode, only the Spark executors do.
spark.local.dir /tmp (Directory to use for "scratch" space in Spark, including map output files and RDDs that get stored on disk. This should be on a fast, local disk in your system).
Every Spark stage has a number of tasks, each of which processes data sequentially. In tuning Spark jobs, this parallelism number is the most important parameter in determining performance. The number of tasks in a stage is the same as the number of partitions in the last RDD in the stage. The number of partitions in an RDD is the same as the number of partitions in the RDD on which it depends, with a couple exceptions: the coalesce transformation allows creating an RDD with fewer partitions than its parent RDD, the union transformation creates an RDD with the sum of its parentsâ number of partitions, and Cartesian creates an RDD with their product.
RDDs produced by a file have their partitions determined by the underlying MapReduce InputFormat thatâs used. Typically there will be a partition for each HDFS block being read. Partitions for RDDs produced by parallelize come from the parameter given by the user, or spark.default.parallelism if none is given.
The primary concern is that the number of tasks will be too small. If there are fewer tasks than slots available to run them in, the stage wonât be taking advantage of all the CPU available.
If the stage in question is reading from Hadoop, your options are:
Â·         Use the repartition transformation, which will trigger a shuffle.
Â·         Configure your InputFormat to create more splits.
Â·         Write the input data out to HDFS with a smaller block size.
If the stage is getting its input from another stage, the transformation that triggered the stage boundary will accept a numPartitions argument.
The most straightforward way to tune the number of partitions is experimentation: Look at the number of partitions in the parent RDD and then keep multiplying that by 1.5 until performance stops improving.
In contrast with MapReduce for Spark when in doubt, it is almost always better to be on the side of a larger number of tasks (and thus partitions).
Shuffle Performance Improvement
spark.shuffle.compress true (compress map output files)
spark.broadcast.compress true(compress broadcast variables before sending them)
spark.io.compression.codec org.apache.spark.io.SnappyCompressionCodec (codec used to compress internal data such as RDD partitions, broadcast variables and shuffle outputs)
spark.shuffle.spill.compress true (Whether to compress data spilled during shuffles.)
spark.shuffle.io.numConnectionsPerPeer 4 (Connections between hosts are reused in order to reduce connection buildup for large clusters. For clusters with many hard disks and few hosts, this may result in insufficient concurrency to saturate all disks, and so users may consider increasing this value.)
spark.shuffle.file.buffer 64K (Size of the in-memory buffer for each shuffle file output stream. These buffers reduce the number of disk seeks and system calls made in creating intermediate shuffle file)
Improving Serialization Performance
Serialization plays an important role in the performance of any distributed application. Often, this will be the first thing that should be tuned to optimize a Spark application.
spark.serializer org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer (when speed is necessary)
spark.kryo.referenceTracking false
spark.kryoserializer.buffer 2000 (If the objects are large, may need to increase the size further to fit the size of the object being deserialized).
SparkSQL is ideally suited for mixed procedure jobs where SQL code is combined with Scala, Java, or Python programs. In general the SparkSQL command line interface is used for single user operations and ad hoc queries.
For multi-user SparkSQL environments, it is recommended to use a Thrift server connected via JDBC.
Spark SQL Tuning
Below are some guidelines for Spark SQL tuning:
1.    To compile each query to Java bytecode on the fly, turn on sql.codegen. This can improve performance for large queries, but can slow down very short queries.
spark.sql.codegen true
spark.sql.unsafe.enabled true
2.    Configuration of in-memory caching can be done using the setConf method on SQLContext or by running SET key=value commands using SQL.
3.    spark.sql.inMemoryColumnarStorage.compressed true (will automatically select a compression codec for each column based on statistics of the data)
4.    spark.sql.inMemoryColumnarStorage.batchSize 5000 (Controls the size of batches for columnar caching. Larger batch sizes can improve memory utilization and compression, but risk OOMs when caching data)
5.    The columnar nature of the ORC format helps avoid reading unnecessary columns, but it is still possible to read unnecessary rows. ORC avoids this type of overhead by using predicate push-down with three levels of built-in indexes within each file: file level, stripe level, and row level. This combination of indexed data and columnar storage reduces disk I/O significantly, especially for larger datasets where I/O bandwidth becomes the main bottleneck for performance.
6.    By default, ORC predicate push-down is disabled in Spark SQL. To obtain performance benefits from predicate push-down, enable it explicitly, as follows:
7.    spark.sql.orc.filterPushdown=true
8.    In SparkSQL to automatically determine the number of reducers for joins and groupbys, use the parameter,
9.    spark.sql.shuffle.partitions 200, (default value is 200)
This property can be put into hive-site.xml to override the default value.
10.  Set log to WARN in log4j.properties to reduce log level.
          Note: Running Thrift server and connecting to spark-sql through beeline is the recommended option for multi-session testing.
Compression for Hive
Set the following Hive parameters to compress the Hive output files using Snappy compression:
hive.exec.compress.output=true
hive.exec.orc.default.compress=SNAPPY
Changing the Log Directory for All Applications
To change the default log from the /var prefix to /data/disk1, complete the following steps:
1.    Log into the cloudera home page and click My Clusters.
2.    From the configuration drop-down list select âAll Log Directories.â
3.    Click Save changes.

Cloudera Data Science Workbench uses subdomains to provide isolation for user-generated HTML and JavaScript, and routing requests between services. To set up subdomains for Cloudera Data Science Workbench, configure your DNS server with an A record for a wildcard DNS name such as *.cdsw.<your_domain>.com for the master host, and a second A record for the root entry of cdsw.<your_domain>.com.
[root@cdsw ~]# cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
10.13.1.50 rhel1
10.13.1.51 rhel2
10.13.1.52 rhel3
10.13.1.53 rhel4
10.13.1.54 rhel5
10.13.1.55 rhel6
10.13.1.56 rhel7
10.13.1.57 rhel8
   â¦
10.13.1.73 rhel24
  10.13.1.250 cdsw1.cisco.com
10.13.1.251 cdsw2.cisco.com
10.13.1.252 cdsw3.cisco.com
10.13.1.253 cdsw4.cisco.com
  You can also use a wildcard CNAME record if it is supported by your DNS provider.
          This Wildcard DNS subdomain need to be used by the jump host/edge node or the bastion server as well.
With dnsmasq, to add a wildcard DNS subdomain, do the following for just the master host.
Update /etc/dnsmasq.conf to enable Wildcard entry
address=/cdsw/10.13.1.250
#service dnsmasq restart
Test the working of wildcard DNS with dig or nslookup
#nslookup *.cdsw.<your domain>.com
#dig cdsw.<your_domain>.com
#dig *.cdsw.<your domain>.com

Supported JDK Version
The entire CDH cluster, including Cloudera Data Science Workbench gateway nodes, must use Oracle JDK. OpenJDK is not supported by CDH, Cloudera Manager, or Cloudera Data Science Workbench.
Spark 2.2 which is needed by CDSW to run Spark jobs (on Hadoop nodes) requires JDK 1.8. On CSD-based deployments, Cloudera Manager automatically detects the path and version of Java installed on Cloudera Data Science Workbench gateway hosts.
To upgrade your entire CDH cluster to JDK 1.8, see Upgrading to Oracle JDK 1.8.
          For more details https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/release-notes/topics/rn_consolidated_pcm.html#pcm_jdk
IP Tables and Security on CDSW Nodes
Disable all pre-existing iptables rules. While Kubernetes makes extensive use of iptables, it is difficult to predict how pre-existing iptables rules will interact with the rules inserted by Kubernetes. Therefore, Cloudera recommends you use the following commands to disable all pre-existing rules before you proceed with the installation.
yum -y install iptables-service
yum install initscripts
systemctl stop firewalld
systemctl mask firewalld
systemctl disable firewalld
systemctl enable iptables
systemctl start iptables
iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -F
iptables -t mangle -F
iptables -F
iptables -X
service iptables save

sestatus
Configure Block Devices
Docker Block Device
The Cloudera Data Science Workbench installer will format and mount Docker on each gateway host. Make sure there is no important data stored on these devices. Do not mount these block devices prior to installation.
Application Block Device or Mount Point
The master host on Cloudera Data Science Workbench requires at least 500 GB for database and project storage. This recommended capacity is contingent on the expected number of users and projects on the cluster. While large data files should be stored on HDFS, it is not uncommon to find gigabytes of data or libraries in individual projects. Running out of storage will cause the application to fail. Make sure you continue to carefully monitor disk space usage and I/O using Cloudera Manager.
          Note: To enable data resilience, enable this drive as RAID1 of SSDs (using commands as shown in configuring namenode).
Cloudera Data Science Workbench will store all application data at /var/lib/cdsw. In a CSD-based deployment, this location is not configurable. Cloudera Data Science Workbench will assume the system administrator has formatted and mounted one or more block devices to /var/lib/cdsw.
Regardless of the application data storage configuration you choose, /var/lib/cdsw must be stored on a separate block device (the RAID1 of SSDs created for this).

          Note: CDSW need Spark 2 to deploy Spark Jobs.
Add the Cloudera Data Science Workbench Service
To install CDSW, complete the following steps:
          For more information, refer to: https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/data-science-workbench/latest/topics/cdsw_install_parcel.html.
1.    Log into the Cloudera Manager Admin Console.
2.    On the Home > Status tab, right-click the cluster name and select Add a Service to launch the wizard. A list of services will be displayed.
3.    Select the Cloudera Data Science Workbench service and click Continue.
4.    Assign the Master and Worker roles to the gateway hosts. You must assign the Cloudera Data Science Workbench Master role to one gateway host, and optionally, assign the Worker role to one or more gateway hosts.
          Note: Do not assign Masters and Workers to the same host; even on single node deployments, the Master can perform the functions of a Worker as needed.
5.    Configure the following parameters and click Continue
          Note: For more information about the parameters, refer to: https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/data-science-workbench/latest/topics/cdsw_install_parcel.html.
  6.    The wizard will now begin a First Run of the Cloudera Data Science Workbench service. This includes deploying client configuration for HDFS, YARN and Spark 2, installing the package dependencies on all hosts, and formatting the Docker block device. The wizard will also assign the Application role to the host running Master, and the Docker Daemon role to all the Cloudera Data Science Workbench gateway hosts.
7.    Once the First Run command has completed successfully, click Finish to go back to the Cloudera Manager home page.
          Note: CDSW will take 10-15 minutes to come online for the first time; they can follow the Docker/Master/Application process logs to track progress.
Create the Administrator Account
After your installation is complete, set up the initial administrator account. Go to the Cloudera Data Science Workbench web application at http://cdsw.<your_domain>.com.
You must access Cloudera Data Science Workbench from the Cloudera Data Science Workbench Domain configured when setting up the service, and not the hostname of the master node. Visiting the hostname of the master node will result in a 404 error.
The first account that you create becomes the site administrator. You may now use this account to create a new project and start using the workbench to run data science workloads.
Non-Kerberized Clusters
          Note: In this CVD, we did not enable Kerberos.
            Note: To enable Kerberos, refer to: https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/data-science-workbench/latest/topics/cdsw_kerberos.html.
1.    To disable Kerberos, delete the file /etc/krb5.conf on the CDSW nodes.
2.    For a non-kerberized cluster, by default, your Hadoop username will be set to your Cloudera Data Science Workbench login username. Override this default and set an alternative HADOOP_USER_NAME (âadminâ in this case which was the admin user created) .
3.    Create User admin in hdfs.
hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/admin
hdfs dfs -chwon admin:admin /user/admin
4.    Go to the Hadoop Username Override setting at Account settings > Hadoop Authentication.
5.    Restart CDSW from Cloudera Manager.
Using GPUs for Cloudera Data Science Workbench Workloads
A GPU is a specialized processor that can be used to accelerate highly parallelized computationally-intensive workloads. Because of their computational power, GPUs have been found to be particularly well-suited to deep learning workloads. Ideally, CPUs and GPUs should be used in tandem for data engineering and data science workloads. A typical machine learning workflow involves data preparation, model training, model scoring, and model fitting. You can use existing general-purpose CPUs for each stage of the workflow, and optionally accelerate the math-intensive steps with the selective application of special-purpose GPUs. For example, GPUs allow you to accelerate model fitting using frameworks such as Tensorflow, PyTorch, Keras, MXNet, and Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK).
By enabling GPU support, data scientists can share GPU resources available on Cloudera Data Science Workbench nodes. Users can requests a specific number of GPU instances, up to the total number available on a node, which are then allocated to the running session or job for the duration of the run. Projects can use isolated versions of libraries, and even different CUDA and cuDNN versions via Cloudera Data Science Workbench's extensible engine feature.
          Note: For more information, refer to: https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/data-science-workbench/latest/topics/cdsw_gpu.html.
Enabling GPU with CDSW
Â·         Cloudera Data Science Workbench only supports CUDA-enabled NVIDIA GPU cards.
Â·         Cloudera Data Science Workbench does not support heterogeneous GPU hardware in a single deployment.
Â·         Cloudera Data Science Workbench does not include an engine image that supports NVIDIA libraries. 
This section provides instructions about creating your own custom CUDA-capable engine image.
To enable Docker containers to use the GPUs, the previously installed NVIDIA driver libraries must be consolidated in a single directory named after the <driver_version>, and mounted into the containers. This is done using the nvidia-docker package, which is a thin wrapper around the Docker CLI and a Docker plugin.
The following sample steps demonstrate how to use nvidia-docker to set up the directory structure for the drivers so that they can be easily consumed by the Docker containers that will leverage the GPU. Perform these steps on all nodes with GPU hardware installed.
1.    Download and install nvidia-docker.
wget https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/releases/download/v1.0.1/nvidia-docker-1.0.1-1.x86_64.rpm
yum install nvidia-docker-1.0.1-1.x86_64.rpm
          Note: This example uses nvidia-docker 1.0.
  2.    Start the necessary services and plugins:
systemctl start nvidia-docker
systemctl enable nvidia-docker
3.    Run a small container to create the Docker volume structure
nvidia-docker run --rm nvidia/cuda  nvidia-smi
4.    Verify that the /var/lib/nvidia-docker/volumes/nvidia_driver/$NVIDIA_DRIVER_VERSION/ directory was created.
5.    Use the following Docker command to verify that Cloudera Data Science Workbench can access the GPU:
docker run --net host \
    --device=/dev/nvidiactl \
    --device=/dev/nvidia-uvm \
    --device=/dev/nvidia0 \
    -v /var/lib/nvidia-docker/volumes/nvidia_driver/$NVIDIA_DRIVER_VERSION/:/usr/local/nvidia/ \
    -it nvidia/cuda \
    /usr/local/nvidia/bin/nvidia-smi
          Note: On a multi-GPU machine the output of this command will show exactly one GPU. This is because we have run this sample Docker container with only one device (/dev/nvidia0).
6.    Restart CDSW.
Enable GPU Support in Cloudera Data Science Workbench
To enable Cloudera Data Science Workbench to identify the GPUs installed, complete the following steps:
1.    In Cloudera Manager â Cloudera Data Science Workbench Configuration, set the following properties:
Â·         Enable GPU Support
Â·         Complete path to the NVIDIA driver libraries "/var/lib/nvidia-docker/volumes/nvidia_driver/$NVIDIA_DRIVER_VERSION/"
  2.    Restart CDSW from Cloudera Manager for GPU to display in Cloudera Data Science Workbench:
  Create a Custom CUDA-Capable Engine Image
The base engine image (docker.repository.cloudera.com/cdsw/engine:4) that ships with Cloudera Data Science Workbench will need to be extended with CUDA libraries to make it possible to use GPUs in jobs and sessions.
          For more information, refer to https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/data-science-workbench/latest/topics/cdsw_gpu.html.
For this we first create a local registry
Run a Local Registry
To start the registry container, run the following command:
$ docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry:2
          For more information about creating a local docker registry, refer to: https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/#copy-an-image-from-docker-hub-to-your-registry
The following sample Dockerfile illustrates an engine on top of which machine learning frameworks such as Tensorflow and PyTorch can be used. This Dockerfile uses a deep learning library from NVIDIA called NVIDIA CUDA Deep Neural Network (cuDNN). Make sure you check with the machine learning framework that you intend to use in order to know which version of cuDNN is needed. As an example, Tensorflow 1.4 uses CUDA 8.0 and requires cuDNN 6.0.
To create the cuda.Dockerfile, run the following command:
FROM  docker.repository.cloudera.com/cdsw/engine:4
  RUN NVIDIA_GPGKEY_SUM=d1be581509378368edeec8c1eb2958702feedf3bc3d17011adbf24efacce4ab5 && \

            libcudnn6=$CUDNN_VERSION-1+cuda8.0 && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
  Build the custom engine image out of cuda.Dockerfile using the following command:
#docker build --network host -t localhost/cisco-gpu-demo:2 . -f cuda.Dockerfile
# docker images
  Tag the image as localhost:5000/<image name>. This creates an additional tag for the existing image. When the first part of the tag is a hostname and port, Docker interprets this as the location of a registry, when pushing.
 [root@cdsw1 CUDA]# docker tag localhost/cisco-gpu-demo:2 localhost:5000/cisco-gpu-demo
Push the image to the local registry running at localhost:5000:
$ docker push localhost:5000/cisco-gpu-demo
Allocate GPUs for Sessions and Jobs
Once Cloudera Data Science Workbench has been enabled to use GPUs, a site administrator must whitelist the CUDA-capable engine image created in the previous step. Site administrators can also set a limit on the maximum number of GPUs that can be allocated per session or job.
1.    Sign in to Cloudera Data Science Workbench as a site administrator.
2.    Click Admin.
3.    Go to the Engines tab.
4.    From the Maximum GPUs per Session/Job drop-down list, select the maximum number of GPUs that can be used by an engine.
5.    Under Engine Images, add the custom CUDA-capable engine image created in the previous step. This whitelists the image and allows project administrators to use the engine in their jobs and sessions.
6.    Click Update.
Project administrators can now whitelist the CUDA engine image to make it available for sessions and jobs within a particular project by completing the following steps:
1.    Go to Projects Overview
2.    Click on any projects and choose Settings
3.    Go to the Engines tab in the above page
4.    Under Engine Image, add the CUDA-capable engine image.
