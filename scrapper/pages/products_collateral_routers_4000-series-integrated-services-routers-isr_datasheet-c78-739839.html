2- and 4-Port ISDN BRI S/T
Network Interface Modules Data Sheet
Product overview
The Cisco® 4000 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISRs) offer a wide variety of WAN connectivity modules to accommodate the range of application needs in customer networks. The Cisco 2- and 4-Port ISDN BRI S/T Network Interface Modules (NIMs) offer investment protection by providing data connectivity to legacy ISDN networks for the 4000 Series ISRs (Figure 1).
Figure 1.      Cisco 4-Port ISDN BRI S/T NIM
Integration
The 2- and 4-port ISDN BRI NIMs enable branches to use legacy ISDN Basic Rate Interface (BRI) networks for data connections. Because they support industry-standard ISDN dialup capabilities, these modules can be deployed as the main WAN connection over ISDN BRI, dial backup over ISDN BRI, or a combination of the two. Each physical interface supports data traffic over two 64-kbps B channels, which can be automatically bundled together using Multi-Link Point-to-Point Protocol (MLPPP).
Investment protection
The 2- and 4-port ISDN BRI NIMs provide a cost-effective ISDN Dial-on-Demand Routing (DDR) solution for use with legacy ISDN networks. These NIMs are supported on the Cisco 4000 Series ISRs and uphold Cisco's commitment to providing customers with maximum flexibility and investment protection.
Because the same cards can be used on all Cisco 4000 Series ISRs, the number of stocking units can be reduced and the NIMs can be redeployed from one platform to another.
Shared features with Cisco ISR G2 Series ISDN modules
The Cisco 2- and 4-port ISDN BRI NIMs offer many of the same features as the ISR G2 Series ISDN BRI modules and can thus be smoothly deployed without any additional training (Table 1).
A new feature is full online insertion and removal (OIR or hot swap), which was introduced with the 4000 Series NIMs.

*1 - Dialer string is configured under Dialer Interface on NIM-2BRI-S/T and NIM-4BRI-S/T.
*2 - Bridge is replaced with BDI in Cisco IOS XE. At the time of this writing, the ISDN port is not supported.
CLI comparison to Cisco ISR G2 Series for configuring ISDN modules
There is no noticeable difference in the ISDN command-line interface between Cisco IOS® XE and Cisco IOS M&T (Cisco IOS Classic).
