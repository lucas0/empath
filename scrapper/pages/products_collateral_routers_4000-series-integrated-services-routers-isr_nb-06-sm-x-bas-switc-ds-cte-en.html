Power over Ethernet (PoE) Support
PoE removes the need for wall power to each PoE-enabled device and eliminates the cost for additional electrical cabling and circuits that would otherwise be necessary in IP phone and wireless LAN (WLAN) deployments thereby providing a lower TCO for deployments that incorporate these devices or any IEEE 802.3af-compliant end device in general. The power requirements of endpoints vary based on their application, complexity, and function. For instance, basic IP phones might draw approximately 6W of power, whereas contemporary LED lighting fixtures can draw up to 50W for routine operation
The SM-X EtherSwitch modules can support POE, POE+ and UPOE on any of the RJ45 copper ports (16xGiG + 4xmGiG or 40xGiG + 8xmGiG). All 22 or 48 copper ports support Power over Ethernet (PoE) - 15.4 W and PoE+ up to 30W. The same ports support standardized 802.3af (15.4W) and 802.3at (25.5W). Up to 8 Copper Ethernet Interfaces provide UPOE (60W) support per module. The table below lists the possible PoE and Power Supply combinations
Table 3 gives information about total PoE power output. Depending on the Cisco 4400, 4300, platform models, the available PoE power ranges from 250 to 1000 watts. Power over Ethernet requires the PoE versions of the router power supplies. The ISR4400, ISR4300 series routers support multiple PoE powering modes:
●      Normal: One PoE power supply.
●      Redundant: Two PoE internal power supplies (ISR4451-X and ISR4461 Series) where one is active and one is standby.
●      Boost: Two PoE internal power supplies (ISR4451-X and ISR4461 Series), where both are actively supplying PoE power; redundancy will not be supported in this mode because both power supplies are in active use simultaneously.

        Additional PoE features include the following:
●      Per-port power consumption control allows you to specify a maximum power setting on an individual port.
●      The Cisco PoE MIBs provide proactive visibility into power usage and allow you to set different power-level thresholds.
●      Cisco Discovery Protocol Version 2 allows the Cisco SM-X EtherSwitch Service Modules to negotiate a more granular power setting than IEEE classification provides when connecting to a Cisco powered device such as IP phones or access points.
●      The Link Layer Discovery Protocol Media Endpoint Discovery (LLDP-MED) link layer discovery protocol and MIB enable interoperability in multivendor networks. Switches exchange speed, duplex, and power settings with end devices such as IP phones.
Security Feature Support on SM-X EtherSwitch module
The Cisco SM-X EtherSwitch module supports a variety of security features. The following features are supported by the product at launch
Support for 802.1X:
IEEE 802.1X port-based authentication is configured on a device to prevent unauthorized devices (supplicants) from gaining access to the network. By installing the switch module on the router, the unit can combine the function of a router and switch, depending on the configuration and chosen options. The Cisco SM-X EtherSwitch module supports 802.1X configuration on all copper ports. The same ports support Multi-Domain Authentication (MDA) Guest VLAN and MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB).
Support for MACSec:
MACsec is the IEEE 802.1AE standard for authenticating and encrypting packets between two MACsec-capable devices. The SM-X EtherSwitch module supports 128-bit (gcm-aes-128) LAN MACSec on the copper ports[3]. In addition to MACSec, the ports support 802.1AE encryption MACSec Key Agreement (MKA) on downlink ports for encryption between the switch and host device. The MKA Protocol provides the required session keys and manages the required encryption keys.
Port Security:
Port security is used to restrict input to an interface by limiting and identifying mac addresses of the stations allowed to access the port. When specific MAC addresses are assigned to a secure port, the port does not forward packets with source addresses outside the group of defined addresses. If the number of secure MAC addresses is limited to a single secure MAC address, the workstation attached to that port is assured the full bandwidth of the port.
Table 4.        Security features supported on SM-X EtherSwitch Module
Feature
Benefit
IEEE 802.1x
●  IEEE 802.1x allows dynamic, port-based security, providing user authentication.
●  IEEE 802.1x with voice VLAN permits an IP phone to access the voice VLAN irrespective of the authorized or unauthorized state of the port.
●  IEEE 802.1x and port security are provided to authenticate the port and manage network access for all MAC addresses, including that of the client.
●  IEEE 802.1x with an ACL assignment allows for specific identity-based security policies regardless of where the user is connected.
●  IEEE 802.1x with guest VLAN allows guests without 802.1x clients to have limited network access on the guest VLAN.
MACsec
●  Exceptional security with integrated hardware support for MACsec is defined in IEEE 802.1AE. MACsec provides MAC layer encryption over wired networks using out-of-band methods for encryption keying.
●  The MACsec Key Agreement (MKA) Protocol provides the required session keys and manages the keys required for encryption when configured. MKA and MACsec are implemented following successful authentication using the 802.1x Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) framework.
●  In Cisco Enhanced EtherSwitch Service Modules, both the user and down-link ports (links between the switch and endpoint devices such as a PC or IP phone) as well as the network and up-link ports can be secured using MACsec.
●  With MACsec you can encrypt switch-to-switch links such as access to distribution, or encrypt dark fiber links within a building or between buildings.
Multidomain authentication
●  Multidomain authentication allows an IP phone and a PC to authenticate on the same switch port while placing them on the appropriate voice and data VLAN.
MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB)
●  MAB for voice allows third-party IP phones without an 802.1x supplicant to get authenticated using the MAC address.
Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN and RSPAN)
●  Bidirectional data support on the SPAN port allows the any Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to take action when an intruder is detected.
Centralized authentication
●  TACACS+ and RADIUS authentication facilitates centralized control of the switch and restricts unauthorized users from altering the configuration.
MAC address authentication
●  MAC address notification allows administrators to be notified of users added to or removed from the network.
Port security
●  Port security secures the access to an access or trunk port based on MAC address.
Product summary
In summary, the Cisco SM-X Layer2 EtherSwitch Service Modules enable a higher level of control and security through the support of per port 802.1x and MACSec capabilities. Cisco SM-X EtherSwitch Service Modules also offer enhanced PoE power levels with the introduction of IEEE 802.3at PoE+, broadening the span of network equipment powered from the switch. By minimizing Operating Expenses (OpEx) without sacrificing any advanced switching features, Cisco SM-X EtherSwitch Service Modules can help you maximize your Return On Investment (ROI) for the network infrastructure and accelerate the deployment of productivity-enhancing services to your enterprise branch offices or small to midsize business offices.
