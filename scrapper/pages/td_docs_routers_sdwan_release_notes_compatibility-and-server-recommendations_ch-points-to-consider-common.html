Note
We perform scale testing with server configuration detailed in this document. You must deploy servers that fulfil the technical parameters requirements which are specified in this document. You can choose to use servers from third party vendors, which are technically equivalent to the specifications detailed in this document. However, third party servers are not qualified by Cisco. In the event of any issue, Cisco TAC can triage but Cisco will not take liability for issues arising from hardware belonging to a third party vendor.
Cisco vManage Single Tenant
The system that you select to run Cisco vManage must satisfy the storage throughput requirement to match the above performance results.
We recommend that you use Raid 0 for best performance, since application redundancy is built into the solution
An oversubscription of 2:1 on vCPU to pCPU (physical CPU) can be supported on Cisco vManage when the overlay has fewer than 250 devices.
An oversubscription of 2:1 on vCPU to pCPU (physical CPU) is supported for vSmart and vBond in all of the above deployments.
We recommend that you use a 10-Gbps interface for production.
For 3-node and 6-node clusters, we recommend that you use three network interfaces â€”one for tunnel, one for management, and one for the Cisco vManage cluster communication.
Co-hosting of Cisco vManage instances on single server is not supported. However, Cisco vManage can be co-hosted with vSmart and vBond instances on same server.
If SAIE is enabled:
Beyond 50 GB per day up to 100 GB per day, the configuration needs a 3-node cluster. For more that 100 GB per day, configure a 6-node cluster (all sizes are per-day sizes).
If SAIE is disabled
Depending on network sensitivity and deployment type, we recommend using a cluster of three Cisco vManage instances if you want to configure intra-cluster high availability.

Note
The use of encrypted hard drives is not supported for on-premises deployments of Cisco SD-WAN due to the potential impact on software performance.
Starting from Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1, DPI and Aggregated DPI are called as SAIE and Aggregated SAIE respectively.
Starting from Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, you can disable Aggregated DPI statistics collection, in Cisco vManage select Administration > Settings > Statistics Setting . Click Edit. Scroll to find Aggregated DPI and choose Disable All.
To disable DPI statistics collection, in Cisco vManage select Administration > Settings > Statistics Setting . Click Edit. Scroll to find DPI and choose Disable All.
Cisco vBond Orchestrator Single Tenant
The OS volume must be on a solid-state drive (SSD).
The maximum number of DTLS session supported is 4000 per Cisco vBond Controller.
Cisco vSmart Controller Single Tenant
The OS volume must be on a solid-state drive (SSD).
For information about latency requirements, see vManage Cluster Creation and Troubleshooting White Paper.
