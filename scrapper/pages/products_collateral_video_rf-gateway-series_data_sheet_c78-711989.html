Product Overview
The Cisco® RF Gateway Downstream 384 (RFGW-DS384) line card is an 8-port, 384-channel universal edge quadrature amplitude modulation (U-EQAM) modulator designed for operation in the Cisco RF Gateway 10 platform. The Cisco RF Gateway Downstream 384 Universal Edge QAM Line Card provides dramatically increased density and functionality as compared to the Cisco RF Gateway DS48-1G Universal Edge QAM Line Card.
The Cisco RFGW-DS384 offers concurrent support for standard and high-definition digital broadcast television, switched digital video (SDV), video-on-demand (VoD), and DOCSIS® modular cable modem termination system (M-CMTS) services. Cable operators can choose to configure the line card as DOCSIS only, video only, or DOCSIS and video shared universal edge QAM.
In the 10-slot Cisco RF Gateway 10 platform, the Cisco RFGW-DS384 line cards (Figure 1) can be configured with 1:N redundancy (up to 1:9), or 2:N redundancy (up to 2:8), resulting in a fully protected, high-capacity, and highly dense edge QAM solution. For video services, the line cards can accept multiple formats of video content and perform a wide array of video processing features. Leading-edge RF technology is used to perform QAM modulation and RF up-conversion at significant space and power savings compared to previous up-conversion architectures.

A minimum configuration of 64 counts of SWLIC-DS384 is required when purchasing Cisco RFGW-DS384 hardware.
Notes on Licenses
●   If purchasing multiple line cards, each line card in the order must have the same number of upstream and downstream licenses. Upgrade licenses may be purchased in case customers need line cards with different licenses.
●   eDelivery allows for electronic delivery of purchased license product activation key (PAK).
●   Partial fulfillment is supported. If customers wish to purchase upgrade licenses for multiple hardware devices (for example, if they wish to upgrade all their Cisco RFGW-DS384), partial fulfillment allows all upgrade licenses to be generated using a single PAK if the customer desires. This can greatly increase operational ease of license upgrades.
●   Return materials authorization (RMA): Cisco Services will replace faulty hardware with hardware that has no downstream or upstream licenses. Customers will need to transfer licenses from the failed board to the new board to make it operational.
