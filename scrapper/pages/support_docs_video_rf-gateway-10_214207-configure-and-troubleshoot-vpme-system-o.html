Troubleshoot VPME on RFGW-10
Introduction
This document describes the VoD Privacy Mode Encryption (VPME) system, how to configure it on RFGW-10, and steps to troubleshoot.
Prerequisites
Requirements
There are no specific requirements for this document.
Components Used
This document is not restricted to specific software and hardware versions.
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Background Information
The Cisco Converged EdgeQAM Manager (CEM), a.k.a. Cisco Encryption Manager or Converged Encryption Manager is a Java application that runs on Windows/Linux Systems. It communicates with the Encryption Renewal System (ERS) over the Internet and obtains the Entitlement Control Messages (ECMs), containing the Control Word to scramble the video, then forwards the ECM messages to Cisco Edge QAM devices in the site. The EQAM devices scramble the stream with the Control Word (CW) contained in the ECM, and send the scrambled content plus the ECM to the Set-Top Boxes (STBs):
New ECMs are sent periodically (order of days), depending on the level of security the SP wants to ensure. Until the ECM is renewed, the EQAMS keeps using the last one received.

Troubleshoot VPME on RFGW-10

Here you can see the problem with a VoD session that is trying to establish. For few seconds (before it drops) it is in ACTIVE state, with traffic in input bitrate but not encrypted. This behavior suggests an encryption problem.
You can further confirm this by putting an access list on the uplinks, in order to match the traffic with the loopback IPs, and verify that you see packets matches on the access list.
Step 2. Check the CEM status on the RFGW-10.
RFGW-10#show cable video scramble pme stat

Vodsid     : 500
CEM IP     : 10.11.12.13
CEM Port   : 5000
Local Port : 0
Count of ECMs recd   : 0
CEM Connection State : Not Connected 
CEM Connection will be attempted after 50 seconds
Note: the CEM IP is the IP of the VM, as the CEM is just a java application running on top of it.
How it must look like:
RFGW-10#show cable video scramble pme stat

Vodsid     : 500
CEM IP     : 10.11.12.13
CEM Port   : 5000
Local Port : 22268
Count of ECMs recd   : 1
CEM Connection State : Connected
Step 3. Check connectivity by pinging the CEM IP address.
Step 4. Check the CEM configuration.
You need GUI access to the VM in order to enter the CEM application's GUI. Once there, you need to verify the configuration of the interfaces to the RFGW-10 nodes and the ERS server, as explained in the CEM guide: Cisco Converged EdgeQAM Manager User Guide
If you have only CLI access to the VM, you can issue ps -ef to check whether the CEM application runs, and also check the logs with tail -f CEM.log
