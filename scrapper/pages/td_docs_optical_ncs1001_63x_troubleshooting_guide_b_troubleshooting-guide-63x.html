Alarm Troubleshooting
This chapter gives a description, severity, and troubleshooting procedure for each commonly encountered Cisco NCS 1001 alarm and condition. When an alarm is raised, refer to its clearing procedure.
0/PM [0|1] Unit Unsupported
Default Severity: Critical (CR), Service Affecting (SA)
Logical Object: EQUIPMENT
The 0/PM [0|1] Unit Unsupported alarm is raised when a an usupported PSU is plugged within NCS1001 chassis. The alarms has two forms because of the two PSU:
0/PM0 unit unsupported
0/PM1 unit unsupported
Clear the 0/PM [0|1] Unit Unsupported Alarm
Procedure
Replace the PSU with correct part number and hardware revision.
If the alarm does not clear, log into the Technical Support Website at http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html for more information or call Cisco TAC (1 800 553-2447).
0/RP0 Unit Unsupported
Default Severity: Critical (CR), Service Affecting (SA)
Logical Object: EQUIPMENT
The 0/RP0 Unit Unsupported alarm is raised when an unsupported CPU board is plugged in the chassis.
Clear the 0/RP0 Unit Unsupported Alarm
Procedure
Replace the control board with a proper part number and or hardware revision
If the alarm does not clear, log into the Technical Support Website at http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html for more information or call Cisco TAC (1 800 553-2447).
AMPLI-GAIN-LOW, AMPLI-GAIN-HIGH
Default Severity: Minor (MN), Non-Service-Affecting (NSA)
Logical Object: OTS
The Amplifier Gain Low or High alarm is raised when the EDFA module cannot reach the gain setpoint. This condition occurs if the amplifier reaches its range boundaries.
Clear the AMPLI-GAIN-LOW, AMPLI-GAIN-HIGH Alarm
Procedure
Step 1
If the Amplifier-control-mode is set to "Manual", the applied gain comes from configuration. You need to adjust the gain setting to a correct value (not too low or too high).
Step 2
If the Amplifier-Control-Mode is set to "Automatic" it may be due to a too long/too short span or other conditions (i.e. measured channels). Check the overall system settings and performance.
Step 3
If the alarm persist, it may indicate an amplifier hardware failure.
If the alarm does not clear, log into the Technical Support Website at http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html for more information or call Cisco TAC (1 800 553-2447).
AUTO-AMPLI-DISABLED
Default Severity: Minor (MN), Not-Service-Affecting (NSA)
Logical Object: OTS
The Amplifier Automatic Control Disabled alarm is raised when the amplifier is working in automatic mode and there is a channel disequalization. Hence the control algorithm cannot calculate proper gain.
Clear the AUTO-AMPLI-DISABLED Alarm
Procedure
Step 1
Check the OTS-OCH power levels in input and output of the amplifier.
Step 2
The minimum channel power value and maximum channel power value shall be outside the channel-power-max-delta.
Step 3
Review the channel plan at system level (channel launch power vs channel path) and increase the channel-power-max-delta.
If the alarm does not clear, log into the Technical Support Website at http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html for more information or call Cisco TAC (1 800 553-2447).
AUTO-AMPLI-CTRL-DISABLED
Default Severity: NotAlarmed (NA), Not-Service-Affecting (NSA)
Logical Object: OTS

Clear the AUTO-AMPLI-CTRL-DISABLED Alarm
Procedure
Step 1
(Option 1) Review the channel plan at system level.
One or more channels may have power problems compared to others.
Step 2
(Option 2) Check the OTS-OCH power levels in output of the amplifier.
The minimum channel power value and maximum channel power value shall be outside the channel-power-max-delta.
Step 3
Review the channel plan at system level (channel lauch power versus channel path) and increase the channel-power-max-delta.
If the alarm does not clear, log into the Technical Support Website at http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html for more information or call Cisco TAC (1 800 553-2447).
