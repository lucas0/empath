    Overview
Slow, labor-intensive visual identification and correlation of root cause is required to resolve cross-domain service impacts. That’s why operations teams miss opportunities to quickly detect and resolve service-impacting incidents despite an abundance of monitoring tools. From applications to the underlying network, compute, and storage, each domain is monitored separately as illustrated in Figure 2. Fault and performance management are often managed independently. Change management and customer support are usually not fully integrated within the process.
Vitria VIA AIOps for Cisco® Network Automation delivers automated analysis that enables rapid remediation of service-impacting events across all technology and application layers.
Figure 1.               
VIA AIOps operates through the entire event pipeline from observation to analysis and action to reduce the time to diagnose and resolve issues faster through automation
Interdependent systems and applications often make it difficult to discover and then fix the true cause with legacy fault management systems.
Figure 2.               
Legacy fault management systems with siloed monitoring systems
Vitria VIA AIOps for Cisco Network Automation handles fault, performance, and change management across service domains as depicted in Figure 3. Automated intelligent workflows enable rapid resolution of performance and customer-impacting events to deliver measurable service assurance improvement. The result is a reduction in the overall cost of addressing performance issues and improving the customer experience by accelerating the time to not only detect issues, but also resolve them.
To find the cause quickly, you need to see and react to the interplay across the service elements to distinguish between the cause and the symptoms and then fix it fast.

Increasing infrastructure complexity and scale
Digitization demands that service delivery infrastructure be scalable and extensible to support growing numbers of applications, services, and subscribers. From an operational perspective, the systems need to effectively deal with technology layers, domains, a large number and variety of devices, data volumes, and disparate data formats while delivering a simplified experience to improve operational efficiency. Virtualization adds complexity by decoupling the software from the underlying hardware and dynamic workload-based scaling. Microservices adds additional complexity by decomposing applications into discrete services. The velocity of application changes and the endless number of potential endpoints exacerbate service assurance challenges.
Traditional fault management systems rely upon siloed monitoring tools. Each monitoring system generates volumes of alarms. Interrelated issues across systems result in multiple tickets being opened and separate teams taking actions that may not be addressing the true root cause, wasting time and resources. While this traditional fault management process plays out, customer frustration climbs.
To reduce the time to detect issues, accelerate resolution, and reduce cost, signals across the operating environment from the IT elements to the network and the application must be ingested, correlated, and analyzed together. Effective fault management requires noise reduction and root cause analysis across service layers through automation.
Vitria VIA AIOps for Cisco Network Automation delivers improvement within the entire service assurance lifecycle, moving from noise reduction and fault detection to performance management and predictive analytics within and across the infrastructure, network, and applications. Designed to run and collect data in cloud-native environments from a wide range of sources, cloud-based application monitoring, dynamic data correlation, and root cause analysis can be implemented across vertical and horizontal application clusters, improving detection and resolution time and enabling operational cost reduction.
End-to-end service assurance
Vitria VIA AIOps provides the capabilities to deliver end-to-end service assurance as summarized in Figure 4.

Key capabilities
Full stack observability provides the right information on a timely basis to the right people to improve their efficiency and effectiveness. Persona-based views are delivered through an intuitive and dynamic UI. Views and dashboards are generated based on the data, saving staff development time. Ad hoc forensic analysis provides the flexibility required to meet unique user and environment requirements.
AI, machine learning, and advanced analytics reduce alert volume, detect service-impacting issues earlier, and distinguish symptoms from root cause across the technology stack and operational silos. Vitria VIA AIOps for Cisco Network Automation automatically determines the correct algorithm to use on collected data to generate baselines and detect signals. This enables operations teams to focus their attention only on the anomalies requiring action. False positives and true negatives are filtered out, improving operator effectiveness and reducing operator fatigue from excessive alert volumes. Baselines using intraday seasonality identify performance issues earlier than threshold-based systems, improving both the mean time to detect and mean time to repair. Continuous learning sustains optimal baselines across billions of dimensions and metrics with dynamic baseline changes as new data is collected.
Real-time analytic pipeline collects, enriches, and analyzes streaming data in real time and delivers dynamic analysis and root cause identification across vertical and horizontal applications and workload layers (see Figure 5). Vitria VIA AIOps for Cisco Network Automation makes existing systems and fix agents more efficient with intelligent and timely insights.
Unified data collection enables the Vitria VIA AIOps for Cisco Network Automation application to be implemented to optimize fault, performance, and change management processes and used for both traditional in-house and cloud-based application environments. Never-before-seen data can be directly incorporated into performance and fault management processes in a matter of minutes. MIB data can be more quickly incorporated into service assurance management processes. New traps can be ingested without code changes. Operations become more efficient by eliminating the development of thousands of lines of code to ingest and parse data sets.

Orchestrating AIOps service context with Cisco NSO
Cisco NSO is an industry-leading orchestration platform for hybrid networks. It provides comprehensive lifecycle service automation to enable the design and delivery of high-quality services much faster and more easily, reinforcing the digital transformation. In addition, it simplifies the automation of configuration tasks in a rapidly growing, complex network environment.
Gartner found that Mean Time To Identify (MTTI) and MTTK make up to 80% of the total MTTR. Applying AI and machine learning techniques substantially reduces MTTI and MTTK, as show in Figure 9. Reducing the MTTI and MTTK greatly reduces the overall MTT.
Figure 9.               
Reducing MTTR (note to reviewer – this figure is from the most recent Cisco whitepaper we updated)
Deploying Vitria VIA AIOps for Cisco Network Automation in conjunction with Cisco NSO helps enrich the service context, delivering the following benefits:
●     Bridge the disconnect between service and infrastructure views. Enrich AIOps data with service and device attributes such as service name, service components, and topology to help correlate them across the service and infrastructure layers.
●     Keep up with dynamic infrastructure. Subscribe to Cisco NSO for any changes in the service lifecycle status, underlying service components, and topology to help ensure accuracy in the analytics outcomes using machine learning techniques.
●     Prioritize based on business and service impact. Enrich AIOps with customer attributes, which, when correlated with the service and infrastructure information, helps to characterize the impact of the issues that require attention from the operator.
●     Automate service assurance through a model-driven approach. Cisco NSO enables “orchestrated assurance” to validate service status at the time of service provisioning and monitor service health throughout the service lifecycle. Based on the assurance intent expressed in the YANG model in conjunction with the definition of the service, NSO can configure the device instrumentation, such as Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and model-driven telemetry pertaining to a specific service. It can provision active probes to monitor end-to-end service status. It can also configure the AIOps system to contextualize and analyze streamed data during the entire service lifecycle, immediately after the service is provisioned until it is retired.
●     Simplify multivendor device configuration. Cisco NSO offers a single interface to configure all devices as part of closed-loop automation.
