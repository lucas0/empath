Details
Two vulnerabilities in the Cisco Firepower System Software Detection Engine could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass configured Malware and File Policies for RTF and RAR file types.
The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another; exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other.
Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows.
Cisco Firepower System Software Detection Engine RTF File Policy Bypass Vulnerability
A vulnerability in the detection engine of Cisco Firepower System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured Malware and File Policy for an RTF file type.
The vulnerability is due to incorrect detection of the RTF file syntax. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious RTF file through the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass a configured Malware and File Policy for an RTF file type.
The CVE ID for this vulnerability is CVE-2019-12697.
The SIR for this vulnerability is Medium.
Cisco Firepower System Software Detection Engine RAR File Policy Bypass Vulnerability
A vulnerability in the detection engine of Cisco Firepower System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured Malware and File Policy for a RAR file type.
The vulnerability is due to incorrect detection of the RAR file syntax. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious RAR file through the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass a configured Malware and File Policy for a RAR file type.
The CVE ID for this vulnerability is CVE-2019-12696.
The SIR for this vulnerability is Medium.
Workarounds
There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
Fixed Software
When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page, to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.
In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
Fixed Releases
In the following table, the left column lists releases of Cisco FTD Software. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.
Cisco FTD Software
Cisco FTD Software Release First Fixed Release for These Vulnerabilities
 Earlier than 6.1.01 Migrate to a fixed release.
 6.1.0 Migrate to a fixed release.
 6.2.0 Migrate to a fixed release.
 6.2.1 Migrate to a fixed release.
 6.2.2 Migrate to a fixed release.
 6.2.3 6.2.3.15
 6.3.0 6.3.0.5
 6.4.0 6.4.0.6
 6.5.0 Not vulnerable.
1. Cisco FMC and FTD Software releases 6.0.1 and earlier have reached end of software maintenance. Customers are advised to migrate to a supported release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.

To upgrade to a fixed release of Cisco FTD Software, customers can do one of the following:
For devices that are managed by using Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC), use the FMC interface to install the upgrade. After installation is complete, reapply the access control policy.
For devices that are managed by using Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM), use the FDM interface to install the upgrade. After installation is complete, reapply the access control policy.

The Snort version that is installed depends on the FMC release.

This vulnerability also applies to the open source Snort project. Please check the Snort website for additional information.
