Introduction
This document examines what happens with regard to the marking and classification of a packet at various stages within the Cisco Catalyst 6500/6000 chassis that runs Cisco IOS® Software. This document describes special cases and restrictions, and it provides short case studies.
This document does not provide an exhaustive list of all Cisco IOS Software commands that relate to QoS or marking. For more information on the Cisco IOS Software command-line interface (CLI), refer to Configuring PFC QoS.

Terminology
The list provides terminology that this document uses:
Differentiated services code point (DSCP)—The first six bits of the type of service (ToS) byte in the IP header. DSCP is only present in the IP packet.
Note: The switch also assigns an internal DSCP to every packet, whether IP or non-IP. The Four Possible Sources for Internal DSCP section of this document details this internal DSCP assignment.
IP precedence—The first three bits of the ToS byte in the IP header.
Class of service (CoS)—The only field that can be used to mark a packet at Layer 2 (L2). CoS consists of any of these three bits:
The three IEEE 802.1p (dot1p) bits in the IEEE 802.1Q (dot1q) tag for the dot1q packet.
Note: By default, Cisco switches do not tag native VLAN packets.
The three bits called "User Field" in the Inter-Switch Link (ISL) header for an ISL-encapsulated packet.
Note: CoS is not present inside a non-dot1q or an ISL packet.
Classification—The process that is used to select the traffic to be marked.
Marking—The process that sets a Layer 3 (L3) DSCP value in a packet. This document extends the definition of marking to include the setting of L2 CoS values.
Catalyst 6500/6000 series switches can make classifications on the basis of these three parameters:
DSCP
IP precedence
CoS
The Catalyst 6500/6000 series switches perform classification and marking at various stages. This is what occurs at different places:
Input port (ingress application-specific integrated circuit [ASIC])
Switching engine (PFC)
Output port (egress ASIC)
Input Port Handling
The main configuration parameter for the ingress port, with regard to classification, is the trust state of the port. Each port of the system can have one of these trust states:
trust-ip-precedence
trust-dscp
trust-cos
untrusted
In order to set or change the port trust state, issue this Cisco IOS Software command in interface mode:
6k(config-if)#mls qos trust ? 
  cos            cos keyword 
  dscp          dscp keyword 
  ip-precedence  ip-precedence keyword 
  <cr> 
Note: By default, all ports are in the untrusted state when QoS is enabled. In order to enable QoS on the Catalyst 6500 that runs Cisco IOS Software, issue the mls qos command in the main configuration mode.
At the input port level, you can also apply a default CoS per port. Here is an example:
6k(config-if)#mls qos cos cos-value
This default CoS applies to all packets, such as IP and Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX). You can apply the default CoS to any physical port.
If the port is in the untrusted state, mark the frame with the port default CoS and pass the header to the switching engine (PFC). If the port is set to one of the trust states, perform one of these two options:
If the frame does not have a received CoS (dot1q or ISL), apply the default port CoS.
For dot1q and ISL frames, keep the CoS as it is.
Then, pass the frame to the switching engine.
This example illustrates the input classification and marking. The example shows how to assign an internal CoS to each frame:
Note: As this example shows, each frame is assigned an internal CoS. The assignment is based on either the received CoS or the default port CoS. The internal CoS includes untagged frames that do not carry any real CoS. The internal CoS is written in a special packet header, which is called a data bus header, and sent over the data bus to the switching engine.
Switching Engine (PFC)
When the header reaches the switching engine, the switching engine Enhanced Address Recognition Logic (EARL) assigns each frame an internal DSCP. This internal DSCP is an internal priority that is assigned to the frame by the PFC as the frame transits the switch. This is not the DSCP in the IP version 4 (IPv4) header. The internal DSCP is derived from an existing CoS or ToS setting and is used to reset the CoS or ToS as the frame exits the switch. This internal DSCP is assigned to all frames that are switched or routed by the PFC, even non-IP frames.
This section discusses how you can assign a service policy to the interface in order to make a marking. The section also discusses the final setting of the internal DSCP, which depends on the port trust state and the service policy that is applied.
Configure the Service Policy to Classify or Mark a Packet in Cisco IOS Software Release 12.1(12c)E and Later
Complete these steps in order to configure the service policy:
Configure an access control list (ACL) to define the traffic that you want to consider.
The ACL can be numbered or named, and the Catalyst 6500/6000 supports an extended ACL. Issue the access-list xxx Cisco IOS Software command, as this example shows:
(config)#access-list 101 permit ip any host 10.1.1.1
Configure a traffic class (class map) to match the traffic on the basis of the ACL that you have defined or on the basis of the received DSCP.
Issue the class-map Cisco IOS Software command. PFC QoS does not support more than one match statement per class map. Also, PFC QoS only supports these match statements:
match ip access-group
match ip dscp
match ip precedence
match protocol
Note: The match protocol command enables the use of Network Based Application Recognition (NBAR) to match traffic.
Note: Of these options, only the match ip dscp and match ip precedence statements are supported and work. These statements, however, are not useful in the marking or classification of the packets. You can use these statements, for example, to make policing on all packets that match a certain DSCP. However, this action is beyond the scope of this document.
(config)#class-map class-name

(config-cmap)#match {access-group | input-interface | ip dscp} 
Note: This example shows only three options for the match command. But you can configure many more options at this command prompt.
Note: Any one of the options in this match command is taken for match criteria and the other options are left out, according to the incoming packets.
Here is an example:
class-map match-any TEST 
 match access-group 101 

class-map match-all TEST2 
 match ip precedence 6
Configure a policy map to apply a policy to a class that you previously defined.
The policy map contains:
A name
A set of class statements
For each class statement, the action that needs to be taken for that class
The supported actions in PFC1 and PFC2 QoS are:
trust dscp
trust ip precedence
trust cos
set ip dscp in Cisco IOS Software Release 12.1(12c)E1 and later
set ip precedence in Cisco IOS Software Release 12.1(12c)E1 and later
police
Note: This action is beyond the scope of this document.
(config)#policy-map policy-name
 
(config-pmap)#class class-name

(config-pmap-c)#{police | set ip dscp}
Note: This example shows only two options, but you can configure many more options at this (config-pmap-c)# command prompt.
Here is an example:
policy-map test_policy 
 class TEST 
   trust ip precedence 
 class TEST2 
   set ip dscp 16
Configure a service policy input to apply a policy map that you previously defined to one or more interface.
Note: You can attach a service policy to either the physical interface or to the switched virtual interface (SVI) or VLAN interface. If you attach a service policy to a VLAN interface, the only ports that use this service policy are ports that belong to that VLAN and are configured for VLAN-based QoS. If the port is not set for VLAN-based QoS, the port still uses the default port-based QoS and only looks at the service policy that is attached to the physical interface.
This example applies the service policy test_policy to the port Gigabit Ethernet 1/1:
(config) interface gigabitethernet 1/1 
(config-if)#service-policy input test_policy
This example applies the service policy test_policy to all ports in VLAN 10 that have a VLAN-based configuration from the QoS point of view:
(config) interface gigabitethernet 1/2 
(config-if)#switchport mode access 
(config-if)#switchport access vlan 10 
(config-if)#mls qos vlan-based 
(config-if)#exit 
(config-if)#interface vlan 10 
(config-if)#service-policy input test_policy
Note: You can combine Step 2 and Step 3 of this procedure if you skip the specific definition of the class and attach the ACL directly in the definition of the policy map. In this example, where the class TEST police has not been defined prior to the configuration of the policy map, the class is defined within the policy map:
(config)#policy-map policy-name
 
(config-pmap)#class class_name {access-group acl_index_or_name |
             dscp dscp_1 [dscp_2 [dscp_N]] | precedence ipp_1 [ipp_2 [ipp_N]]}

!--- Note: This command should be on one line.
 
policy-map TEST 
class TEST police access-group 101
Configure the Service Policy to Classify or Mark a Packet in Cisco IOS Software Releases Earlier Than Cisco IOS Software Release 12.1(12c)E
In Cisco IOS Software releases earlier than Cisco IOS Software Release 12.1(12c)E1, you cannot use the set ip dscp or set ip precedence action in a policy map. Therefore, the only way to make a marking of specific traffic that a class defines is to configure a policer with a very high rate. This rate should be, for example, at least the line rate of the port or something high enough to allow all the traffic to hit that policer. Then, use set-dscp-transmit xx as the conform action. Follow these steps in order to set up this configuration:
Configure an ACL to define the traffic that you want to consider.
The ACL can be numbered or named, and the Catalyst 6500/6000 supports an extended ACL. Issue the access-list xxx Cisco IOS Software command, as this example shows:
(config)#access-list 101 permit ip any host 10.1.1.1
Configure a traffic class (class map) to match the traffic on the basis of either the ACL that you have defined or on the basis of the received DSCP.
Issue the class-map Cisco IOS Software command. PFC QoS does not support more than one match statement per class map. Also, PFC QoS only supports these match statements:
match ip access-group
match ip dscp
match ip precedence
match protocol
Note: The match protocol command enables the use of NBAR to match traffic.
Note: Of these statements, only the match ip dscp and match ip precedence statements are supported and work. These statements, however, are not useful in marking or the classification of the packets. You can use these statements, for example, to make policing on all packets that match a certain DSCP. However, this action is beyond the scope of this document.
(config)#class-map  class-name

(config-cmap)#match {access-group | input-interface | ip dscp}
Note: This example shows only three options for the match command. But you can configure many more options at this command prompt.
Here is an example:
class-map match-any TEST 
 match access-group 101 

class-map match-all TEST2 
 match ip precedence 6
Configure a policy map to apply a policy to a class that you previously defined.
The policy map contains:
A name
A set of class statements
For each class statement, the action that needs to be taken for that class
The supported actions in PFC1 or PFC2 QoS are:
trust dscp
trust ip precedence
trust cos
police
You must use the police statement because the set ip dscp and set ip precedence actions are not supported. Since you do not actually want to police the traffic, but just to mark it, use a policer that is defined to allow all traffic. Therefore, configure the policer with a large rate and burst. For example, you can configure the policer with the maximum allowed rate and burst. Here is an example:
policy-map test_policy 
 class TEST 
   trust ip precedence 
 class TEST2 
   police  4000000000 31250000 conform-action
   set-dscp-transmit 16 exceed-action policed-dscp-transmit
Configure a service policy input to apply a policy map that you previously defined to one or more interfaces.
Note: The service policy can be attached to either a physical interface or to the SVI or VLAN interface. If a service policy is attached to a VLAN interface, only ports that belong to that VLAN and that are configured for VLAN-based QoS use this service policy. If the port is not set for VLAN-based QoS, the port still uses the default port-based QoS and only looks at a service policy that is attached to the physical interface.
This example applies the service policy test_policy to the port Gigabit Ethernet 1/1:
(config) interface gigabitethernet 1/1 
(config-if)#service-policy input test_policy
This example applies the service policy test_policy to all ports in VLAN 10 that have a VLAN-based configuration from the QoS point of view:
(config) interface gigabitethernet 1/2 
(config-if)#switchport mode access 
(config-if)#switchport access vlan 10 
(config-if)#mls qos vlan-based 
(config-if)#exit 
(config-if)#interface vlan 10 
(config-if)#service-policy input test_policy
Four Possible Sources for Internal DSCP
The internal DSCP is derived from one of these:
An existing received DSCP value, which is set before the frame enters the switch
An example is trust dscp.
The received IP precedence bits that are already set in the IPv4 header
Because there are 64 DSCP values and only eight IP precedence values, the administrator configures a mapping that the switch uses to derive the DSCP. Default mappings are in place, in the case that the administrator does not configure the maps. An example is trust ip precedence.
The received CoS bits that are already set before the frame enters the switch and which are stored in the data bus header, or if there was no CoS in the incoming frame, from the default CoS of the incoming port
As with IP precedence, there are a maximum of eight CoS values, each of which must be mapped to one of the 64 DSCP values. The administrator can configure this map, or the switch can use the default map that is already in place.
The service policy can set the internal DSCP to a specific value.
For numbers 2 and 3 in this list, the static mapping is by default, in this manner:
For CoS-to-DSCP mapping, the DSCP that is derived equals eight times the CoS.
For IP precedence-to-DSCP mapping, the DSCP that is derived equals eight times the IP precedence.
You can issue these commands in order to override and verify this static mapping:
mls qos map ip-prec-dscp dscp_1 dscp_2 dscp_3 dscp_4 dscp_5 dscp_6 dscp_7 dscp_8
mls qos map cos-dscp dscp_1 dscp_2 dscp_3 dscp_4 dscp_5 dscp_6 dscp_7 dscp_8
The first value of the DSCP that corresponds to the mapping for the CoS (or IP precedence) is 0. The second value for the CoS (or IP precedence) is 1, and the pattern continues in this way. For example, this command changes the mapping so that the CoS 0 is mapped to the DSCP of 0, and the CoS of 1 is mapped to the DSCP of 8, and so on:
Cat65(config)#mls qos map cos-dscp 0 8 16 26 32 46 48 54 
Cat65#show mls qos maps 
CoS-dscp map: 
 cos:     0 1  2   3   4   5   6   7 
  ----------------------------------- 
 dscp:    0 8 16  26  32  46  48  54 
How Is the Internal DSCP Chosen?
The internal DSCP is chosen on the basis of these parameters:
The QoS policy map that is applied to the packet
The QoS policy map is determined by these rules:
If no service policy is attached to the incoming port or VLAN, use the default.
Note: This default action is to set the internal DSCP to 0.
If a service policy is attached to the incoming port or VLAN, and if the traffic matches one of the classes that the policy defines, use this entry.
If a service policy is attached to the incoming port or VLAN, and if the traffic does not match one of the classes that the policy defines, use the default.
The trust state of the port and the action of the policy map
When the port has a specific trust state and a policy with a certain marking (trusting action at the same time), these rules apply:
The set ip dscp command or the DSCP that is defined per policer in a policy map is only applied if the port is left in the untrusted state.
If the port has a trust state, this trust state is used to derive the internal DSCP. The port trust state always takes precedence over the set ip dscp command.
The trust xx command in a policy map takes precedence over the port trust state.
If the port and the policy contain a different trust state, the trust state that comes from the policy map is considered.
Therefore, the internal DSCP depends on these factors:
The port trust state
The service policy (with use of ACL) that is attached to the port
The default policy map
Note: The default resets the DSCP to 0.
Whether VLAN-based or port-based with regard to the ACL
This diagram summarizes how the internal DSCP is chosen on the basis of the configuration:
The PFC is also able to do policing. This can eventually result in a markdown of the internal DSCP. For more information on policing, refer to QoS Policing on Catalyst 6500/6000 Series Switches.
Output Port Handling
You cannot do anything at the egress port level in order to change the classification. However, mark the packet on the basis of these rules:
If the packet is an IPv4 packet, copy the internal DSCP that the switching engine assigns into the ToS byte of the IPv4 header.
If the output port is configured for an ISL or dot1q encapsulation, use a CoS that is derived from the internal DSCP. Copy the CoS in the ISL or dot1q frame.
Note: The CoS is derived from the internal DSCP according to a static. Issue this command in order to configure the static:
Router(config)#mls qos map dscp-cos dscp1 [dscp2 [dscp3 [dscp4
              [dscp5 [dscp6 [dscp7 [dscp8]]]]]]] to cos_value


!--- Note: This command should be on one line.
The default configurations appear here. By default, the CoS is the integer part of the DSCP, divided by eight. Issue this command in order to see and verify the mapping:
cat6k#show mls qos maps
...
  Dscp-cos map:                                  (dscp= d1d2)
     d1 :  d2 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 
     -------------------------------------
      0 :    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 01 
      1 :    01 01 01 01 01 01 02 02 02 02 
      2 :    02 02 02 02 03 03 03 03 03 03 
      3 :    03 03 04 04 04 04 04 04 04 04 
      4 :    05 05 05 05 05 05 05 05 06 06 
      5 :    06 06 06 06 06 06 07 07 07 07 
      6 :    07 07 07 07
In order to change this mapping, issue this configuration command in the normal configuration mode:
mls qos map dscp-cos 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 to 0
mls qos map dscp-cos 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 to 1
mls qos map dscp-cos 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 to 2
...
After the DSCP is written into the IP header and the CoS is derived from the DSCP, the packet is sent to one of the output queues for output scheduling on the basis of the CoS. This occurs even if the packet is not a dot1q or an ISL. For more information on output queue scheduling, refer to QoS Output Scheduling on Catalyst 6500/6000 Series Switches Running Cisco IOS System Software.
This diagram summarizes the processing of the packet with regard to marking in the output port:
Notes and Limitations
The Default ACL
The default ACL uses "dscp 0" as the classification keyword. All traffic that enters the switch through an untrusted port and does not hit a service policy entry is marked with a DSCP of 0 if QoS is enabled. Currently, you cannot change the default ACL in Cisco IOS Software.
Note: In Catalyst OS (CatOS) software, you can configure and change this default behavior. For more information, refer to the The Default ACL section of QoS Classification and Marking on Catalyst 6500/6000 Series Switches Running CatOS Software.
Limitations of the WS-X61xx, WS-X6248-xx, WS-X6224-xx, and WS-X6348-xx Line Cards
This section only concerns these line cards:
WS-X6224-100FX-MT: Catalyst 6000 24-Port 100 FX Multimode
WS-X6248-RJ-45: Catalyst 6000 48-Port 10/100 RJ-45 Module

WS-X6148-RJ45V: Catalyst 6500 48-Port 10/100 Inline Power
These line cards have a limitation. At the port level, you cannot configure the trust state with the use of any of these keywords:
trust-dscp
trust-ipprec
trust-cos
You can only use the untrusted state. Any attempt to configure a trust state on one of these ports displays one of these warning messages:
Tank(config-if)#mls qos trust ?      
  extend  extend keyword
Tank(config-if)#mls qos trust 
% Incomplete command.
Tank(config-if)#mls qos trust cos
                              ^
% Invalid input detected at '^' marker.
Tank(config-if)#mls qos trust ip-pre
                              ^
% Invalid input detected at '^' marker.
You must attach a service policy to the port or the VLAN if you want a trusting frame to come in on such a line card. Use the method in the Case 1: Marking at the Edge section of this document.
Packets That Come from the MSFC1 or MSFC2 on Supervisor Engine 1A/PFC
All packets that come from the MSFC1 or MSFC2 have a CoS of 0. The packet can be either a software-routed packet or a packet that the MSFC issues. This is a limitation of the PFC because it resets the CoS of all packets that come from the MSFC. The DSCP and IP precedence are still maintained. The PFC2 does not have this limitation. The exiting CoS of the PFC2 is equal to the IP precedence of the packet.
Summary of Classification
The tables in this section show the DSCP that results on the basis of these classifications:
The incoming port trust state
The classification keyword within the applied ACL
This table provides is a generic summary for all ports except WS-X62xx and WS-X63xx:

Monitor and Verify a Configuration
Check the Port Configuration
Issue the show queuing interface interface-id command in order to verify the port settings and configurations.
When you issue this command, you can verify these classification parameters, among other parameters:
Whether port-based or VLAN-based
The trust port type
The ACL that is attached to the port
Here is a sample of this command output. The important fields with regard to classification appear in boldface:
6500#show queuing interface gigabitethernet 3/2 
Interface GigabitEthernet3/2 queuing strategy:  Weighted Round-Robin 
  Port QoS is enabled 
  Trust state: trust COS 
  Default COS is 0 
  Transmit queues [type = 1p2q2t]:
The output shows that the configuration of this specific port is with trust cos on the port level. Also, the default port CoS is 0.
Check Defined Classes
Issue the show class-map command in order to check the defined classes. Here is an example:
Boris#show class-map 
 Class Map match-all test (id 3) 
   Match access-group  112 

 Class Map match-any class-default (id 0) 
   Match any 
 Class Map match-all voice (id 4)
Check the Policy Map That Is Applied to an Interface
Issue these commands in order to check the policy map that is applied and seen in previous commands:
show mls qos ip interface interface-id
show policy-map interface interface-id
Here are samples of the output from the issue of these commands:
Boris#show mls qos ip gigabitethernet 1/1
   [In] Default.   [Out] Default.

Sample Case Studies
This section provides sample configurations of common cases that can appear in a network.
Case 1: Marking at the Edge
Assume that you configure a Catalyst 6000 that is used as an access switch. Many users connect to the switch slot 2, which is a WS-X6348 line card (10/100 Mbps). The users can send:
Normal data traffic—This traffic is always in VLAN 100 and needs to get a DSCP of 0.
Voice traffic from an IP phone—This traffic is always in the voice auxiliary VLAN 101 and needs to get a DSCP of 46.
Mission-critical application traffic—This traffic also comes in VLAN 100 and is directed to server 10.10.10.20. This traffic needs to get a DSCP of 32.
The application does not mark any of this traffic. Therefore, leave the port as untrusted and configure a specific ACL to classify the traffic. One ACL is applied to VLAN 100, and one ACL is applied to VLAN 101. You also need to configure all ports as VLAN-based. Here is an example of the configuration that results:
Boris(config)#mls qos
Boris(config)#interface range fastethernet 2/1-48
Boris(config-if)#mls qos vlan-based
Boris(config-if)#exit
Boris(config)#ip access-list extended Mission_critical
Boris(config-ext-nacl)#permit ip any host 10.10.10.20
Boris(config)#ip access-list extended Voice_traffic
Boris(config-ext-nacl)#permit ip any any
Boris(config)#class-map voice 

Boris(config-cmap)#match access-group Voice_traffic
Boris(config)#class-map Critical

Boris(config-cmap)#match access-group Mission_critical
Boris(config)#policy-map Voice_vlan
Boris(config-pmap)#class voice
Boris(config-pmap-c)#set ip dscp 46
Boris(config)#policy-map Data_vlan
Boris(config-pmap)#class Critical
Boris(config-pmap-c)#set ip dscp 32
Boris(config)#interface vlan 100
Boris(config-if)#service-policy input Data_vlan
Boris(config)#interface vlan 101
Boris(config-if)#service-policy input Voice_vlan
Case 2: Trusting in the Core with Only Gigabit Ethernet Interfaces
Assume that you configure a core Catalyst 6000 with only a Gigabit Ethernet interface in slot 1 and slot 2. The access switches previously marked traffic correctly. Therefore, you do not need to make any remarking. However, you need to ensure that the core switch does trust the incoming DSCP. This case is the easier case because all ports are marked as trust-dscp, which should be sufficient:
6k(config)#mls qos
6k(config)#interface range gigabitethernet 1/1-2 , gigabitethernet 2/1-2
6k(config-if)#mls qos trust dscp
