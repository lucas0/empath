Cisco® 4400 Series Integrated Services Router Network Interface Modules (ISRNIMs) provide highly reliable synchronous serial WAN connections for remote sites. These interfaces use well-known point-to-point WAN protocols such as High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) and Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) as well as Frame Relay, offering cost-effective virtualized WAN connections in both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint designs. You can mix and match NIMs to tailor cost-effective solutions for common networking solutions for low- and high-density WAN aggregation.
Cisco offers three new synchronous serial NIMs:
● Cisco 1-Port Serial WAN Network Interface Card (NIM-1T)
● Cisco 2-Port Serial WAN Network Interface Card (NIM-2T)
● Cisco 4-Port Serial WAN Network Interface Card (NIM-4T)
WAN Access and Aggregation
Figure 1 shows two typical serial WAN connection scenarios between two locations. With support for serial speeds up to 8 Mbps per port, the 2- and 4-port serial NIMs are ideal for low- and medium-density WAN aggregation (Figure 2). Bisynchronous and X.25 standards are not supported on these modules.

Connectors and Cabling
The NIM-1T, NIM-2T, and NIM-4T use Cisco Smart Serial connectors. These ports use the same connectors and cabling as the HWIC-4A/S and HWIC-2A/S modules for the Cisco Integrated Services Routers Generation 2 (ISRG2) routers. The supported cables are noted in Table 3.
