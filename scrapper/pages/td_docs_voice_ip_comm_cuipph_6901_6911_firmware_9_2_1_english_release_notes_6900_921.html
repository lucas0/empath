New and Changed Information
This section contains the following topics:
•CME Version Negotiation
•EnergyWise
•IPv6 Support
•SSH Access
•UCR 2008 Support
CME Version Negotiation
The Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express (Unified CME) Version Negotiation feature supports a SIS version in the supported tag. The Cisco Unified IP Phones use the supported tag to interact with Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express and its supported SIS version.
The following phone models support the CME Version Negotiation:
•Cisco Unified IP Phone 6901 (SIP only)
•Cisco Unified IP Phone 6911 (SIP only)
EnergyWise
Cisco EnergyWise program promotes company-wide sustainability by monitoring, reporting, and reducing energy consumption across an entire corporate infrastructure. In the Cisco Unified IP Phone firmware, the EnergyWise feature allows phones to participate in an EnergyWise-enabled system. The phones can report power usage to the EnergyWise domain to allow the tracking and control of power within the customer premise.
In the Cisco Unified IP Phones, the EnergyWise feature enables the phone to sleep (power down) and wake (power up). A sleeping phone reduces energy consumption, typically into the 0 to 1 watt range. The administrator sets a working schedule of days, power up times, and power down times for each phone. At the scheduled power down time, the phone automatically powers down, and at the scheduled power up time, the phone automatically powers up.
The following Cisco Unified IP Phones (SCCP and SIP) support EnergyWise in this release:
•Cisco Unified IP Phone 6901
•Cisco Unified IP Phone 6911
Cisco IOS support
In order for the phones to receive the power down and power up messages, the switch must also support the EnergyWise feature. The following table shows the versions of the Cisco switches that support EnergyWise.

Limitations
For EnergyWise support, the Cisco Unified CM release 7.1, 8.0 and 8.5 require device pack installation. The EnergyWise is included in Cisco Unified CM release 8.6.
IPv6 Support
The Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is an updated version of the current Internet Protocol, IPv4. IPv6 uses a 128-bit address and provides end-to-end security capabilities, enhanced Quality of Service (QoS), and increased number of available IP addresses. Cisco Unified IP Phones support the use of IPv6 only with the Skinny Call Control Protocol (SCCP).
This feature is supported on the following Cisco Unified IP Phones (SCCP):
•Cisco Unified IP Phone 6901
•Cisco Unified IP Phone 6911
SSH Access
The SSH Access settings option allows the administrator to enable or disable the SSH port on the phone using Cisco Unified CM Administration. When enabled, it allows the phone to accept the SSH connections. Disabling the SSH server functionality of the phone blocks the SSH access to the phone. This setting is disabled by default.
This feature is supported on the following Cisco Unified IP Phones (SCCP and SIP):
•Cisco Unified IP Phone 6901
•Cisco Unified IP Phone 6911
Limitations
For phones with SSH access, the Cisco Unified CM release 7.1, 8.0 and 8.5 require device pack installation. The SSH access is included in Cisco Unified CM release 8.6.
UCR 2008 Support
The Unified Capabilities Requirements (UCR) 2008 feature provides the following functions:
•Support for Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 104-2 Level—The phone requires the following functions:
–Power On Self Testing—to ensure that the appropriate encryption algorithms are available. If the phone does not have the correct modules in the firmware, the phone will fail to boot.
–Cisco Unified Communications Manager to be set up for FIPS compliance (for example, disabling 802.1x EAP-MD5).
•Support of IPv4 and IPv6 addressing
•Support of 80-bit SRTCP Tagging—The phone handles both 32-bit and 80-bit SRTCP tags.
•DSCP tagging for network management traffic
•Multilevel Precedence and Preemption (MLPP)—When placing a call, users can select a precedence level and have the call preempt an existing call of a lower priority.
The UCR 2008 feature is supported on the following Cisco Unified IP Phones (SCCP):
•Cisco Unified IP Phone 6901
•Cisco Unified IP Phone 6911
Limitations
For UCR 2008 support, the Cisco Unified CM release 7.1, 8.0 and 8.5 require device pack installation. The UCR 2008 is included in Cisco Unified CM release 8.6.
