Cisco Physical Security Modules for Routers
Integrate Branch Office Video Surveillance over your IP Network
The Cisco IP Video Surveillance solution allows for rapid deployment over a highly distributed area.

This solution helps to enable:
Consolidation of branch office servers through centralized deployment
Real-time access to physical security video and data
Use of analog, IP, or hybrid video cameras and encoders
Low total cost of ownership by using the IP network infrastructure
Ease of integration through network transparency, reliable data interoperability, and maximized overall security
