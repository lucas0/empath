Configure Control Plane Security Parameters
By default, the control plane uses DTLS as the protocol that provides privacy on all its tunnels. DTLS runs over UDP.
You can change the control plane security protocol to TLS, which runs over TCP. The primary reason to use TLS is that, if you consider the vSmart controller to be a server, firewalls protect TCP servers better than UDP servers.
You configure the control plane tunnel protocol on a vSmart controller:
vSmart(config)# security control protocol tls
With this change, all control plane tunnels between the vSmart controller and the routers and between the controller and vManage use TLS. Control plane tunnels to vBond orchestrators always use DTLS, because these connections must be handled by UDP.
In a domain with multiple vSmart controllers, when you configure TLS on one of the vSmart controllers, all control plane tunnels from that controller to the other controllers use TLS. Said another way, TLS always takes precedence over DTLS. However, from the perspective of the other vSmart controllers, if you have not configured TLS on them, they use TLS on the control plane tunnel only to that one vSmart controller, and they use DTLS tunnels to all the other vSmart controllers and to all their connected routers. To have all vSmart controllers use TLS, configure it on all of them.
By default, the vSmart controller listens on port 23456 for TLS requests. To change this:
vSmart(config)# security control tls-port number
The port can be a number from 1025 through 65535.
To display control plane security information, use the show control connections command on the vSmart controller. For example:
vSmart-2# show control connections

Configure DTLS in Cisco SD-WAN Manager
If you configure the Cisco SD-WAN Manager to use TLS as the control plane security protocol, you must enable port forwarding on your NAT. If you are using DTLS as the control plane security protocol, you do not need to do anything.
The number of ports forwarded depends on the number of vdaemon processes running on the Cisco SD-WAN Manager. To display information about these processes and about and the number of ports that are being forwarded, use the show control summary command shows that four vdaemon processes are running:
vManage# show control summary
          VBOND     VMANAGE    VSMART    VEDGE

This output shows that the listening TCP port is 23456. If you are running Cisco SD-WAN Manager behind a NAT, you should open the following ports on the NAT device:
23456 (base - instance 0 port)
23456 + 100 (base + 100)
23456 + 200 (base + 200)
23456 + 300 (base + 300)
Note that the number of instances is the same as the number of cores you have assigned for the Cisco SD-WAN Manager, up to a maximum of 8.
Configure Security Parameters Using the Security Feature Template
Use the Cisco Security feature template for all Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices and. On the edge routers and on Cisco vBond orchestrators, use this template to configure IPsec for data plane security. On Cisco vManage and Cisco vSmart controllers, use the Security feature template to configure DTLS or TLS for control plane security.
Configure Security Parameters
From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Configuration > Templates.
Click Feature Templates and then click Add Template.

Note
In Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1 and earlier releases, Feature Templates is called Feature.
From the Devices list in the left pane, choose a device.
The templates applicable to the selected device appear in the right pane.
Click Cisco Security to open the template.
In the Template Name field, enter a name for the template. The name can be up to 128 characters and can contain only alphanumeric characters.
In the Template Description field, enter a description of the template. The description can be up to 2048 characters and can contain only alphanumeric characters.
When you first open a feature template, for each parameter that has a default value, the scope is set to Default (indicated by a check mark), and the default setting or value is shown. To change the default or to enter a value, click the scope drop-down menu to the left of the parameter field and choose one of the following:
Table 1.
Parameter Scope
Scope Description
Device Specific (indicated by a host icon)
Use a device-specific value for the parameter. For device-specific parameters, you cannot enter a value in the feature template. You enter the value when you attach a Viptela device to a device template .
When you click Device Specific, the Enter Key box opens. This box displays a key, which is a unique string that identifies the parameter in a CSV file that you create. This file is an Excel spreadsheet that contains one column for each key. The header row contains the key names (one key per column), and each row after that corresponds to a device and defines the values of the keys for that device. You upload the CSV file when you attach a Viptela device to a device template. For more information, see Create a Template Variables Spreadsheet .
To change the default key, type a new string and move the cursor out of the Enter Key box.
Examples of device-specific parameters are system IP address, hostname, GPS location, and site ID.
Global (indicated by a globe icon)
Enter a value for the parameter, and apply that value to all devices.
Examples of parameters that you might apply globally to a group of devices are DNS server, syslog server, and interface MTUs.
Configure Control Plane Security

Parameter Name
Description
Authentication Type
Select the authentication types from the Authentication List, and click the arrow pointing right to move the authentication types to the Selected List column.
Authentication types supported from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a:
esp: Enables Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) encryption and integrity checking on the ESP header.
ip-udp-esp: Enables ESP encryption. In addition to the integrity checks on the ESP header and payload, the checks also include the outer IP and UDP headers.
ip-udp-esp-no-id: Ignores the ID field in the IP header so that Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN can work in conjunction with the non-Cisco devices.
none: Turns integrity checking off on IPSec packets. We don't recommend using this option.
Authentication types supported in Cisco IOS XE Release 17.5.1a and earlier:
ah-no-id: Enable an enhanced version of AH-SHA1 HMAC and ESP HMAC-SHA1 that ignores the ID field in the packet's outer IP header.
ah-sha1-hmac: Enable AH-SHA1 HMAC and ESP HMAC-SHA1.
none: Select no authentication.
sha1-hmac: Enable ESP HMAC-SHA1.
Note
  For an edge device running on Cisco IOS XE Release 17.5.1a or earlier, you may have configured authentication types using a Cisco Security template. When you upgrade the device to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a or later, update the selected authentication types in the Cisco Security template to the authentication types supported from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a . To update the authentication types, do the following:
From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Configuration > Templates.
Click Feature Templates.
Find the Cisco Security template to update and click … and click Edit.
Click Update. Do not modify any configuration.
Cisco SD-WAN Manager updates the Cisco Security template to display the supported authentication types.

Authentication Types in Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a and Later
From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.6.1, the following integrity types are supported:
esp: This option enables Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) encryption and integrity checking on the ESP header.
ip-udp-esp: This option enables ESP encryption. In addition to the integrity checks on the ESP header and the payload, the checks also include the outer IP and UDP headers.
ip-udp-esp-no-id: This option is is similar to ip-udp-esp, however, the ID field of the outer IP header is ignored. Configure this option in the list of integrity types to have the Cisco SD-WAN software ignore the ID field in the IP header so that the Cisco SD-WAN can work in conjunction with non-Cisco devices.
none: This option turns integrity checking off on IPSec packets. We don't recommend using this option.
By default, IPsec tunnel connections use an enhanced version of the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) protocol for authentication. To modify the negotiated interity types, use the following command:
security ipsec integrity-type { none | ip-udp-esp | ip-udp-esp-no-id | esp }
Authentication Types Before Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a
By default, IPsec tunnel connections use an enhanced version of the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) protocol for authentication. To modify the negotiated authentication types, use the following command:
Device(config)# security ipsec authentication-type (ah-sha1-hmac | ah-no-id | sha1-hmac | )
By default, IPsec tunnel connections use AES-GCM-256, which provides both encryption and authentication.
Configure each authentication type with a separate security ipsec authentication-type command. The command options map to the following authentication types, which are listed in order from most strong to least strong:

Note
The sha1 in the configuration options is used for historical reasons. The authentication options indicate over how much of the packet integrity checking is done. They do not specify the algorithm that checks the integrity. The authentication algorithms supported by Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN do not use SHA1.
ah-sha1-hmac enables encryption and encapsulation using ESP. However, in addition to the integrity checks on the ESP header and payload, the checks also include the outer IP and UDP headers. Hence, this option supports an integrity check of the packet similar to the Authentication Header (AH) protocol. All integrity and encryption is performed using AES-256-GCM.
ah-no-id enables a mode that is similar to ah-sha1-hmac, however the ID field of the outer IP header is ignored. This option accommodates some non-Cisco SD-WAN devices, including the Apple AirPort Express NAT, that have a bug that causes the ID field in the IP header, a non-mutable field, to be modified. Configure the ah-no-id option in the list of authentication types to have the Cisco SD-WAN AH software ignore the ID field in the IP header so that the Cisco SD-WAN software can work in conjunction with these devices.
sha1-hmac enables ESP encryption and integrity checking.
For information about which data packet fields are affected by these authentication types, see Data Plane Integrity.
Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices and Cisco vEdge devices advertise their configured authentication types in their TLOC properties. The two routers on either side of an IPsec tunnel connection negotiate the authentication to use on the connection between them, using the strongest authentication type that is configured on both of the routers. For example, if one router advertises the ah-sha1-hmac and ah-no-id types, and a second router advertises the ah-no-id type, the two routers negotiate to use ah-no-id on the IPsec tunnel connection between them. If no common authentication types are configured on the two peers, no IPsec tunnel is established between them.
For the unicast traffic, the encryption algorithm on IPSec tunnel connections is AES-256-GCM. From Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Release 17.2.1r, the multicast traffic also supports AES-256-GCM encryption algorithm. You cannot modify the encryption algorithm choice made by the software.
When the IPsec authentication type is changed, the AES key for the data path is changed.
Change the Rekeying Timer
Before Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices and Cisco vEdge devices can exchange data traffic, they set up a secure authenticated communications channel between them. The routers use IPSec tunnels between them as the channel, and the AES-256 cipher to perform encryption. Each router generates a new AES key for its data path periodically.
By default, a key is valid for 86400 seconds (24 hours), and the timer range is 10 seconds through 1209600 seconds (14 days). To change the rekey timer value:
Device(config)# security ipsec 
rekey seconds
The configuration looks like this:
security  
    ipsec    
      rekey seconds
    !
If you want to generate new IPsec keys immediately, you can do so without modifying the configuration of the router. To do this, issue the request platform software sdwan security ipsec-rekey command on the compromised router.
For example, the following output shows that the local SA has a Security Parameter Index (SPI) of 256:
Device# show sdwan ipsec local-sa
         
                                          SOURCE           SOURCE             
TLOC ADDRESS     TLOC COLOR       SPI     IP               PORT    KEY HASH   
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
172.16.255.15    lte              256     10.1.15.15       12346   *****b93a 
A unique key is associated with each SPI. If this key is compromised, use the request platform software sdwan security ipsec-rekey command to generate a new key immediately. This command increments the SPI. In our example, the SPI changes to 257 and the key associated with it is now used:
Device# request platform software sdwan security ipsec-rekey
Device# show sdwan ipsec local-sa
                                          SOURCE           SOURCE             
TLOC ADDRESS     TLOC COLOR       SPI     IP               PORT    KEY HASH   
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
172.16.255.15    lte              257     10.1.15.15       12346   *****b93a 
After the new key is generated, the router sends it immediately to the vSmart(s) using DTLS or TLS. The vSmart(s) send the key to the peer routers. The routers begin using it as soon as they receive it. Note that the key associated with the old SPI (256) will continue to be used for a short period of time, until it times out.
To stop using the old key immediately, issue the request platform software sdwan security ipsec-rekey command twice, in quick succession. This sequence of commands removes both SPI 256 and 257 and sets the SPI to 258. The router then uses the associated key of SPI 258. Note, however, that some packets will be dropped for a short period of time, until all the remote routers learn the new key.

Change the Size of the Anti-Replay Window
IPsec authentication provides anti-replay protection by assigning a unique sequence number to each packet in a data stream. This sequence numbering protects against an attacker duplicating data packets. With anti-replay protection, the sender assigns monotonically increasing sequence numbers, and the destination checks these sequence numbers to detect duplicates. Because packets often do not arrive in order, the destination maintains a sliding window of sequence numbers that it will accept.
Packets with sequence numbers that fall to the left of the sliding window range are considered old or duplicates, and the destination drops them. The destination tracks the highest sequence number it has received, and adjusts the sliding window when it receives a packet with a higher value.
By default, the sliding window is set to 512 packets. It can be set to any value between 64 and 4096 that is a power of 2 (that is, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, or 4096). To modify the anti-replay window size, use the replay-window command, specifying the size of the window:
Device(config)# security ipsec replay-window 
number
The configuration looks like this:
security  
   ipsec
     replay-window number
   !
!
To help with QoS, separate replay windows are maintained for each of the first eight traffic channels. The configured replay window size is divided by eight for each channel.
If QoS is configured on a router, that router might experience a larger than expected number of packet drops as a result of the IPsec anti-replay mechanism, and many of the packets that are dropped are legitimate ones. This occurs because QoS reorders packets, giving higher-priority packets preferential treatment and delaying lower-priority packets. To minimize or prevent this situation, you can do the following:
Increase the size of the anti-replay window.
Engineer traffic onto the first eight traffic channels to ensure that traffic within a channel is not reordered.
VPN Interface IPsec
Use the VPN Interface IPsec feature template to configure IPsec tunnels on Cisco IOS XE service VPNs that are being used for Internet Key Exchange (IKE) sessions. You can configure IPsec on tunnels for VPN 1 through 65530, except for 512.
Cisco Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices use VRFs in place of VPNs. However, the following steps still apply to configure Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices through Cisco SD-WAN Manager. In Cisco SD-WAN Manager, the system automatically maps the VPN configurations to VRF configurations.

Changing the Scope for a Parameter Value
When you first open a feature template, for each parameter that has a default value, the scope is set to Default (a ), and the default setting or value is shown. To change the default or to enter a value, click the scope drop-down to the left of the parameter field and choose one of the following:
Parameter Name
Description
Device Specific
Use a device-specific value for the parameter. For device-specific parameters, you cannot enter a value in the feature template. You enter the value when you attach a device to a device template.
When you click Device Specific, the Enter Key box opens. This box displays a key, which is a unique string that identifies the parameter in a CSV file that you create. This file is an Excel spreadsheet that contains one column for each key. The header row contains the key names (one key per column), and each row after that corresponds to a device and defines the values of the keys for that device. Upload the CSV file when you attach a device to a device template.
To change the default key, type a new string and move the cursor out of the Enter Key box.
Examples of device-specific parameters are system IP address, hostname, GPS location, and site ID.
Global
Enter a value for the parameter, and apply that value to all devices.
Examples of parameters that you might apply globally to a group of devices are DNS server, syslog server, and interface MTUs.
Once you have created and named the template, enter the following values. Parameters marked with an asterisk are required.

Information About Disabling Weak SSH Encryption Algorithms on Cisco SD-WAN Manager
Cisco SD-WAN Manager provides an SSH client for communication with components in the network, including controllers and edge devices. The SSH client provides an encrypted connection for secure data transfer, based on a variety of encryption algorithms. Many organizations require stronger encryption than that provided by SHA-1, AES-128, and AES-192.
From Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1, you can disable the following weaker encryption algorithms so that an SSH client does not use these algorithms:
SHA-1
AES-128
AES-192
Before disabling these encryption algorithms, ensure that Cisco vEdge devices, if any, in the network, are using a software release later than Cisco SD-WAN Release 18.4.6.
