Product Overview
The Cisco Catalyst® 4948E and 4948E-F Ethernet Switches are the Cisco Catalyst 4900 Series data center switches built from the start to deliver best-in-class, full-featured server-access switching. The switches include identical features except that the Cisco Catalyst 4948E offers front-to-back cooling, and the Cisco Catalyst 4948E-F offers back-to-front cooling. Each switch offers forty-eight 10/100/1000-Gbps RJ45 downlink ports and four 1 and 10 Gigabit Ethernet uplink ports. The switches are designed to simplify data center architecture and operations by offering service provider-grade hardware and software in a one-rack-unit (1RU) form factor optimized for full-featured top-of-rack (ToR) data center deployments (Figure 1).
Figure 1.      Cisco Catalyst 4948E and 4948E-F Front Panel
The Cisco Catalyst 4948E and 4948E-F build on the advanced technology of the Cisco Catalyst 4948 Switches, the most widely deployed ToR switch in the industry, with more than 10 million ports deployed worldwide. The Cisco Catalyst 4948E and 4948E-F double the uplink bandwidth and offer true front-to-back and back-to-front airflow with no side or top venting. The airflow direction is controlled by the changing of fans. Optional front-to-back and back-to-front airflow management reduces data center operating costs by providing strict hot-aisle and cold-aisle isolation.
Hot-aisle and cold-aisle deployment remains the widely adopted best practice for data center cabinet layouts today. Networking switches and computing servers mounted in a single cabinet need to maintain the separation of the inlet cold air and the exhaust hot air for efficient use of cooling resources. The Cisco Catalyst 4948E and 4948E-F switches provide the option of front-to-back airflow (Cisco Catalyst 4948E) and back-to-front airflow (Cisco Catalyst 4948E-F) for ToR switch deployments.
Exceptional reliability and serviceability are delivered with optional internal AC and DC 1+1 hot-swappable power supplies and a hot-swappable fan tray with redundant fans (Figures 2 and 3).

●   Optimized forwarding across all four uplinks with equal-cost multipath (ECMP) load sharing
●   Improved resiliency with protection from attacks with access control lists (ACLs), Control Plane Policing (CoPP), Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) inspection, and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) snooping
●   Active queue management using dynamic buffer limiting (DBL) for increased security and network control
Cisco IOS Software
Cisco IOS Software is a proven network OS that offers best-in-class availability, manageability, and scalability.
The Cisco Catalyst 4948E and 4948E-F support three levels of Cisco IOS Software. The basic level is LAN Base, developed for deployments that require data center-class hardware along with Layer 2 switching but not advanced features such as routing and Cisco IOS EEM. The next level of software is IP Base; this level supports static routes, Routing Information Protocol (RIP) Versions and 2, and Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol Stub (EIGRP-Stub) for limited routing. The top level of software is Enterprise Services; this level adds support for advanced routing protocols such as Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) Protocol, and EIGRP. For a detailed list of supported software features, please refer to the software release notes at http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_23985.html.
Smart Top-of-Rack Design
Historically, data center design engineers have had to trade off access-layer features such as QoS, network visibility, and security when moving from an end-of-row (EoR) to a ToR data center design. The Cisco Catalyst 4948E and 4948E-F offer the same features found on large EoR data center switches in a 1RU form factor optimized for ToR deployments.
A few of the features specific to smart ToR switches are:
●   Server-rack-optimized switches with the option of front-to-back or back-to-front airflow
●   Nonblocking hardware-based switching and routing
●   Full support for access- and distribution-level Layer 3 routing
●   Advanced QoS including a modular QoS command-line interface (CLI)
●   Advanced security
●   Extended MAC address support for virtual environments
●   Network visibility (future support)
Data centers focused on the following applications should deploy smart ToR switches:
●   High-performance technical computing (grid)
●   Enterprise and service provider cloud
●   Virtual desktop environments
●   Network and server virtualized data centers
●   Web services
●   Enterprise IT
Cisco IOS Embedded Event Manager
Cisco IOS EEM is a unique subsystem within Cisco IOS Software that allows customers to create and asynchronously run scripts directly on a router or switch. Scripts can be programmed using a simple CLI. Cisco IOS EEM responds to real-time events to automate tasks or to take automatic action based on condition detection. Customers can also use Cisco IOS EEM to create custom commands to reduce deployment and management complexity. Scripts can enable simple to complex automated actions, such as entering a log item or changing a port configuration in response to a security threat.
Visit the open Cisco IOS EEM scripting community, Cisco Beyond, for sample Cisco IOS EEM scripts.
Optimized for Multimedia Applications
The Cisco Catalyst 4948E and 4948E-F are optimized for multimedia applications, with advanced multicast support. The switches support Protocol-Independent Multicast (PIM), Source-Specific Multicast (SSM), and Bidirectional PIM (bidir-PIM), providing end users with additional scalability to support multimedia applications. Also supported are Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) snooping and Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) snooping in hardware, enhancing performance and reducing network traffic by allowing a switch to dynamically add and remove hosts from a multicast group.
Intelligent Network Services with QoS and Sophisticated Traffic Management
The Cisco Catalyst 4948E and 4948E-F offer superior per-port QoS features to help ensure that network traffic is classified, prioritized, and scheduled optimally to efficiently manage bandwidth-intensive multimedia and time-sensitive and mission-critical applications. The Cisco Catalyst 4948E and 4948E-F can classify, monitor, and mark incoming packets, allowing the administrator to differentiate traffic flows and enforce policies. Sharing, shaping, and strict-priority configurations determine the scheduling of egress traffic. The Cisco Catalyst 4948E and 4948E-F also support DBL, a congestion-avoidance feature. For details about the QoS features, including active queue management through DBL on the Cisco Catalyst 4948E and 4948E-F, refer to the Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series Supervisor Engine QoS overview at http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/switches/ps5718/ps4324/prod_white_paper0900aecd8041691c.html.
