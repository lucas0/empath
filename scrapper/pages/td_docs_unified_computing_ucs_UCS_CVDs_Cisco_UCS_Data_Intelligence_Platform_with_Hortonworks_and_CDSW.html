Executive Summary
Data scientists are constantly searching for newer techniques and methodologies that can unlock the value of big data and distill this data further to identify additional insights which could transform productivity and provide business differentiation.
One such area is Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML), which has seen tremendous development with bringing in new frameworks and new forms of compute (CPU, GPU and FPGA) to work on data to provide key insights. While data lakes have historically been data intensive workloads, these advancements in technologies have led to a new growing demand of compute intensive workloads to operate on the same data.
While data scientists want to be able to use the latest and greatest advancements in AI/ML software and hardware technologies on their datasets, the IT team is also constantly looking at enabling these data scientists to be able to provide such a platform to a data lake. This has led to architecturally siloed implementations. When data, which is ingested, worked, and processed in a data lake, needs to be further operated by AI/ML frameworks, it often leaves the platform and has to be on-boarded to a different platform to be processed. This would be fine if this demand is seen only on a small percentage of workloads. However, AI/ML workloads working closely on the data in a data lake are seeing an increase in adoption. For instance, data lakes in customer environment are seeing deluge of data from new use cases such as IoT, autonomous driving, smart cities, genomics and financials, who are all seeing more and more demand of AI/ML processing of this data.
IT is demanding newer solutions to enable data scientists to operate on both a data lake and an AI/ML platform (or a compute farm) without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. IT also needs this to seamlessly grow to cloud scale while reducing the TCO of this infrastructure and without affecting utilization. Thus, driving a need to plan a data lake along with an AI/ML platform in a systemic fashion.
Seeing this increasing demand by IT, and also envisioning this as a natural extension of a data lake, we announced Cisco Data Intelligence Platform.  Cisco Data Intelligence Platform is discussed in detail here.
This CVD implements Cisco Data Intelligence Platform on Cisco Unified Computing System (Cisco UCS) using Hortonworks Data Platform 3.1.
Solution Overview
Cisco Data Intelligence Platform
Cisco Data Intelligence Platform (CDIP) is a cloud scale architecture which brings together big data, AI/compute farm, and storage tiers to work together as a single entity while also being able to scale independently to address the IT issues in the modern data center. This architecture allows for:
·         Extremely fast data ingest, and data engineering done at the data lake
·         AI compute farm allowing for different types of AI frameworks and compute types (GPU, CPU, FPGA) to work on this data for further analytics
·         A storage tier, allowing to gradually retire data which has been worked on to a storage dense system with a lower $/TB providing a better TCO
·         Seamlessly scale the architecture to thousands of nodes with a single pane of glass management using Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI)
Cisco Data Intelligence Platform caters to the evolving architecture bringing together a fully scalable infrastructure with centralized management and fully supported software stack (in partnership with industry leaders in the space) to each of these three independently scalable components of the architecture including data lake, AI/ML and Object stores.
Cisco has developed numerous industry leading Cisco Validated Designs (CVDs) in the area of Big Data (CVDs with Cloudera, Hortonworks, and MapR), compute farm with Kubernetes (CVD with RedHat OpenShift) and Object store (Scality, SwiftStack, Cloudian, and others).
This Cisco Data Intelligence Platform can be deployed in two variants:
·         CDIP with Cloudera with Data Science Workbench (powered by Kubernetes) and Tiered Storage with Hadoop
·         CDIP with Hortonworks with Apache Hadoop 3.1 and Data Science Workbench (powered by Kubernetes) and Tiered Storage with Hadoop
Figure 1  Cisco Data Intelligence Platform with Hadoop, Kubernetes, and Object Store
This architecture can start from a single rack and scale to thousands of nodes with a single pane of glass management with Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI).

  Figure 3 illustrates a 12-node starter cluster with all the 3 components in a single rack. The top 8 nodes has Cisco UCS C240 M5 servers as a data lake. Each link in the figure represents a 40 Gigabit Ethernet link from each of the 12 servers directly connected to a Fabric Interconnect. The second 2 x Cisco UCS C480 ML M5 Servers and the last 4 servers illustrate a data tiering on 2xS3260 servers. Every server is connected to both Fabric Interconnects.
Figure 3  Topology
As illustrated in Figure 4, a 30-node starter cluster. Rack #1 has sixteen Cisco UCS C240 M5 servers. Each link in the figure represents a 40 Gigabit Ethernet link from each of the sixteen servers directly connected to a Fabric Interconnect. Rack #2 has six Cisco UCS C240 M5 and four Cisco UCS S3260 servers. Every server is connected to both Fabric Interconnects.
Figure 4  Cisco Data Intelligence Platform - 30 Node Configuration with Cloudera CDH 6.2 and CDSW 1.5
  Figure 4 shows an alternate configuration for cases where more GPU capacity is needed. Four of the Cisco UCS C240 M5 servers from the previous configuraton in Figure 3 are replaced with Cisco UCS C480 M5 ML M5 server which support up to eight V100 MXM GPUs.
          Each Cisco UCS C480 ML M5 has 8 x NVIDIA SXM2 V100 32GB modules with NVLink interconnect. Each Cisco UCS C240 M5 supports up to two PCIe GPU adapters with NVIDIA Tesla V100. For more information about Cisco UCS C240 M5 Sever installation and GPU card configuration rules, go to https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/c/hw/C240M5/install/C240M5/C240M5_appendix_0101.html
            Power requirements per rack must be calculated since the exact values will change based on the power needs of the GPUs.
Scaling the Solution
Figure 5 illustrates how to scale the solution. Each pair of Cisco UCS 6332 Fabric Interconnects has 28 Cisco UCS C240 M5 servers connected to it. This allows for four uplinks from each Fabric Interconnect to the Cisco Nexus 9332 switch. Six pairs of 6332 FI’s can connect to a single switch with four uplink ports each. With 28 servers per FI, a total of 168 servers can be supported. Additionally, the can scale to thousands of nodes with the Nexus 9500 series family of switches.
Figure 5  Scaling the Solution
In the reference architectures discussed in this document, each of the components is scaled separately, and for the purposes of this example, scaling is uniform. Two scale scenarios are discussed here:
·         Scaled architecture with 3:1 oversubscription with Cisco fabric interconnects and Cisco ACI
·         Scaled architecture with 2:1 oversubscription with Cisco ACI
In the following scenarios, the goal is to populate up to a maximum of 200 leaf nodes in a Cisco ACI domain. Not all cases reach that number because they use the Cisco Nexus® 9508 Switch for this sizing and not the Cisco Nexus 9516 Switch.
Scaled Architecture with 3:1 Oversubscription with Cisco Fabric Interconnects and Cisco ACI
The architecture discussed in this document and shown in Figure 6 supports 3:1 network oversubscription from every node to every other node across a multidomain cluster (nodes in a single domain within a pair of Cisco fabric interconnects are locally switched and not oversubscribed).
From the viewpoint of the data lake, 24 Cisco UCS C240 M5 Rack Servers are connected to a pair of Cisco UCS 6332 Fabric Interconnects (with 32 x 40-Gbps throughput). From each fabric interconnect, 8 x 40-Gbps links connect to a pair of Cisco Nexus 9336 Switches. Two pairs of fabric interconnects can connect to a single pair of Cisco Nexus 9336 Switches (8 x 2 40-Gbps links). Each of these Cisco Nexus 9336 Switches connects to a pair of Cisco Nexus 9508 Cisco ACI switches with 6 x 100-Gbps uplinks (connecting to a Cisco N9K-X9736C-FX line card).
Figure 6  Scaled Architecture with 3:1 Oversubscription with Cisco Fabric Interconnects and Cisco ACI
Scaled Architecture with 2:1 Oversubscription with Cisco ACI
In the scenario discussed here and shown in Figure 7, the Cisco Nexus 9508 Switch with the Cisco N9K-X9736C-FX line card can support up to 36 x 100-Gbps ports, each and 8 such line cards.
For the 2:1 oversubscription, 30 Cisco UCS C240 M5 Rack Servers are connected to a pair of Cisco Nexus 9336 Switches, and each Cisco Nexus 9336 connects to a pair of Cisco Nexus 9508 Switches with three uplinks each. A pair of Cisco Nexus 9336 Switches can support 30 servers and connect to a spine with 6 x 100-Gbps links on each spine. This single pod (pair of Cisco Nexus 9336 Switches connecting to 30 Cisco UCS C240 M5 servers and 6 uplinks to each spine) can be repeated 48 times (288/6) for a given Cisco Nexus 9508 Switch and can support up to1440 servers.
To reduce the oversubscription ratio (to get 1:1 network subscription from any node to any node), you can use just 15 servers under a pair of Cisco Nexus 9336 Switches and then move to Cisco Nexus 9516 Switches (the number of leaf nodes would double).
To scale beyond this number, multiple spines can be aggregated.

Technology Overview
Cisco UCS Integrated Infrastructure for Big Data and Analytics
The Cisco UCS Integrated Infrastructure for Big Data and Analytics solution for Hortonworks Data Platform on Cisco UCS Integrated Infrastructure for Big Data and Analytics, is a highly scalable architecture designed to meet a variety of scale-out application demands with seamless data integration and management integration capabilities built using the components described in this section.
Cisco Unified Computing System
Cisco Unified Computing System (Cisco UCS) is a next-generation solution for blade and rack server computing. Cisco UCS integrates a low-latency; lossless 10 and 40 Gigabit Ethernet unified network fabric with enterprise-class, x86-architecture servers. Cisco UCS is an integrated, scalable, multi-chassis platform in which all resources participate in a unified management domain. Cisco UCS accelerates the delivery of new services simply, reliably, and securely through end-to-end provisioning and migration support for both virtualized and non-virtualized systems. Cisco UCS fuses access layer networking and servers. This high-performance, next-generation server system provides a data center with a high degree of workload agility and scalability.
Cisco UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects
Cisco UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects provide high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity for servers, with integrated, unified management provided for all connected devices by Cisco UCS Manager (UCSM). Deployed in redundant pairs, Cisco fabric interconnects offer the full active-active redundancy, performance, and exceptional scalability needed to support the large number of nodes that are typical in clusters serving big data applications. Cisco UCS Manager enables rapid and consistent server configuration using service profiles, automating ongoing system maintenance activities such as firmware updates across the entire cluster as a single operation. Cisco UCS Manager also offers advanced monitoring with options to raise alarms and send notifications about the health of the entire cluster.
The Cisco UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects are a core part of Cisco UCS, providing low-latency, lossless 10 and 40 Gigabit Ethernet, Fiber Channel over Ethernet (FCoE), and Fiber Channel functions with management capabilities for the entire system. All servers attached to Fabric interconnects become part of a single, highly available management domain.

Cisco UCS C-Series Rack-Mount Servers
Cisco UCS C-Series Rack-Mount Servers keep pace with Intel Xeon processor innovation by offering the latest processors with increased processor frequency and improved security and availability features. With the increased performance provided by the Intel Xeon Scalable Family Processors, Cisco UCS C-Series servers offer an improved price-to-performance ratio. They also extend Cisco UCS innovations to an industry-standard rack-mount form factor, including a standards-based unified network fabric, Cisco VN-Link virtualization support, and Cisco Extended Memory Technology.
It is designed to operate both in standalone environments and as part of Cisco UCS managed configuration, these servers enable organizations to deploy systems incrementally—using as many or as few servers as needed—on a schedule that best meets the organization’s timing and budget. Cisco UCS C-Series servers offer investment protection through the capability to deploy them either as standalone servers or as part of Cisco UCS. One compelling reason that many organizations prefer rack-mount servers is the wide range of I/O options available in the form of PCIe adapters. Cisco UCS C-Series servers support a broad range of I/O options, including interfaces supported by Cisco and adapters from third parties.
Cisco UCS C240 M5 Rack-Mount Server
The Cisco UCS C240 M5 Rack-Mount Server (Figure 9) is a 2-socket, 2-Rack-Unit (2RU) rack server offering industry-leading performance and expandability. It supports a wide range of storage and I/O-intensive infrastructure workloads, from big data and analytics to collaboration. Cisco UCS C-Series Rack Servers can be deployed as standalone servers or as part of a Cisco Unified Computing System managed environment to take advantage of Cisco’s standards-based unified computing innovations that help reduce customers’ Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and increase their business agility.
In response to ever-increasing computing and data-intensive real-time workloads, the enterprise-class Cisco UCS C240 M5 server extends the capabilities of the Cisco UCS portfolio in a 2RU form factor.

NVIDIA GPU
Graphics Processing Units or GPUs are specialized processors designed to render images, animation and video for computer displays. They perform this task by running many operations simultaneously. While the number and kinds of operations they can do are limited, they make up for it by being able run many thousands in parallel. As the graphics capabilities of GPUs increased, it soon became apparent that the massive parallelism of GPUs could be put to other uses beside rendering graphics.
NVIDIA GPU used in this document, NVIDIA Tesla V100, is advanced data center GPU built to accelerate AI, HPC, and graphics. It is powered by NVIDIA Volta architecture, comes in 16 and 32 GB configurations.
NVIDIA GPUs bring two key advantages to the table. First, they make possible solutions that were simply not computationally possible before. Second, by providing the same processing power as scores of traditional CPUs they reduce the requirements for rack space, power, networking and cooling in the data center.
NVIDIA CUDA
GPUs are very good at running the same operation on different data simultaneously. This is often referred to as single instruction, multiple data, or SIMD. This is exactly what’s needed to render graphics but many other computing problems can benefit from this approach. As a result, NVIDIA created CUDA. CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model that makes it possible to use a GPU for many general-purpose computing tasks via commonly used programming languages like C and C++.
In addition to the general-purpose computing capabilities that CUDA enables there is also a special CUDA library for deep learning called the CUDA Deep Neural Network library, or cuDNN. cuDNN makes it easier to implement deep machine learning architectures that take full advantage of the GPU’s capabilities.

Figure 16           Cloudera Data Hub
Cloudera provides a scalable, flexible, integrated platform that makes it easy to manage rapidly increasing volumes and varieties of data in any enterprise. Industry-leading Cloudera products and solutions enable to deploy and manage Apache Hadoop and related projects, manipulate and analyze data, and keep that data secure and protected.
Cloudera provides the following products and tools:
·         CDH—The Cloudera distribution of Apache Hadoop and other related open-source projects, including Spark. CDH also provides security and integration with numerous hardware and software solutions.

Cloudera Data Science Workbench
Cloudera Data Science Workbench (CDSW) is a web application that allows data scientists to use a variety of open source languages and libraries to directly and securely access the data in the Hadoop cluster. Direct access to the big data cluster means no more working with small subsets of the data on desktop systems; no sampling is required as the entire data set is available for use directly by the user. Further, users are not restricted to a single environment. Many popular open source libraries and languages are supported, including R, Python and Scala, as well as all of the ML/DL frameworks such as TensorFlow, Theano, PyTorch, and so on. Additionally, CDSW enables access to available GPU resources for deep learning workloads which means users become productive faster with no need for retraining and no time lost learning a new programming language.
CDSW is addressing the key challenge that every team or user may require a different language, library or framework in order to be productive while the organization requires reproducibility and collaboration. By making the entire set of data in the cluster available to the user, CSDW eliminates the problem that what works on small samples or extracts of the data on a user’s desktop computer may not scale across a large cluster. Cloudera Data Science Workbench gives data scientists the flexibility and simplicity they need to be productive and innovative at scale.
Additionally, CDSW enables seamless access to high-performance processors in the form of GPUs. CSDW makes use of lightweight container architecture to rapidly and securely provide the environment and resources to the users.
Cloudera Data Science Workbench is directly aimed at helping data scientists build and test new analyses and analytics projects as quickly as possible in secure manner even in large scale environments. This flexibility improves the efficiency of the exploration process, a key requirement to meet in order to move rapidly from idea to answer. Most analytics problems, especially those with transformative power, are not standard analyses and require advanced models and iterative methods. Experimentation and innovation are the heart and soul of data science, but security is needed for compliance and governance.
Data has become one of the most strategic assets in the organization. Leveraging the data to drive the business forward is the primary motivation for building an enterprise data hub to support advanced analytics. Typically, when forced to make a choice between the security of the data and the flexibility to access it, security wins locking away the data from the people who most need it. CDSW address this issue by providing full authentication and access controls against data in the cluster, including complete Kerberos integration. It offers data science teams per-project isolation and reproducibility with no effort.
Cloudera Data Science Workbench allows you to automate analytics workloads with a built-in job and pipeline scheduling system that supports real-time monitoring, job history, and email alerts. Jobs are created and can be configured to run on a recurring schedule, as well as providing alerts for successful and failed runs. Multiple jobs can be scheduled together to create an automated pipeline; for example, the first job performs data acquisition, the next data cleansing, then analytics, and so on.
Collaboration and sharing of results are implemented via project sharing (either globally or to specific users, and project forking. To share results, CSDW enables publishing output for viewing via a browser, and even makes the console log itself available for viewing both during and after the run. Cloudera Data Science Workbench is a web application. It has no desktop footprint making it very easy to administer and maintain.
Data Science Workbench provides the following features:
·         CPU and GPU as a resource: Data Science Workbench provides basic support for the use of existing general-purpose CPUs for each stage of the workflow and, optionally, accelerates the math-intensive steps with the selective application of special-purpose GPUs all through a Docker container, with Kubernetes scheduling these resources in the back end.
·         Self-service portal: The Data Science Workbench web user interface console provides a self-service portal for data scientists to create an environment for their workloads (Figure 17). Currently, R, Python, and Scala are supported.
·         Jupyter Notebook: Most data scientists use Jupyter Notebooks for AI/ML analysis and development. Data Science Workbench provides a Jupyter Notebook environment when data scientists create a portal, and these notebooks can be shared or worked in a collaborative manner.

·         Highly Extensible and Customizable. Fit Hadoop seamlessly into your enterprise environment. Highly extensible with Ambari Stacks for bringing custom services under management, and with Ambari Views for customizing the Ambari Web UI.
HDP for Data Access
With YARN at its foundation, HDP provides a range of processing engines that allow users to interact with data in multiple and parallel ways, without the need to stand up individual clusters for each data set/application. Some applications require batch while others require interactive SQL or low-latency access with NoSQL. Other applications require search, streaming or in-memory analytics. Apache Solr, Storm and Spark fulfill those needs respectively.
To function as a true data platform, the YARN-based architecture of HDP enables the widest possible range of access methods to coexist within the same cluster avoiding unnecessary and costly data silos.
As shown in Figure 18, HDP Enterprise natively provides for the following data access types:
·         Batch – Apache MapReduce has served as the default Hadoop processing engine for years. It is tested and relied upon by many existing applications.
·         Interactive SQL Query - Apache Hive is the de facto standard for SQL interactions at petabyte scale within Hadoop. Hive delivers interactive and batch SQL querying across the broadest set of SQL semantics.
·         Search - HDP integrates Apache Solr to provide high-speed indexing and sub-second search times across all your HDFS data.
·         Scripting - Apache Pig is a scripting language for Hadoop that can run on MapReduce or Apache Tez, allowing you to aggregate, join and sort data.
·         Low-latency access via NoSQL - Apache HBase provides extremely fast access to data as a columnar format, NoSQL database. Apache Accumulo also provides high-performance storage and retrieval, but with fine-grained access control to the data.
·         Streaming - Apache Storm processes streams of data in real time and can analyze and take action on data as it flows into HDFS.
Figure 18           YARN
Submarine
Deep learning is useful for enterprises tasks in the field of speech recognition, image classification, AI chatbots, machine translation, just to name a few. In order to train deep learning/machine learning models, frameworks such as TensorFlow / MXNet / PyTorch / Caffe / XGBoost can be leveraged. And sometimes these frameworks are used together to solve different problems.
To make distributed deep learning/machine learning applications easily launched, managed and monitored, Hadoop community initiated the Submarine project along with other improvements such as first-class GPU support, Docker container support, container-DNS support, scheduling improvements, and so on.
These improvements make distributed deep learning/machine learning applications run on Apache Hadoop YARN as simple as running it locally, which can let machine-learning engineers focus on algorithms instead of worrying about underlying infrastructure. By upgrading to latest Hadoop, users can now run deep learning workloads with other ETL/streaming jobs running on the same cluster. This can achieve easy access to data on the same cluster and achieve better resource utilization.
Figure 19           Submarine Workflow
Docker Containerization
Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP 3.0) makes use of container technology. Containers are conceptually similar to virtual machines, but instead of virtualizing the hardware, a container virtualizes the operating system. With a VM there is an entire operating system sitting on top of the hypervisor. Containers dispense with this time-consuming and resource hungry requirement by sharing the host system’s kernel. As a result, a container is far smaller, and its lightweight nature means they can be instantiated quickly. In fact, they can be instantiated so quickly that new application architectures are possible.
Docker is an open-source project that performs operating-system-level virtualization, also known as "containerization." It uses Linux kernel features like namespaces and control groups to create containers. These features are not new, but Docker has taken these concepts and improved them in the following ways:
·         Ease of use: Docker makes easier for anyone — developers, systems admins, architects and others — to take advantage of containers in order to quickly build and test portable applications. It allows anyone to package an application on their development system, which can then run unmodified on any cloud or bare metal server. The basic idea is to create a “build once, run anywhere” system.
·         Speed: Docker containers are very fast with a small footprint. Ultimately, containers are just sandboxed environments running on the kernel, so they take up few resources. You can create and run a Docker container in seconds. Compare this to a VM which takes much longer because it has to boot up a full virtual operating system every time.
·         Modularity: Docker makes it easy to take an application and breaks its functionality into separate individual containers. These containers can then be spun up and run as needed. This is particularly useful for cases where an application needs to hold and lock a particular resource, like a GPU, and then release it once it’s done using it. Modularity also enables each component, i.e., container to be updated independently.
·         Scalability: modularity enables scalability. With different parts of the system running in different containers it becomes possible, and with Docker, it becomes easy to connect these containers together to create an application, which can then be scaled out as needed.
YARN Support For Docker
Containerization provides YARN support for Docker containers, which makes it easier to bundle libraries and dependencies along with their application, allowing third-party applications to run on Apache Hadoop (for example, containerized applications), enabling:
·         Faster time to deployment by enabling third-party apps.
·         The ability to run multiple versions of an application, enabling users to rapidly create features by developing and testing new versions of services without disrupting old ones.
·         Improved resource utilization and increased task throughput for containers, yielding faster time to market for services.
·         Orchestration of stateless distributed applications.
·         Packaging libraries for Spark application, eliminating the need for operations to deploy those libraries cluster wide.
Figure 20          Containerized Application on Apache Hadoop YARN 3.1
As shown in Figure 20, YARN Services Framework in addition with Docker containerization, it is now possible to run both existing Hadoop frameworks, such as Hive, Spark, etc., and new containerized workloads on the same underlying infrastructure. Apache Hadoop 3.1 further improved these capabilities to enable advanced use cases such as TensorFlow and HBase.
NVIDIA Docker
Docker containers are platform-agnostic, but also hardware-agnostic. This presents a problem when using specialized hardware such as NVIDIA GPUs which require kernel modules and user-level libraries to operate.  As a result, Docker does not natively support NVIDIA GPUs within containers.
One of the early workarounds to this problem was to fully install the NVIDIA drivers inside the container and map in the character devices corresponding to the NVIDIA GPUs (for example, /dev/nvidia0) on launch. This solution is brittle because the version of the host driver must exactly match the version of the driver installed in the container. This requirement drastically reduced the portability of these early containers, undermining one of Docker’s more important features.
To enable portability in Docker images that leverage NVIDIA GPUs, NVIDIA developed nvidia-docker, an open-source project hosted on GitHub that provides the two critical components needed for portable GPU-based containers:
·         driver-agnostic CUDA images; and a Docker command line wrapper that mounts the user mode components of the driver and the GPUs (character devices) into the container at launch.
·         nvidia-docker is essentially a wrapper around the docker command that transparently provisions a container with the necessary components to execute code on the GPU.
          As of the publishing of this CVD, Hortonworks only supports nvidia-docker version 1.
GPU Pooling and Isolation
GPU pooling and isolation allows GPU to be a first-class resource type in Hadoop, making it easier for customers to run machine learning and deep learning workloads.
·         Compute-intensive analytics require not only a large compute pool, but also a fast and expensive processing pool with GPUs in tandem
·         Customers can share cluster-wide GPU resources without having to dedicate a GPU node to a single tenant or workload
·         GPU isolation dedicates a GPU to an application so that no other application has access to that GPU
When it comes to resource scheduling, it is important to recognize GPU as a resource. YARN extends the resource model to more flexible mode which makes it easier to add new countable resource-types. When GPU is added as resource type, YARN can schedule applications on GPU machines. Furthermore, by specifying the number of requested GPU to containers, YARN can find machines with available GPUs to satisfy container requests.
          When GPU scheduling is enabled, YARN can schedule non-GPU applications such as LLAP, Tez, and etc. to servers without GPU. Moreover, YARN can allocate GPU applications such as TensorFlow, Caffe, MXNet, and so on, to servers with GPU.
Red Hat Ansible Automation
Red Hat Ansible Automation is a powerful IT automation tool. It is capable of provisioning numerous types of resources and deploying applications. It can configure and manage devices and operating system components. Due to its simplicity, extensibility, and portability, this solution extensively utilizes Ansible for performing repetitive deployment steps across the nodes.

          Multi-homing configuration is not recommended in this design, so please assign only one network interface on each host.
            For simplicity outbound NATing is configured for internet access when desired such as accessing public repos and/or accessing Red Hat Content Delivery Network. However, configuring outbound NAT is beyond the scope of this document.
Post OS Install Configuration
Choose one of the nodes of the cluster or a separate node as the Admin Node for management such as HDP installation, Ansible, creating a local Red Hat repo and so on. In this document, rhel1 has been used for this purpose.
Configure /etc/hosts
Setup /etc/hosts on the Admin node; this is a pre-configuration to setup DNS as shown in the next section.
          For the purpose of simplicity, /etc/hosts file is configured with hostnames in all the nodes. However, in large scale production grade deployment, DNS server setup is highly recommended. Furthermore, /etc/hosts file is not copied into containers running on the platform.
Below are the sample A records for DNS configuration within Linux environment.
$ORIGIN hdp3.cisco.com.

rhel28  A 10.16.1.59
To create the host file on the admin node, follow these steps:
1.        Log into the Admin Node (rhel1).
#ssh 10.16.1.31
2.       Populate the host file with IP addresses and corresponding hostnames on the Admin node (rhel1) and other nodes as follows:
3.        On Admin Node (rhel1):
# cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6

Set Up the Passwordless Login
To manage all of the cluster nodes from the admin node password-less login needs to be setup. It assists in automating common tasks with Ansible, and shell-scripts without having to use passwords.
To enable a passwordless login across all the nodes when Red Hat Linux is installed across all the nodes in the cluster, follow these steps:
1.        Log into the Admin Node (rhel1).
#ssh 10.13.1.31
2.       Run the ssh-keygen command to create both public and private keys on the admin node.
# ssh-keygen -N '' -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Figure 33           ssh-keygen
3.        Run the following command from the admin node to copy the public key id_rsa.pub to all the nodes of the cluster.  ssh-copy-id appends the keys to the remote-host’s  .ssh/authorized_keys.
# for i in {1..17}; do    echo "copying rhel$i.hdp3.cisco.com"; ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@rhel$i.hdp3.cisco.com; done;
4.       Enter yes for Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
5.        Enter the password of the remote host.
Create the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.6 Local Repository
To create the repository using RHEL DVD or ISO on the admin node (in this deployment rhel1 is used for this purpose), create a directory with all the required RPMs, run the createrepo command and then publish the resulting repository.
1.        Log into rhel1. Create a directory that would contain the repository.
   # mkdir -p /var/www/html/rhelrepo
Copy the contents of the Red Hat DVD to /var/www/html/rhelrepo
2.       Alternatively, if you have access to a Red Hat ISO Image, Copy the ISO file to rhel1.
Log back into rhel1 and create the mount directory.
# scp rhel-server-7.6-x86_64-dvd.iso rhel1:/root/
  # mkdir -p /mnt/rheliso
# mount -t iso9660 -o loop /root/rhel-server-7.6-x86_64-dvd.iso /mnt/rheliso/
Copy the contents of the ISO to the /var/www/html/rhelrepo directory:
# cp -r /mnt/rheliso/* /var/www/html/rhelrepo
3.        On rhel1 create a .repo file to enable the use of the yum command:
# vi /var/www/html/rhelrepo/rheliso.repo
[rhel7.6]
name=Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6
baseurl=http://10.16.1.31/rhelrepo
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1
4.       Copy rheliso.repo file from /var/www/html/rhelrepo  to /etc/yum.repos.d on rhel1:
# cp /var/www/html/rhelrepo/rheliso.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/
          Based on this repo file yum requires httpd to be running on rhel1 for other nodes to access the repository.
To make use of repository files on rhel1 without httpd, edit the baseurl of repo file /etc/yum.repos.d/rheliso.repo to point repository location in the file system.
          This step is needed to install software on Admin Node (rhel1) using the repo (such as httpd, create-repo, and so on.)
# vi /etc/yum.repos.d/rheliso.repo
[rhel7.6]
name=Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6
baseurl=file:///var/www/html/rhelrepo
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1
Create the Red Hat Repository Database
To create the Red Hat repository database, follow these steps:
1.        Install the createrepo package on admin node (rhel1). Use it to regenerate the repository database(s) for the local copy of the RHEL DVD contents:
# yum -y install createrepo
2.       Run createrepo on the RHEL repository to create the repo database on admin node:
# cd /var/www/html/rhelrepo
# createrepo .
Figure 34           createrepo
  Set Up Ansible
To set up Ansible, follow these steps:
1.        Download Ansible rpm from the following link:
https://releases.ansible.com/ansible/rpm/release/epel-7-x86_64/ansible-2.4.6.0-1.el7.ans.noarch.rpm
# wget https://releases.ansible.com/ansible/rpm/release/epel-7-x86_64/ansible-2.4.6.0-1.el7.ans.noarch.rpm
          For more information about to download and install Ansible engine, please follow the link https://access.redhat.com/articles/3174981
2.       Run the following command to install ansible:
# yum localinstall -y ansible-2.4.6.0-1.el7.ans.noarch.rpm
3.        Verify Ansible installation by running the following commands:
# ansible –version
# ansible localhost -m ping
 [WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available. Note that the implicit localhost does not match 'all'
  localhost | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "failed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
  4.       Prepare the host inventory file for Ansible as shown below. Various host groups have been created based on any specific installation requirements of certain hosts:
[root@rhel1 ~]# cat /etc/ansible/hosts

# ansible gpunodes -m ping
Figure 35           Ansible – Ping Hosts
Install httpd
Setting up the RHEL repository on the admin node requires httpd. To set up RHEL repository on the admin node, follow these steps:
1.        Install httpd on the admin node to host repositories:
          The Red Hat repository is hosted using HTTP on the admin node; this machine is accessible by all the hosts in the cluster.
# yum –y install httpd
2.       Add ServerName and make the necessary changes to the server configuration file:
   # vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
    ServerName 10.16.1.31:80
3.        Start httpd:
# service httpd start
# chkconfig httpd on
Set Up All Nodes to Use the RHEL Repository
To set up all noes to use the RHEL repository, follow these steps:
          Based on this repository file, yum requires httpd to be running on rhel1 for other nodes to access the repository.
1.        Copy the rheliso.repo to all the nodes of the cluster:
# ansible nodes -m copy -a “src=/var/www/html/rhelrepo/rheliso.repo dest=/etc/yum.repos.d/.”
2.       Copy the /etc/hosts file to all nodes:
# ansible nodes -m copy -a “src=/etc/hosts dest=/etc/hosts”
3.        Purge the yum caches:
# ansible nodes -a “yum clean all”
# ansible nodes -a “yum repolist”
          While suggested configuration is to disable SELinux as shown below, if for any reason SELinux needs to be enabled on the cluster, then ensure to run the following to make sure that the httpd is able to read the Yum repofiles.
  #chcon -R -t httpd_sys_content_t /var/www/html/
Upgrade the Cisco Network Driver for VIC1387
The latest Cisco Network driver is required for performance and updates. The latest drivers can be downloaded from the link below:
https://software.cisco.com/download/home/283862063/type/283853158/release/4.0.2
1.        In the ISO image, the required driver kmod-enic-…..rpm can be located at  Network\Cisco\VIC\RHEL\RHEL7.6.
2.       From a node connected to the Internet, download, extract and transfer kmod-enic-.rpm to rhel1 (admin node).
3.        Copy the rpm on all nodes of the cluster using the following Ansible commands. For this example, the rpm is assumed to be in present working directory of rhel1:
[root@rhel1 ~]# ansible all -m copy -a "src=/root/kmod-enic-3.2.210.22-738.18.rhel7u6.x86_64.rpm dest=/root/."
4.       Use the yum module to install the enic driver rpm file on all the nodes through Ansible:
[root@rhel1 ~]# ansible all –m yum –a “name=/root/kmod-enic-3.2.210.22-738.18.rhel7u6.x86_64.rpm state=present”
Make sure that the above installed version of kmod-enic driver is being used on all nodes by running the command "modinfo enic" on all nodes:
[root@rhel1 ~]# ansible all -m command -a “modinfo enic”
5.        It is recommended to download the kmod-megaraid driver for higher performance. The RPM can be found in the same package at: \Linux\Storage\LSI\Cisco_Storage_12G_SAS_RAID_controller\RHEL\RHEL7.6
Install xfsprogs
From the admin node rhel1 run the command shown below to Install  xfsprogs on all the nodes for xfs filesystem:
# ansible all -m yum -a “name=xfsprogs state=present”
Set Up JAVA
To setup JAVA, follow these steps:
          HDP 3.1.0 requires JAVA 8.
1.        Download jdk-7u76-linux-x64.rpm and src the rpm to admin node (rhel1) from the link  (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html )
2.       Copy JDK rpm to all nodes:
# ansible nodes -m copy -a "src=/root/jdk-8u201-linux-x64.rpm dest=/root/."
3.        Extract and Install JDK on all nodes:
# ansible all -m command -a "rpm -ivh jdk-8u201-linux-x64.rpm"
  4.       Create the following files java-set-alternatives.sh and java-home.sh on admin node (rhel1):
vi java-set-alternatives.sh
#!/bin/bash
for item in java javac javaws jar jps javah javap jcontrol jconsole jdb; do
 rm -f /var/lib/alternatives/$item
 alternatives --install /usr/bin/$item $item /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_181-amd64/bin/$item 9
 alternatives --set $item /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_181-amd64/bin/$item
done
  vi java-home.sh
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_181-amd64
  5.        Make the two java scripts created above executable:
chmod 755 ./java-set-alternatives.sh ./java-home.sh
6.       Copying java-set-alternatives.sh to all nodes.
ansible nodes -m copy -a “src=/root/java-set-alternatives.sh dest=/root/.”
ansible nodes -m file -a "dest=/root/java-set-alternatives.sh mode=755"
ansible nodes -m copy -a “src=/root/java-home.sh dest=/root/.”
ansible nodes -m file -a "dest=/root/java-home.sh mode=755"
  7.        Setup Java Alternatives
[root@rhel1 ~]# ansible all -m shell -a "/root/java-set-alternatives.sh"
8.       Make sure correct java is setup on all nodes (should point to newly installed java path):
# ansible all -m shell -a "alternatives --display java | head -2"
9.       Setup JAVA_HOME on all nodes:
# ansible all -m shell -a "source /root/java-home.sh"
10.    Display JAVA_HOME on all nodes:
# ansible all -m command -a "echo $JAVA_HOME"
11.     Display current java –version:
# ansible all -m command -a "java -version"
  Configure NTP
The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize the time of all the nodes within the cluster. The Network Time Protocol daemon (ntpd) sets and maintains the system time of day in synchronism with the timeserver located in the admin node (rhel1). Configuring NTP is critical for any Hadoop Cluster. If server clocks in the cluster drift out of sync, serious problems will occur with HBase and other services.
# ansible all -m yum -a “name=ntp state=present”
          Installing an internal NTP server keeps your cluster synchronized even when an outside NTP server is inaccessible.
1.        Configure /etc/ntp.conf on the admin node only with the following contents:
# vi /etc/ntp.conf
driftfile /var/lib/ntp/drift
restrict 127.0.0.1
restrict -6 ::1
server 127.127.1.0
fudge 127.127.1.0 stratum 10
includefile /etc/ntp/crypto/pw
keys /etc/ntp/keys
2.       Create /root/ntp.conf on the admin node and copy it to all nodes:
# vi /root/ntp.conf
server 10.16.1.31
driftfile /var/lib/ntp/drift
restrict 127.0.0.1
restrict -6 ::1
includefile /etc/ntp/crypto/pw
keys /etc/ntp/keys
3.        Copy ntp.conf file from the admin node to /etc of all the nodes by executing the following commands in the admin node (rhel1):
# ansible nodes -m copy -a “src=/root/ntp.conf dest=/etc/ntp.conf”
4.       Run the following to syncronize the time and restart NTP daemon on all nodes:
# ansible all -m service -a “name=ntpd state=stopped”
# ansible all -m command -a “ntpdate rhel1.hdp3.cisco.com”
# ansible all -m service -a “name=ntpd state=started”
  5.        Make sure to restart of NTP daemon across reboots:
# ansible all -a  "systemctl enable ntpd"
6.       Verify NTP is up and running in all nodes by running the following commands:
# ansible all -a “systemctl status ntpd”
            Alternatively, the new Chrony service can be installed, that is quicker to synchronize clocks in mobile and virtual systems.
7.        Install the Chrony service:
# ansible all -m yum -a “name=chrony state=present”
8.       Activate the Chrony service at boot:
# ansible all -a “systemctl enable chronyd”
9.       Start the Chrony service:
# ansible all -m service -a “name=chronyd state=started”systemctl start chronyd
The Chrony configuration is in the /etc/chrony.conf file, configured similar to /etc/ntp.conf.
Enable Syslog
Syslog must be enabled on each node to preserve logs regarding killed processes or failed jobs. Modern versions such as syslog-ng and rsyslog are possible, making it more difficult to be sure that a syslog daemon is present.
One of the following commands should suffice to confirm that the service is properly configured:
# ansible all -m command -a “rsyslogd –v”
# ansible all -m command -a “service rsyslog status”
Set ulimit
On each node, ulimit -n specifies the number of inodes that can be opened simultaneously. With the default value of 1024, the system appears to be out of disk space and shows no inodes available. This value should be set to 64000 on every node.
Higher values are unlikely to result in an appreciable performance gain.
To set ulimit, follow these steps:
1.        For setting the ulimit on Redhat, edit  /etc/security/limits.conf on admin node rhel1 and add the following lines:
root soft nofile 64000
root hard nofile 64000
2.       Copy the /etc/security/limits.conf file from admin node (rhel1) to all the nodes using the following command:
# ansible nodes -m copy -a “src=/etc/security/limits.conf dest=/etc/security/limits.conf”
3.        Make sure that the /etc/pam.d/su file contains the following settings:
#%PAM-1.0
auth            sufficient      pam_rootOK.so
# Uncomment the following line to implicitly trust users in the "wheel" group.
#auth           sufficient      pam_wheel.so trust use_uid
# Uncomment the following line to require a user to be in the "wheel" group.
#auth           required        pam_wheel.so use_uid
auth            include         system-auth
account         sufficient      pam_succeed_if.so uid = 0 use_uid quiet
account         include         system-auth
password        include         system-auth
session         include         system-auth
session         optional        pam_xauth.so
          The ulimit values are applied on a new shell, running the command on a node on an earlier instance of a shell will show old values.
Disable SELinux
SELinux must be disabled during the install procedure and cluster setup. SELinux can be enabled after installation and while the cluster is running.
SELinux can be disabled by editing /etc/selinux/config and changing the SELINUX line to SELINUX=disabled.
To disable SELinux, follow these steps:
1.        The following command will disable SELINUX on all nodes:
# ansible nodes -m shell -a "sed -i 's/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=disabled/g' /etc/selinux/config"
  # ansible nodes -m shell -a "setenforce 0"
The command (above) may fail if SELinux is already disabled. This require reboot to take effect.
2.       q the machine, if needed for SELinux to be disabled in case it does not take effect. It can be checked using the following command:
# ansible nodes –a “sestatus”
  Set TCP Retries
Adjusting the tcp_retries parameter for the system network enables faster detection of failed nodes. Given the advanced networking features of UCS, this is a safe and recommended change (failures observed at the operating system layer are most likely serious rather than transitory).
To set TCP retries, follow these steps:
          On each node, set the number of TCP retries to 5 can help detect unreachable nodes with less latency.
1.        Edit the file /etc/sysctl.conf and on admin node rhel1 and add the following lines:
net.ipv4.tcp_retries2=5
Copy the /etc/sysctl.conf file from admin node (rhel1) to all the nodes using the following command:
# ansible nodes -m copy -a “src=/etc/sysctl.conf dest=/etc/sysctl.conf”
2.       Load the settings from default sysctl file /etc/sysctl.conf by running the following command:
# ansible nodes -m command -a “sysctl -p”
Disable the Linux Firewall
The default Linux firewall settings are far too restrictive for any Hadoop deployment. Since the UCS Big Data deployment will be in its own isolated network there is no need for that additional firewall.
# ansible all -m command -a "firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=80/tcp --permanent"
# ansible all -m command -a "firewall-cmd --reload"
# ansible all -m command -a “systemctl disable firewalld”
Disable Swapping
To disable swapping, follow these steps:
1.        In order to reduce Swapping, run the following on all nodes. Variable vm.swappiness defines how often swap should be used, 60 is default:
# ansible all -m shell -a “echo 'vm.swappiness=1' >> /etc/sysctl.conf"
2.       Load the settings from default sysctl file /etc/sysctl.conf and verify the content of sysctl.conf:
# ansible all -m shell -a "sysctl –p"
# ansible all -m shell -a “cat /etc/sysctl.conf”
  Disable Transparent Huge Pages
Disabling Transparent Huge Pages (THP) reduces elevated CPU usage caused by THP.
To disable Transparent Huge Pages, follow these steps:
1.        The following commands must be run for every reboot, so copy this command to /etc/rc.local so they are executed automatically for every reboot:
# ansible all -m shell -a "echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled”
# ansible all -m shell -a "echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag"
2.       On the Admin node, run the following commands:
#rm –f /root/thp_disable
#echo "echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled" >>
/root/thp_disable
#echo "echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag " >>
/root/thp_disable
3.        Copy file to each node:
# ansible nodes -m copy -a “src=/root/thp_disable dest=/root/thp_disable”
4.       Append the content of file thp_disable to /etc/rc.local:
# ansible nodes -m shell -a “cat /root/thp_disable >> /etc/rc.local”
Disable IPv6 Defaults
To disable IPv6 defaults, follow these steps:
1.        Disable IPv6 as the addresses used are IPv4:
# ansible all -m shell -a "echo 'net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1' >> /etc/sysctl.conf"
# ansible all -m shell -a "echo 'net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1' >> /etc/sysctl.conf"
# ansible all -m shell -a "echo 'net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1' >> /etc/sysctl.conf"
2.       Load the settings from default sysctl file /etc/sysctl.conf:
# ansible all -m shell -a "sysctl -p"
Configure Data Drives on Name Node and Other Management Nodes
This section describes the steps to configure non-OS disk drives as RAID1 using the StorCli command. All drives are part of a single RAID1 volume. This volume can be used for staging any client data to be loaded to HDFS. This volume will not be used for HDFS data.
To configure data drives on Name node and other nodes, follow these steps:
1.        From the website download storcli Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.https://www.broadcom.com/support/download-search/?pg=&pf=&pn=&po=&pa=&dk=storcli.
2.       Extract the zip file and copy storcli-1.14.12-1.noarch.rpm from the linux directory.
3.        Download storcli and its dependencies and transfer to Admin node:
#scp storcli-1.14.12-1.noarch.rpm rhel1:/root/
4.       Copy storcli rpm to all the nodes using the following commands:
# ansible all -m copy -a “src=/root/storcli-1.14.12-1.noarch.rpm dest=/root/.”
5.        Run this command to install storcli on all the nodes:
# ansible all -m shell -a “rpm -ivh storcli-1.14.12-1.noarch.rpm”
6.       Run this command to copy storcli64 to root directory:
# ansible all -m shell -a “cp /opt/MegaRAID/storcli/storcli64 /root/.”
7.        Run this command to check the state of the disks:
# ansible all -m shell -a "./storcli64 /c0 show"
          If the drive state shows up as JBOD, creating RAID in the subsequent steps will fail with the error “The specified physical disk does not have the appropriate attributes to complete the requested command.”
8.       If the drive state shows up as JBOD, it can be converted into Unconfigured Good using Cisco UCSM or storcli64 command. Following steps should be performed if the state is JBOD.
9.       Get the enclosure id as follows:
ansible all -m shell -a "./storcli64 pdlist -a0 | grep Enc | grep -v 252 | awk '{print $4}' | sort | uniq -c | awk '{print $2}'"  
            It is observed that some earlier versions of storcli64 complains about above mentioned command as if it is deprecated. In this case, please ./storcli64 /c0 show all| awk '{print $1}'| sed -n '/[0-9]:[0-9]/p'|awk '{print substr($1,1,2)}'|sort -u command to determine enclosure id.
10.    Convert to unconfigured good:
ansible datanodes -m command -a "./storcli64 /c0 /e66 /sall set good force"
  11.      Verify status by running the following command:
# ansible datanodes -m command -a "./storcli64 /c0 /e66 /sall show"
12.    Run this script as root user on rhel1 to rhel3 to create the virtual drives for the management nodes:
#vi /root/raid1.sh
./storcli64 -cfgldadd r1[$1:1,$1:2,$1:3,$1:4,$1:5,$1:6,$1:7,$1:8,$1:9,$1:10,$1:11,$1:12,$1:13,$1:14,$1:15,$1:16,$1:17,$1:18,$1:19,$1:20,$1:21,$1:22,$1:23,$1:24] wb ra nocachedbadbbu strpsz1024 -a0
          The script (above) requires enclosure ID as a parameter.
13.     Run the following command to get enclosure id:
#./storcli64 pdlist -a0 | grep Enc | grep -v 252 | awk '{print $4}' | sort | uniq -c | awk '{print $2}'
#chmod 755 raid1.sh
14.    Run MegaCli script:
#./raid1.sh <EnclosureID> obtained by running the command above
WB: Write back
RA: Read Ahead
NoCachedBadBBU: Do not write cache when the BBU is bad.
Strpsz1024: Strip Size of 1024K
          The command (above) will not override any existing configuration. To clear and reconfigure existing configurations refer to Embedded MegaRAID Software Users Guide available: www.broadcom.com.
15.     Run the following command. State should change to Online:
ansible namenodes -m command -a "./storcli64 /c0 /e66 /sall show"
16.    State can also be verified in UCSM as show below in Equipment>Rack-Mounts>Servers>Server # under Inventory/Storage/Disk tab:
Configure Data Drives on Data Nodes
To configure non-OS disk drives as individual RAID0 volumes using StorCli command, follow these steps. These volumes will be used for HDFS Data.
1.        Issue the following command from the admin node to create the virtual drives with individual RAID 0 configurations on all the data nodes:
[root@rhel1 ~]# ansible datanodes -m command -a "./storcli64 -cfgeachdskraid0 WB RA direct NoCachedBadBBU strpsz1024 -a0"

Configure the Filesystem for NameNodes and Datanodes
The following script formats and mounts the available volumes on each node whether it is NameNode or Data node. OS boot partition will be skipped. All drives are mounted based on their UUID as /data/disk1, /data/disk2, etc. To configure the filesystem for NameNodes and DataNodes, follow these steps:
1.        From the Admin node, create partition tables and file systems on the local disks supplied to each of the nodes, run the following script as the root user on each node:
          The script assumes there are no partitions already existing on the data volumes. If there are partitions, delete them before running the script. This process is documented in section Delete Partitions.
#vi /root/driveconf.sh

done
Run the following command to copy driveconf.sh to all the nodes:
# chmod 755 /root/driveconf.sh
# ansible datanodes -m copy -a “src=/root/driveconf.sh dest=/root/.”
# ansible nodes -m file -a "dest=/root/driveconf.sh mode=755"
2.       Run the following command from the admin node to run the script across all data nodes:
# ansible datanodes -m shell -a “/root/driveconf.sh”
3.        Run the following from the admin node to list the partitions and mount points:
# ansible datanodes -m shell -a “df –h”
# ansible datanodes -m shell -a “mount”
# ansible datanodes -m shell -a “cat /etc/fstab”
Delete Partitions
To delete a partition, follow these steps:
Run the mount command (‘mount’) to identify which drive is mounted to which device /dev/sd<?>
umount the drive for which partition is to be deleted and run fdisk to delete as shown below.
          Do not to delete the OS partition since this will wipe out the OS.
# mount
# umount /data/disk1 ç (disk1 shown as example)
#(echo d; echo w;) | sudo fdisk /dev/sd<?>
Cluster Verification
This section describes the steps to create the script cluster_verification.sh that helps to verify the CPU, memory, NIC, and storage adapter settings across the cluster on all nodes. This script also checks additional prerequisites such as NTP status, SELinux status, ulimit settings, JAVA_HOME settings and JDK version, IP address and hostname resolution, Linux version and firewall settings.
To verify a cluster, follow these steps:

2.       Under YARN tab, change the default log location by filtering the Log Dir property and modifying the /var prefix to /data/disk1.
          YARN requires other configurations such as config group, node labeling, enabling docker runtime, CPU/GPU scheduling and isolation, and so on, which can be found in section High Availability for HDFS NameNode and YARN ResourceManager.
          High Availability for NameNode and YARN Resource Manager can be configured using Ambari or also on non-Ambari clusters. This deployment guide explains the configuration of high availability using Ambari – Use the Ambari wizard interface to configure HA of the components.
The Ambari web UI provides a wizard-driven user experience that allows to configure high availability of the components in many Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) stack services. The high availability of the components are achieved by setting up primary and secondary components. In the event that the primary component fails or becomes unresponsive, services failover to secondary component. After configuring the high availability for a service, Ambari enables you to manage and disable (roll back) the high availability of components within that service.
Configure the HDFS NameNode High Availability
The HDFS NameNode high availability feature enables you to run redundant NameNodes in the same cluster in an Active/Passive configuration with a hot standby. This eliminates the NameNode as a potential single point of failure (SPOF) in an HDFS cluster. With the release of Hadoop 3.0, you can configure more than one backup NameNode.
Prior to the release of Hadoop 2.0, the NameNode represented a single point of failure (SPOF) in an HDFS cluster. Each cluster had a single NameNode, and if that machine or process became unavailable, the cluster as a whole would be unavailable until the NameNode was either restarted or brought up on a separate machine. This situation impacted the total availability of the HDFS cluster in two major ways:
·         In the case of an unplanned event such as a machine crash, the cluster would be unavailable until an operator restarted the NameNode.
·         Planned maintenance events such as software or hardware upgrades on the NameNode machine would result in periods of cluster downtime.
HDFS NameNode High Availability  avoids this by facilitating either a fast failover to one or more backup NameNodes during machine crash, or a graceful administrator-initiated failover during planned maintenance.
          Secondary NameNode is not required in high availability configuration because the Standby node also performs the tasks of the Secondary NameNode.

High Availability for HDFS NameNode and YARN ResourceManager
High availability for NameNode and YARN Resource Manager can be configured using Ambari or also on non-Ambari clusters. This deployment guide covers the configuration of high availability using Ambari – Use the Ambari wizard interface to configure HA of the components.
The Ambari web UI provides a wizard-driven user experience that allows to configure high availability of the components in many Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) stack services. The high availability of the components are achieved by setting up primary and secondary components. In the event that the primary component fails or becomes unresponsive, services failover to secondary component. After configuring the high availability for a service, Ambari enables you to manage and disable (roll back) the high availability of components within that service.
Configure the HDFS NameNode High Availability
The HDFS NameNode high availability feature enables you to run redundant NameNodes in the same cluster in an Active/Passive configuration with a hot standby. This eliminates the NameNode as a potential single point of failure (SPOF) in an HDFS cluster. With the release of Hadoop 3.0, you can configure more than one backup NameNode.
Prior to the release of Hadoop 2.0, the NameNode represented a single point of failure (SPOF) in an HDFS cluster. Each cluster had a single NameNode, and if that machine or process became unavailable, the cluster as a whole would be unavailable until the NameNode was either restarted or brought up on a separate machine. This situation impacted the total availability of the HDFS cluster in two major ways:
·         In the case of an unplanned event such as a machine crash, the cluster would be unavailable until an operator restarted the NameNode.
·         Planned maintenance events such as software or hardware upgrades on the NameNode machine would result in periods of cluster downtime.
HDFS NameNode HA avoids this by facilitating either a fast failover to one or more backup NameNodes during machine crash, or a graceful administrator-initiated failover during planned maintenance.
          Secondary NameNode is not required in high availability configuration because the Standby node also performs the tasks of the Secondary NameNode.
Active NameNode honors all the client requests and the Standby NameNode acts as a backup. The Standby NameNode keeps its state synchronized with Active NameNode through a group of JournalNodes(JNs). When the Active node performs any namespace modification, the Active node durably logs a modification record to a majority of these JNs. The Standby node reads the edits from the JNs and continuously watches the JNs for changes to the edit log.
Prerequisites for NameNode High Availability
The following are the prerequisites for NameNode high availability:
·         NameNode Machine: Hardware for Active and Standby node should be exactly identical.
·         JournalNodes Machine: JournalNode daemon is relatively lightweight, therefore it can be co-located on machines with other Hadoop daemons; it is typically located on the management nodes.
·         There MUST be at least three JournalNodes, because the edit log modifications must be written to a majority of JNs. This allows the system tolerate failure of a single machine. You may also run more than three JournalNodes, but in order to increase the number of failures that the system can tolerate, you must run an odd number of JNs (3, 5, 7, and so on).
·         ZooKeeper Machines: For automatic failover capability, an existing Zookeeper cluster must exist. The Zookeeper service can also co-exist with other Hadoop daemons.
·         In HA Cluster, the Standby NameNode also performs the checkpoints of the namespace state, therefore do not deploy a Secondary NameNode, CheckpointNode, or BackupNode in an high availability cluster.

Configure the YARN ResourceManger HA
This section provides instructions on setting up the ResourceManager (RM) HA feature in a HDFS cluster. The Active and Standby ResourceManagers embed the ZooKeeper based ActiveStandbyElector to determine which RM should be active.
Prerequisites for ResourceManager HA
The following are the prerequisites for ResourceManager HA:
·         The servers where Active and Standby RMs are run should have identical hardware.
·         For automated failover configurations, there must be an existing Zookeeper cluster available. The ZooKeeper service nodes can be co-located with the other Hadoop daemons.
          At least three ZooKeeper servers must be running.

Configure Data Drives on Name Node and Other Management Nodes
This section describes the steps needed to configure non-OS disk drives as RAID1 using the StorCli command. All drives are part of a single RAID1 volume. This volume can be used for staging any client data to be loaded to HDFS. This volume will not be used for HDFS data.
To configure data drives on Name node and other nodes, If the drive state shows up as JBOD, creating RAID in the subsequent steps will fail with the error “The specified physical disk does not have the appropriate attributes to complete the requested command.”
To configure data drives on Name Node and others, follow these steps:
1.        If the drive state shows up as JBOD, it can be converted into Unconfigured Good using Cisco UCSM or storcli64 command. Following steps should be performed if the state is JBOD.
2.       Get the enclosure id as follows:
ansible all -m shell -a "./storcli64 pdlist -a0 | grep Enc | grep -v 252 | awk '{print $4}' | sort | uniq -c | awk '{print $2}'"  
            It is observed that some earlier versions of storcli64 complains about above mentioned command as if it is deprecated. In this case, please use “./storcli64 /c0 show all| awk '{print $1}'| sed -n '/[0-9]:[0-9]/p'|awk '{print substr($1,1,2)}'|sort -u” command to determine enclosure id.
            In case of S3260 use -a0 and -a1 or c0 and c1 as there are two controller per node.
3.        Convert to unconfigured good:
ansible datanodes -m command -a "./storcli64 /c0 /e66 /sall set good force"
4.        Verify status by running the following command:
# ansible datanodes -m command -a "./storcli64 /c0 /e66 /sall show"
5.        Run this script as root user on rhel01 to rhel3 to create the virtual drives for the management nodes:
#vi /root/raid1.sh
./storcli64 -cfgldadd r1[$1:1,$1:2,$1:3,$1:4,$1:5,$1:6,$1:7,$1:8,$1:9,$1:10,$1:11,$1:12,$1:13,$1:14,$1:15,$1:16,$1:17,$1:18,$1:19,$1:20,$1:21,$1:22,$1:23,$1:24] wb ra nocachedbadbbu strpsz1024 -a0
          The script (above) requires enclosure ID as a parameter.
6.       Run the following command to get enclosure id:
#./storcli64 pdlist -a0 | grep Enc | grep -v 252 | awk '{print $4}' | sort | uniq -c | awk '{print $2}'
#chmod 755 raid1.sh
7.        Run MegaCli script:
#./raid1.sh <EnclosureID> obtained by running the command above
WB: Write back
RA: Read Ahead
NoCachedBadBBU: Do not write cache when the BBU is bad.
Strpsz1024: Strip Size of 1024K
          The command (above) will not override any existing configuration. To clear and reconfigure existing configurations refer to Embedded MegaRAID Software Users Guide available: www.broadcom.com.
8.       Run the following command. State should change to Online:
ansible namenodes -m command -a "./storcli64 /c0 /e66 /sall show"
9.       State can also be verified in UCSM as show below in Equipment>Rack-Mounts>Servers>Server # under Inventory/Storage/Disk tab:
Configure Data Drives on Data Nodes
To configure non-OS disk drives as individual RAID0 volumes using StorCli command, follow these steps. These volumes will be used for HDFS Data.
1.        Issue the following command from the admin node to create the virtual drives with individual RAID 0 configurations on all the data nodes:
[root@rhel01 ~]# ansible datanodes -m command -a "./storcli64 -cfgeachdskraid0 WB RA direct NoCachedBadBBU strpsz1024 -a0"

Cloudera Data Science Workbench (CDSW)
Cloudera Data Science Workbench runs on one or more dedicated gateway / edge hosts on HDP clusters. A gateway host is one that does not have any cluster services running on them. They only run the clients for cluster services (such as the HDFS Client, YARN Client, Spark2 Client, and so on). These clients ensure that Cloudera Data Science Workbench has all the libraries and configuration files necessary to securely access the HDP cluster and their respective services.
Cloudera Data Science Workbench does not support running any other services on these gateway hosts. Each gateway host must be dedicated solely to Cloudera Data Science Workbench. This is because user workloads require dedicated CPU and memory, which might conflict with other services running on these hosts.
From the gateway hosts assigned to Cloudera Data Science Workbench, one will serve as the master host, which also runs the CDSW web application, while others will serve as worker hosts. You should note that worker hosts are not required for a fully-functional Cloudera Data Science Workbench deployment. For proof-of-concept deployments you can deploy a 1-host cluster with just a Master host. The Master host can run user workloads just as a worker can.
CDSW has pre-requisites, one of which is CUDA. CUDA itself also has prerequisites. The order of installation is follows:
·         CUDA pre-requisites
·         CUDA
·         CDSW pre-requisites
·         CDSW
          This CVD incorporates 6x Cisco UCS C240 M5 with 2x T4 GPUs; the following steps in this section detail how to enable GPU as a Hadoop resource.

     [root@rhel1 ~]# ansible gpunodes -m shell -a "/usr/local/cuda-10.1/bin/nvcc --version"
     [root@rhel1 ~]# ansible gpunodes -m shell -a "export NVIDIA_DRIVER_VERSION=418.67"
Installation Prerequisites for CDSW
To install the prerequisites for CDSW, complete the steps in the following sections on all CDSW nodes:
          For more information, refer to:  https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/data-science-workbench/latest/topics/cdsw_requirements_supported_versions.html#cdsw_requirements_supported_versions and https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/data-science-workbench/1-6-x/topics/cdsw_install.html
Set Up a Wildcard DNS Subdomain
Cloudera Data Science Workbench uses subdomains to provide isolation for user-generated HTML and JavaScript, and routing requests between services. To set up subdomains for Cloudera Data Science Workbench, configure your DNS server with an A record for a wildcard DNS name such as *.cdsw.<your_domain>.com for the master host, and a second A record for the root entry of cdsw.<your_domain>.com.
You can also use a wildcard CNAME record if it is supported by your DNS provider.
          This Wildcard DNS subdomain need to be used by the jump host/edge node or the bastion server as well. For more information, refer to: https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/data-science-workbench/1-6-x/topics/cdsw_install.html#wildcard_dns
          For the Solution validation we had installed DNS server on windows 2012 R2 and setup DNS wild card configuration on the same.
With dnsmasq, to add a wildcard DNS subdomain, do the following for just the master host:
1.        Update /etc/dnsmasq.conf to enable Wildcard entry:
address=/cdsw/10.15.1.53
#service dnsmasq restart
2.       Test the working of wildcard DNS with dig or nslookup:
#nslookup *.cdsw.<your domain>.com
#dig cdsw.<your_domain>.com
#dig *.cdsw.<your domain>.com
          For more information, go to: https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/data-science-workbench/latest/topics/cdsw_install.html#pre_install.
Supported JDK Version
The entire HDP cluster, including Cloudera Data Science Workbench gateway nodes, must use Oracle JDK. OpenJDK is not supported by CDH, HDP Ambari, or Cloudera Data Science Workbench.
Spark 2 which is needed by CDSW to run Spark jobs (on Hadoop nodes) requires JDK 1.8. On CSD-based deployments, the version of Java installed on Cloudera Data Science Workbench gateway hosts and also updating the JAVA home directory in the “cdsw.conf” file located in /etc/cdsw/config directory..
To update the JDK version, go to “Changing the JDK version on an Existing HDP Cluster”
          For more details, go to: https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/release-notes/topics/rn_consolidated_pcm.html#pcm_jdk
IP Tables and Security on CDSW Nodes
Disable all pre-existing iptables rules. While Kubernetes makes extensive use of iptables, it is difficult to predict how pre-existing iptables rules will interact with the rules inserted by Kubernetes. Therefore, Cloudera recommends you use the following commands to disable all pre-existing rules before you proceed with the installation.
yum -y install iptables-service
yum install initscripts
systemctl stop firewalld
systemctl mask firewalld
systemctl disable firewalld
systemctl enable iptables
systemctl start iptables
iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -F
iptables -t mangle -F
iptables -F
iptables -X
service iptables save
          For more information about Cloudera Data Science Workbench 1.5.x Requirements and Supported Platforms, go to: https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/data-science-workbench/latest/topics/cdsw_requirements_supported_versions.html
          Please refer to section Disable SELinux if SELinux is enabled.
Configure Block Devices
Docker Block Device
The Cloudera Data Science Workbench installer will format and mount Docker on each gateway host. Make sure there is no important data stored on these devices. Do not mount these block devices prior to installation.
Application Block Device or Mount Point
The master host on Cloudera Data Science Workbench requires at least 500 GB for database and project storage. This recommended capacity is contingent on the expected number of users and projects on the cluster. While large data files should be stored on HDFS, it is not uncommon to find gigabytes of data or libraries in individual projects. Running out of storage will cause the application to fail. Make sure you continue to carefully monitor disk space usage and I/O using HDP 3.1.0.
          To enable data resilience, enable this drive as RAID1 of SSDs (using commands as shown in configuring namenode).
Cloudera Data Science Workbench will store all application data at /var/lib/cdsw. In a CSD-based deployment, this location is not configurable. Cloudera Data Science Workbench will assume the system administrator has formatted and mounted one or more block devices to /var/lib/cdsw.
Regardless of the application data storage configuration you choose, /var/lib/cdsw must be stored on a separate block device (the RAID1 of SSDs created for this).
Download and Install CDSW with HDP 3.1.0
To download and install CDSW, complete the following steps:
1.        Log into the Ambari Server
2.       Go to the Hosts page and select Actions > + Add New Hosts.
3.        On the Install Options page, enter the fully-qualified domain names for your new hosts.
The wizard also needs the private key file you created when you set up password-less SSH. Using the host names and key file information, the wizard can locate, access, and interact securely with all the hosts in the cluster. Alternatively, you can manually install and start the Ambari agents on all the new hosts.
4.       Click Register and Confirm. For more detailed instructions, refer to “https://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/Ambari-2.6.2.2/bk_ambari-installation/content/install_options.html”
5.        The Confirm Hosts page prompts you to confirm that Ambari has located the correct hosts for your cluster and to check those hosts to make sure they have the correct directories, packages, and processes required to continue the install. When you are satisfied with the list of hosts, click Next.
For detailed instructions, go to https://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/Ambari-2.6.2.2/bk_ambari-installation/content/confirm_hosts.html.
6.       On the Assign Slaves and Clients page, select the Clients that should be installed on the new hosts. To install clients on all hosts, select the Client checkbox for every host. You can use the all option for each available client to expedite this.
          Make sure no other services are running on these hosts. To make this easier, select the none option for all other services.
7.        On the Configurations page, select the “configuration groups” for the new hosts.
8.       The Review page displays the host assignments you have made. Check to make sure everything is correct. If you need to make changes, use the left navigation bar to return to the appropriate screen.
9.       Click Deploy.
10.    The Install, Start and Test page displays progress as the clients are installed and deployed on each host. When the process is complete, click Next.
11.     The Summary page provides you a list of the accomplished tasks. Click Complete and you will be directed back to the Hosts page.
Create HDFS User Directories
To run workloads that leverage HDP cluster services, make sure that HDFS directories (/user/<username>) are created for each user so that they can seamlessly connect to HDP from Cloudera Data Science Workbench.
Follow these steps for each user directory that must be created:
1.        SSH to a host in the cluster that includes the HDFS client.
2.       Switch to the hdfs system account user:
su - hdfs
3.        Create an HDFS directory for the user. For example, you would create the following directory for the default user admin:
hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/admin
4.       Assign ownership of the new directory to the user. For example, for the new /user/admin directory, make the admin user the owner of the directory:
hdfs dfs -chown admin:hadoop /user/admin
Install Cloudera Data Science Workbench on the Master Host
To install Cloudera Data Science Workbench on the master host, follow these steps: 
          The airgapped clusters and non-airgapped clusters use different files for installation. We used non-airgapped Installations
1.        Download Cloudera Data Science Workbench:
For non-airgapped installations, download this file and save it to /etc/yum.repos.d/: cloudera-cdsw.repo
2.       The Cloudera Public GPG repository key verifies that you are downloading genuine packages. Add the repository key:
sudo rpm --import https://archive.cloudera.com/cdsw1/1.5.0/redhat7/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-cloudera
3.        Install the latest RPM with the following command:
sudo yum install cloudera-data-science-workbench
4.       Initialize and start Cloudera Data Science Workbench:
cdsw start
The application will take a few minutes to bootstrap. You can watch the status of the application installation and startup with watch cdsw status.
Install Cloudera Data Science Workbench on Worker Hosts
To install Cloudera Data Science Workbench on worker hosts, follow these steps:
          Worker hosts are not required for a fully-functional Cloudera Data Science Workbench deployment. For proof-of-concept deployments, you can deploy a 1-host cluster with just a Master host. The Master host can run user workloads just as a worker host can.
1.        Download Cloudera Data Science Workbench:
For non-airgapped installations, download this file and save it to /etc/yum.repos.d/: cloudera-cdsw.repo
2.       The Cloudera Public GPG repository key verifies that you are downloading genuine packages. Add the repository key:
sudo rpm --import https://archive.cloudera.com/cdsw1/1.5.0/redhat7/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-cloudera
3.        Install the latest RPM with the following command:
sudo yum install cloudera-data-science-workbench
4.       Copy cdsw.conf file from the master host:
scp root@<cdsw-master-hostname.your_domain.com>:/etc/cdsw/config/cdsw.conf /etc/cdsw/config/cdsw.conf
After initialization, the cdsw.conf file includes a generated bootstrap token that allows worker hosts to securely join the cluster. You can get this token by copying the configuration file from master and ensuring it has 600 permissions.
If your hosts have heterogeneous block device configurations, modify the Docker block device settings in the worker host configuration file after you copy it. Worker hosts do not need application block devices, which store the project files and database state, and this configuration option is ignored.
5.        Create /var/lib/cdsw on the worker host. This directory must exist on all worker hosts. Without it, the next step that registers the worker host with the master will fail.
6.       Unlike the master host, the /var/lib/cdsw directory on worker hosts does not need to be mounted to an Application Block Device. It is only used to store client configuration for HDP services on workers.
7.        Initialize and start Cloudera Data Science Workbench:
cdsw join
This causes the worker hosts to register themselves with the Cloudera Data Science Workbench master host and increase the available pool of resources for workloads.
8.       Return to the master host and verify the host is registered with this command:
cdsw status
Create the Administrator Account
After your installation is complete, set up the initial administrator account.
You must access Cloudera Data Science Workbench from the Cloudera Data Science Workbench Domain configured when setting up the service, and not the hostname of the master node. Visiting the hostname of the master node will result in a 404 error.
The first account that you create becomes the site administrator. You may now use this account to create a new project and start using the workbench to run data science workloads.
Non-Kerberized Clusters
          In this CVD, Kerberos is not enabled.
            To enable Kerberos, refer to: https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/data-science-workbench/latest/topics/cdsw_kerberos.html.
1.        To disable Kerberos, delete the file /etc/krb5.conf on the CDSW nodes.
2.       For a non-kerberized cluster, by default, your Hadoop username will be set to your Cloudera Data Science Workbench login username. Override this default and set an alternative HADOOP_USER_NAME (“admin” in this case which was the admin user created).
3.        Create User admin in hdfs.
# sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/admin
# sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs -chown admin:admin /user/admin
  4.       Go to the Settings on Cloudera Data Science WorkBench, Click on Hadoop Authentication > Hadoop Username Override. Enter admin. Click on Authenticate.
  5.        Restart CDSW from command-line using “cdsw stop” followed by “cdsw start”.
Use GPUs for Cloudera Data Science Workbench Workloads
A GPU is a specialized processor that can be used to accelerate highly parallelized computationally intensive workloads. Because of their computational power, GPUs have been found to be particularly well-suited to deep learning workloads. Ideally, CPUs and GPUs should be used in tandem for data engineering and data science workloads. A typical machine learning workflow involves data preparation, model training, model scoring, and model fitting. You can use existing general-purpose CPUs for each stage of the workflow, and optionally accelerate the math-intensive steps with the selective application of special-purpose GPUs. For example, GPUs allow you to accelerate model fitting using frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, MXNet, and Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK).
By enabling GPU support, data scientists can share GPU resources available on Cloudera Data Science Workbench nodes. Users can request a specific number of GPU instances, up to the total number available on a node, which are then allocated to the running session or job for the duration of the run. Projects can use isolated versions of libraries, and even different CUDA and cuDNN versions via Cloudera Data Science Workbench's extensible engine feature.
          For more information, go to: https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/data-science-workbench/latest/topics/cdsw_gpu.html.
Enable GPU with CDSW
·         Cloudera Data Science Workbench only supports CUDA-enabled NVIDIA GPU cards.
·         Cloudera Data Science Workbench does not support heterogeneous GPU hardware in a single deployment.
·         Cloudera Data Science Workbench does not include an engine image that supports NVIDIA libraries. Create your own custom CUDA-capable engine image using the instructions described in this topic.
·         Cloudera Data Science Workbench does not install or configure the NVIDIA drivers on the Cloudera Data Science Workbench gateway hosts. These depend on your GPU hardware and will have to be installed by your system administrator. The steps provided in this topic are generic guidelines that will help you evaluate your setup.
·         The instructions described in this topic require Internet access. If you have an airgapped deployment, you will be required to manually download and load the resources onto your hosts.
·         For a list of known issues associated with this feature, refer Known Issues - GPU Support.
This section provides instructions about creating your own custom CUDA-capable engine image.
To enable Docker containers to use the GPUs, the previously installed NVIDIA driver libraries must be removed and since by default CDSW version 1.5 does not come with nvidia-docker 1.0 plugins which is a thin wrapper around the Docker CLI and a Docker plugin, shall be installed separately.
1.        Set the following parameter in /etc/cdsw/config/cdsw.conf on all Cloudera Data Science Workbench hosts. You must make sure that cdsw.conf is consistent across all hosts, irrespective of whether they have GPU hardware installed on them.
The following sample steps demonstrate how to use nvidia-docker to set up the directory structure for the drivers so that they can be easily consumed by the Docker containers that will leverage the GPU. Perform these steps on all nodes with GPU hardware installed.
          CDSW 1.5 does not ships with nvidia-docker version 1.0 and shall be installed independently.
2.       Run a small container to create the Docker volume structure
#docker run --rm nvidia/cuda nvidia-smi
  Use the following Docker command to verify that Cloudera Data Science Workbench can access the GPU:
#vi nvidia-gpu-access.sh
mkdir /var/lib/nvidia-docker/
mkdir /var/lib/nvidia-docker/volumes/
mkdir /var/lib/nvidia-docker/volumes/nvidia_driver/
mkdir /var/lib/nvidia-docker/volumes/nvidia_driver/418.67
mkdir /var/lib/nvidia-docker/volumes/nvidia_driver/418.67/bin
mkdir /var/lib/nvidia-docker/volumes/nvidia_driver/418.67/lib64
cp /usr/bin/nvidia* /var/lib/nvidia-docker/volumes/nvidia_driver/418.67/bin
cp /usr/lib64/libcuda* /var/lib/nvidia-docker/volumes/nvidia_driver/418.67/lib64
cp /usr/lib64/libnvidia* /var/lib/nvidia-docker/volumes/nvidia_driver/418.67/lib64
          Please replace the version of NVidia driver to one that matches your environment. Run “nvidia-smi” to capture the running version of NVidia driver.
3.        In CDSW, local mount point (/usr/local/nvidia) for the docker containers will be established manually while creating the directory and copying the files from the CUDA library locations:
# docker run --net host \
--device=/dev/nvidiactl \
--device=/dev/nvidia-uvm \
--device=/dev/nvidia0 \
-v /var/lib/nvidia-docker/volumes/nvidia_driver/418.67/:/usr/local/nvidia/ \
-it nvidia/cuda \
usr/local/nvidia/bin/nvidia-smi
  Test Cloudera Data Science Workbench to Detect GPUs
Once Cloudera Data Science Workbench has successfully restarted, if NVIDIA drivers have been installed on the Cloudera Data Science Workbench hosts, Cloudera Data Science Workbench will now be able to detect the GPUs available on its hosts.
Create a Custom CUDA-Capable Engine Image
The base engine image (docker.repository.cloudera.com/cdsw/engine:8) that ships with Cloudera Data Science Workbench will need to be extended with CUDA libraries to make it possible to use GPUs in jobs and sessions.
          For more information, go to https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/data-science-workbench/latest/topics/cdsw_gpu.html.
Run a Local Registry
To start the registry container, run the following command:
# docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry:2
      The following sample Dockerfile illustrates an engine on top of which machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch can be used. This Dockerfile uses a deep learning library from NVIDIA called NVIDIA CUDA Deep Neural Network (cuDNN). Make sure you check with the machine learning framework that you intend to use in order to know which version of cuDNN is needed. As an example, TensorFlow 1.14.0 uses CUDA 10.0 and requires cuDNN 7.4.
1.        To create the cuda.Dockerfile, run the following command:
FROM  docker.repository.cloudera.com/cdsw/engine:8
  RUN NVIDIA_GPGKEY_SUM=d1be581509378368edeec8c1eb2958702feedf3bc3d17011adbf24efacce4ab5 && \
    NVIDIA_GPGKEY_FPR=ae09fe4bbd223a84b2ccfce3f60f4b3d7fa2af80 && \
    apt-key adv --fetch-keys http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1604/x86_64/7fa2af80.pub && \
    apt-key adv --export --no-emit-version -a $NVIDIA_GPGKEY_FPR | tail -n +5 > cudasign.pub && \
    echo "$NVIDIA_GPGKEY_SUM  cudasign.pub" | sha256sum -c --strict - && rm cudasign.pub && \
    echo "deb http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1604/x86_64 /" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cuda.list
  ENV CUDA_VERSION 10.1.168
LABEL com.nvidia.cuda.version="${CUDA_VERSION}"
  ENV CUDA_PKG_VERSION 10-1=$CUDA_VERSION-1
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        cuda-cudart-$CUDA_PKG_VERSION && \
    ln -s cuda-10.1 /usr/local/cuda && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
  RUN echo "/usr/local/cuda/lib64" >> /etc/ld.so.conf.d/cuda.conf && \
    ldconfig
  RUN echo "/usr/local/nvidia/lib" >> /etc/ld.so.conf.d/nvidia.conf && \
    echo "/usr/local/nvidia/lib64" >> /etc/ld.so.conf.d/nvidia.conf
  ENV PATH /usr/local/nvidia/bin:/usr/local/cuda/bin:${PATH}
ENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/nvidia/lib:/usr/local/nvidia/lib64
  RUN echo "deb http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/machine-learning/repos/ubuntu1604/x86_64 /" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-ml.list
  ENV CUDNN_VERSION 7.6.2.24
LABEL com.nvidia.cudnn.version="${CUDNN_VERSION}"
  RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
            libcudnn7=$CUDNN_VERSION-1+cuda10.1 && \
    apt-mark hold libcudnn7 && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
2.       Build a custom engine image out of cuda.Dockerfile using the following sample command:
docker build --network host -t <company-registry>/cdsw-cuda:8 . -f cuda.Dockerfile
  3.        Push this new engine image to a public Docker registry so that it can be made available for Cloudera Data Science Workbench workloads. For example:
docker push <company-registry>/cdsw-cuda:8
            For more information about creating a local docker registry, refer to: https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/#copy-an-image-from-docker-hub-to-your-registry
Image Management
Images can be preloaded on all NodeManager hosts or they can be implicitly pulled at runtime if they are available in a public Docker registry, such as Docker hub. If the image does not exist on the NodeManager and cannot be pulled, the container will fail.
          For AI framework specific images, it is recommend using Docker images from NG Cloud, which is described in subsequent sections of this document.
            It is also recommended to have a private Docker image repository. This CVD details the setup of a private registry for simplicity but doesn’t go into details on a registry setup with high availability and is provided only as an example.
          On a Multi-GPU, server, the output of this command will show all the GPUs for some reason. This behavior needs to be further validated with the vendors.
Configure CDSW to Run Docker Containers
Set Up Docker Registry
Private trusted registry is required to provision YARN container. This topic provides basic information about deploying and configuring a registry.
          This is a sample registry to showcase the use-case and not recommended for Production grade setup.
Designate a Server for Docker and Start the Registry
To designate a server for Docker and start the registry, follow these steps:
1.        Designate a server in the cluster for the Docker registry. Minimal resources are required, but sufficient disk space is needed to store the images and metadata. Docker must be installed and running.
2.       Optional: By default, data will only be persisted within the container. If you would like to persist the data on the host, you can customize the bind mounts using the -v option.
3.        Create /var/lib/registry folder:
# mkdir /var/lib/registry
4.       Configure Docker to allow pulling from this insecure registry. Modify /etc/docker/daemon.json on all nodes in the cluster to include the following configuration options:
# cat /etc/docker/daemon.json
{
    "live-restore" : true,
    "debug" : true,
    "insecure-registries" : ["linuxjh.hdp3.cisco.com:5000"]
}
5.        Restart Docker on all nodes.
6.       Provision the registry container by running the following command:
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry -v /mnt/registry:/var/lib/registry registry:2
7.        Verify the registry container is provisioned by running docker ps command:
[root@LinuxJB ~]# docker ps -a

  Allocate GPUs for Sessions and Jobs
Once Cloudera Data Science Workbench has been enabled to use GPUs, a site administrator must whitelist the CUDA-capable engine image created in the previous step. Site administrators can also set a limit on the maximum number of GPUs that can be allocated per session or job.
To allocate GPUs for sessions and jobs, follow these steps:
6.       Sign into Cloudera Data Science Workbench as a site administrator.
7.        Click Admin.
8.       Go to the Engines tab.
9.       From the Maximum GPUs per Session/Job drop-down list, select the maximum number of GPUs that can be used by an engine.
10.    Under Engine Images, add the custom CUDA-capable engine image created in the previous step. This whitelists the image and allows project administrators to use the engine in their jobs and sessions. Enter description and Tag created for repository. Click Add.
Project administrators can now whitelist the CUDA engine image to make it available for sessions and jobs within a particular project by completing the following steps:
1.        Go to Projects Overview.
2.       Click on any existing project or create a new project and choose Settings.
3.        Go to the Engines tab.
4.       Under Engine Image, add the CUDA-capable engine image.
5.        Go to the Sessions tab and click an existing session or create a new session and allocate resources.
6.       Click Terminal Access.
