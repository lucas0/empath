Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCvb64782 SUDI Verification Feature Supported in Release 15.2(7)E4 or Later
Problem Description
In order to detect and mitigate device counterfeiting and malicious attacks on hardware and software, Cisco uses Hardware Trust Anchor, Secure Unique Device Identifier (SUDI), digitally signed software images, secure boot, and other multilayered security approaches to verify the authenticity and integrity of our solutions. These trustworthy technologies run automated checks of hardware and software integrity and can shut down the boot process if a compromise is detected.
Cisco Catalyst 2960X/2960XR platforms should be upgraded to Cisco IOS® Release 15.2(7)E4 or later in order to enable this SUDI verification before devices are onboarded into your network. The latest software can be downloaded from the Cisco Software Download website.
Cisco encourages customers to buy only genuine gear from Cisco Authorized Partners. Because of the pervasiveness of the Cisco Catalyst 2960X/2960XR switches on the grey market, it is imperative that customers enable the latest software release in order to validate the authenticity, security, and performance of their switch.
Background
The illicit grey market for Cisco's gear carries significant risk for customers who buy unauthorized secondhand, third-party, or even stolen networking gear. Cisco's 2960X/2960XR switches have been a flagship product for many years, and subsequently have been diverted into the grey market.
Cisco always recommends that customers buy from Cisco Authorized Partners. If you choose to purchase Cisco products from a source on the grey market, you might take these risks:
Counterfeit Products - The purchase of Cisco products from an unauthorized reseller might put your company at risk of receiving counterfeit Cisco products. Counterfeit products might cause severe damage to the network your company depends on for its business operations or introduce security vulnerabilities. Additionally, counterfeit Cisco products are not eligible for any Cisco support services. See the Cisco Non-Entitlement Policy for more information.
Licensing - Cisco sells its products with end-user licenses that permit the end user of the product to use the software Cisco provides, for example, Cisco IOS software contained on a Cisco router or switch. If your company purchases Cisco products from an unauthorized reseller, you might not have a valid software license, in which case you would need to purchase a software license or submit a request and be approved for a license transfer. See the  Cisco Hardware Inspection and Software Relicensing Program for more information.
Warranties - Cisco products are sold with end-user warranties that apply to the original end user who purchased the product from a Cisco Authorized Partner. These express warranties cannot be transferred to any subsequent user of Cisco equipment unless specifically authorized by Cisco. Cisco might not provide warranty support for any equipment that you purchase from an unauthorized reseller. This does not affect any warranty Cisco is required to provide by applicable laws. See the Cisco Non-Entitlement Policy for more information..
Support Plans - If you purchase a Cisco product from an unauthorized reseller, the said product is not automatically eligible for Cisco SMARTnet or Smart Net Total Care support services. Cisco must first evaluate the product's eligibility to receive support services (that is, ensure that product is genuine, no changes have been made to the Cisco hardware or software, and to confirm that the product still functions according to Cisco's specifications and customer expectations). Cisco's policy is to charge an inspection fee for this evaluation.  In full, this policy is set forth in Cisco Hardware Inspection and Software Relicensing Program. See Cisco's Smart Net Total Care website for more information.
Third-Party Components - If you report a fault or defect in a Cisco product, which can be traced to the use of third-party components that include, but are not limited to, third-party memory, cables, or gigabit interface controllers (GBICs) installed by your company or unauthorized reseller for use in conjunction with the said Cisco product, Cisco might withhold warranty and/or support services for such Cisco product. See the Cisco Non-Entitlement Policy for more information.
The Cisco Brand Protection team partners closely with both law enforcement and customs officials around the world to stop counterfeit products at borders, identify counterfeiting operations, and pursue legal actions against infringers of Cisco’s intellectual property rights, which includes trademarks. Cisco’s goal is to actively support our partners and customers in protecting their investment in Cisco solutions.
Problem Symptom
Counterfeit devices run the risk of disrupting normal system operation and can show any abnormal behavior.
Some of the common error logs which might be observed include, but are not limited to, these logs:
%ILET-1-AUTHENTICATION_FAIL: This Switch may not have been manufactured by Cisco or with Cisco's authorization. This product may contain software that was copied in violation of Cisco's license terms. If your use of this product is the cause of a support issue, Cisco may deny operation of the product, support under your warranty or under a Cisco technical support program such as Smartnet. Please contact Cisco's Technical Assistance Center for more information.
%ILET-1-DEVICE_AUTHENTICATION_FAIL: The FlexStack Module inserted in this switch might not have been manufactured by Cisco or with Cisco's authorization. If your use of this product is the cause of a support issue, Cisco might deny operation of the product, support under your warranty or under a Cisco technical support program such as Smartnet. Please contact Cisco's Technical Assistance Center (TAC) for more information.
Workaround/Solution
The process to validate the SUDI on a Cisco Catalyst 2960X/2960XR device is described in this section. The implementation of SUDI is based on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and the associated cryptography.
Note: Steps 2 and 3 require access to the openssl command. This is not a Cisco IOS CLI command. The openssl command is available in most Linux distributions (such as Ubuntu) and MacOS.
Microsoft Windows does not have it available with the installation, but there are third-party binaries available for download.
Step 1. Gather Device Data
Data needed from the device for this validation includes:
Basic information listed in the output of the show version CLI command.
Details for SUDI verification with the output of the show platform sudi certificate sign nonce [nonce] CLI command. This CLI command is only available in Cisco IOS Release 15.2.7E4 and later.
In order to confirm the output is not tampered in any way, include the 'sign' option with a 'nonce' in the command. The value of the nonce shall be a random number decided when you enter the command. Do not use a static value for all validations on a particular device.
Sample Output:
Switch#show platform sudi certificate sign nonce 123

Step 2. Verify the X.509v3 Certificates
The result of SUDI verification contains three X.509v3 certificates - Certficate 1, Certificate 2, and Certificate 3 in the previous sample output.
Certificate 1 is the Cisco Root Certificate Authority (CA) certificate and Certificate 2 is the signing SUDI CA certificate. In order to verify the certificates, download the official X.509v3 certificates - Cisco Root CA 2048 (crca2048) - PEM and ACT2 SUDI CA - PEM from the Cisco PKI website and compare them with the ones listed in the SUDI verification (show platform sudi certificate sign nonce [nonce command) output.
Certificate 1 from the device output should match with Cisco Root CA 2048 (crca2048) - PEM downloaded from the website.
Certificate 2 from the device output should match with ACT2 SUDI CA - PEM downloaded from the website.
Optional Step: Additionally, the openssl command can be used to extract the certificate type from the Subject line in the certificate. Refer to this sample output:

subject=O = Cisco, CN = ACT2 SUDI CA
Step 3. Verify the Device Identity
The third X.509v3 certificate (Certificate 3 in the sample output) in the result of SUDI verification is the SUDI certificate. It is important to confirm the device identity specified in this certificate which should match the device information.
The openssl command can be used to extract the device ID (Product ID (PID) and Serial Number (SN)) from the Subject line in the SUDI certificate.
