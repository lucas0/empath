Introduction
This document describes the basic configuration and correct commit order to onboard a cEdge to a Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) overlay.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:
Cisco SD-WAN
Basic Cisco Cisco IOSÂ® XE Command Line Interface (CLI)
Components Used
This document is based on these software and hardware versions:
 cEdge version 17.6.3
 vManage version 20.6.3
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Note: This guide assumes that for physical routers the cEdge Serial Number is already in Cisco Network Plug & Play (PnP) portal and synced with vManage devices list; and for virtual cEdges, that a virtual instance is added to PnP portal and synced to vManage. 
Mode Verification
Step 1. Verify the router is on Controller-Managed mode.
show platform software device-mode
show version | in mode
Example:
Router# show platform software device-mode 
Device Operating-mode: Controller-Managed 
Device-mode bootup status: 
 8/03 00:44:16 System is green
 Bootup Success 
Router# show version | in mode                                                                                                            
Router operating mode: Controller-Managed                                                                                                   
Note: If the operating mode results in Autonomous, move the router to Controller-Managed with controller-mode enable command.
Step 2. Perform a software reset.
For a new onboard it is recommended to clean the device up with a software reset, this ensures all previous configurations in the Configuration Data Base (CBD) are removed.
Router# request platform software sdwan software reset 
The device reloads and boots up with blank configuration.
Step 3. Stop PNP discovery process.
If no Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) is required, stop PNP discovery process.
Router# pnpa service discovery stop
Note: PNP process stops within 5-10 minutes.
Configuration
There are two scenarios covered:
Physical interfaces
Sub interfaces
Both scenarios need an IOS XE tunnel and an SD-WAN tunnel associated with an interface to work and basic SD-WAN system configuration.
Physical Interface Configuration
The interface and tunnel configuration for VPN 0 or Global VRF requires a specific order, otherwise, there are errors in the tunnel interface associations.
Configuration order:
Physical Interface 
Default route 
Commit changes
XE tunnel with a physical interface as source
SDWAN XE tunnel 
Commit changes
Example:
!IOS-XE Portion
!
config-transaction
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0
ip address 192.168.10.2 255.255.255.0
negotiation auto 
no shutdown
!
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.10.1
!
commit    <<<<<<<<<< Commit changes here
!
interface Tunnel0
no shutdown
ip unnumbered GigabitEthernet0/0/0
tunnel source GigabitEthernet0/0/0
tunnel mode sdwan
exit
!
! SD-WAN portion
!
sdwan
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0
tunnel-interface
encapsulation ipsec
color default
allow-service all
!
commit    <<<<<<<<<< Commit changes here
!
end
If the changes are committed in a different order, it can lead to an error because the IOS XE Tunnel interface is not associated with the SDWAN Tunnel Interface.
cEdge(config-if)# commit
Aborted: 'interface Tunnel 0 ios-tun:tunnel': Tunnel interface doesn't have corresponding sdwan GigabitEthernet0/0/0 interface
In the opposite direction, if an SDWAN tunnel is attempted to be removed without the IOS XE tunnel simultaneously, it can lead to a reference error.
cEdge(config)# commit
Aborted: 'sdwan interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0 tunnel-interface' : No Tunnel interface found with tunnel source set to SDWAN interface
Subinterface Configuration
The physical interface, sub interface, and tunnel configuration for VPN 0 or Global VRF require a specific order, otherwise, there are errors in the tunnel interface associations.
Configuration order:
Physical Interface 
Subinterface
Default route 
Commit changes
XE tunnel with a sub interface as source
SDWAN XE tunnel 
Commit changes
Example:
!IOS-XE Portion
!
config-transaction
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0
no shutdown
no ip address
ip mtu 1500
mtu 1500
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0.100
no shutdown
encapsulation dot1Q 100
ip address 192.168.10.2 255.255.255.0
ip mtu 1496
mtu 1496
!
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.10.1
!
commit      <<<<<<<<<< Commit changes here

end
Note: To accommodate the 32-bit field added to packets by the 802.1Q protocol, the MTU for subinterfaces must be at least 4 bytes smaller than the MTU of the physical interface. This is configured with the mtu<value> command. The default MTU on a physical interface is 1500 bytes, hence the MTU of the subinterface must not be larger than 1496 bytes. Also, if the subinterface requires an MTU of 1500 bytes, the physical interface MTU can be adjusted to 1504 bytes.
If the changes are committed in a different order, it can lead to an error because the IOS XE Tunnel interface is not associated with the SDWAN Tunnel Interface.
cEdge(config)# commit
Aborted: 'sdwan interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0.100 tunnel-interface' : No Tunnel interface found with tunnel source set to SDWAN interface
System Configuration
In order to join the SD-WAN fabric, the cEdge needs basic overlay information under system so that it can start the authentication with vBond.
System IP: Unique identifier for the cEdge, it comes in octal dotted format. It is not a routable IP.
Site ID: Unique identifier of the site.
Organization Name: Unique identifier of the SD-WAN overlay.
vBond IP and port: vBond IP and port. It can be obtained from the vBond itself with show sdwan running-config system command.
Example:
config-transaction
system
system-ip 10.10.10.1
site-id 10
organization-name SDWAN-OVERLAY
vbond 172.16.120.20 port 12346  
!
commit
Right after the system configuration is committed, the cEdge contacts the vBond for authentication and starts to build control connections to vManage and vSmarts.
CSR1000V and C8000V Activation
cEdge virtual routers require an extra step to associate a chassis and a token since they are not real hardware and the Universal Unique Device Identifier (UUDI) is virtual.
In vManage GUI navigate to: Configuration > Devices and locate an available CSR1000v or C8000v entry:
Run the activation and substitute the chassis and serial numbers in the command.
request platform software sdwan vedge_cloud activate chassis-number CHASSIS_NUMBER token TOKEN_ID  
Example:
Router# request platform software sdwan vedge_cloud activate chassis-number 7AD5C8CE-301E-4DA8-A74E-90A316XXXXXX token 23ffdf400cb14e489332a74b8fXXXXXX
Control Connections Verification
Verify the state of the control connections with the verification commands.
show sdwan control connections
show sdwan control connection-history
