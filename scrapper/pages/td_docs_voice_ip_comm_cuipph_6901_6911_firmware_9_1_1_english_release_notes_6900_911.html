New and Changed Information
This section contains the following topics:
•Automatic Port Synchronization
•Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express Support
•CUCM SIP Endpoint Support
•Device Un-registration
•iLBC Support
•K-Factor (MOS)
•Plus Dialing
•Secure Monitoring and Recording
•SIP firmware support for Cisco Unified Video Advantage

Automatic Port Synchronization
When the Cisco Unified Communication Manager administrator uses the Remote Port Configuration feature to set the speed and duplex function of an IP phone remotely, loss of packets can occur, if one port is slower than the other.
The Automatic Port Synchronization feature synchronizes the ports to the lowest speed among the two ports, which eliminates packet loss. When automatic port synchronization is enabled, it is recommended that both ports be configured for autonegotiate. If one port is enabled for autonegotiate and the other is at a fixed speed, the phone synchronizes to the fixed port speed.
Note If both the ports are configured for fixed speed, the Automatic Port Synchronization feature is ineffective.
Note The Remote Port Configuration and Automatic Port Synchronization features are compatible only with IEEE 802.3AF Power of Ethernet (PoE) switches.
Note Switches that support only Cisco Inline Power are not compatible. Enabling this feature on phones that are connected to these types of switches could result in loss of connectivity to Cisco Unified CM, if the phone is powered by PoE.
Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express Support
Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express supports the following IP phones:
•Cisco Unified IP Phone 6901
•Cisco Unified IP Phone 6911
CUCM SIP Endpoint Support
The Cisco Unified IP Phones 6901 and 6911 SIP products will use the same portable SIP call features and SIP messaging stack that runs on the rest of the Cisco SIP Phones. Since the same software is used, the Cisco Unified IP Phones 6901 and 6911 SIP will get all the signaling and call feature flow behaviors that are compliant with Cisco UCM SIP line side specification.
Device Un-registration
The phone implements a new alarm that is sent in at the time of registration reporting diagnostic information related to the current and previous registration events, as well as, the previous deregistration event. Once the new alarm is implemented the phones, utilizing SCCP, should discontinue sending the StationAlarm message that was previously sent at the time of registration. For reference this is the alarm that includes the "Last=" string. Since this alarm is sent prior to protocol version negotiation it is understood that the newer versions of phone software always sends the newly defined StationEnhancedAlarmMessage. The older versions of the Cisco Unified Communication Manager ignores and discard the new alarm.
iLBC Support
iLBC stands for internet low bit rate codec. It is a royalty free narrow band (8kHz sampling) speech codec supporting bit rate15.2kbps for 20ms - 38 bytes frames. In terms of quality, it compares with G.729a with the added advantage of frame independence.
iLBC has it own built-in packet loss concealment but it does not have a built-in silence suppression scheme.
K-Factor (MOS)
K-factor is a Cisco proprietary MOS-LQK listening quality metric measurement. It is part of the Voice Quality Metric set and is provided with other VQ values on the phone UI, web interface and other reports.
Note K-factor should not be used as a basis for Service Level Agreement (SLA) and instead Concealed Seconds type metrics should be used.
K-factor is voice codec dependent and interfaces closely with the device de-jitter buffer. The supported codec in its current version are G.711, G.729, G.729a, G.729ab and iLBC.
Plus Dialing
In this release, users can now press and hold the "*" key for 1 second to add a plus "+" sign as the first digit in a phone number for international dialing.
These Cisco Unified IP Phones support this feature:
•Cisco Unified IP Phone 6901
•Cisco Unified IP Phone 6911
Secure Monitoring and Recording
Secure Recording and Monitoring feature supports encryption of the recording and monitoring audio streams and the control signaling. A supervisor using encrypted phone will be available to monitor an agent who is using an encrypted phone or an agent who is using an unsecured phone.
A recorder connected to Cisco Unified Communication Manager through secure SIP trunk using sRTP will be available to record an agent who is using an encrypted phone or an agent who is using an unsecured phone.
However, CUCM does not allow monitoring or recording session to downgrade the overall security of the original call. Therefore, the media for those sessions have to guarantee to be the same or higher security than the agent phone's security capability.
Note This feature applies only to Cisco Unified IP Phone 6911 and supports only Secure Monitoring and non-secure Recording.
SIP firmware support for Cisco Unified Video Advantage
The Cisco Audio Session Tunnel (CAST) protocol establishes communication between the Cisco Unified Video Advantage (CUVA) and Cisco Unified IP Phones (SIP), which enables the CUVA to support video on the PC even if the IP phone does not have video capability.When implemented on SIP phones, the CAST protocol enables communication with video applications when the PC is connected to the PC port on the phone.
Note This feature applies only to Cisco Unified IP Phone 6911.
Where to Find More Information
Cisco Unified IP Phone 6901 and 6911 Administration Guide for Cisco Unified Communications Manager 8.5.
Whisper Coaching
Silent call monitoring is a feature that allows a supervisor to discreetly listen to a conversation between an agent and a customer without allowing the agent to detect the monitoring session. Whisper coaching is an enhancement to silent call monitoring feature that allows supervisors to talk to agents during a monitoring session. This feature provides applications the ability to change the current monitoring mode of a monitoring call from Silent Monitoring to Whisper Coaching and vice versa.
To enable Whisper Coaching in the Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration application, choose Device > Phone, locate the Cisco Unified IP Phone that you want to configure. Scroll to the Device Information Layout pane and set Built-in Bridge to On or Default. If Built-in Bridge is set to Default, in the Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration application, choose System > Service Parameter and select the appropriate Server and Service. Scroll to the Clusterwide Parameters (Device - Phone) pane and set Built-in Bridge Enable to On.

Resetting or Restoring the Cisco Unified IP Phone
There are two general methods for resetting or restoring the Cisco Unified IP Phone:
•Performing a Basic Reset
•Performing a Factory Reset
Performing a Basic Reset
Performing a basic reset of a Cisco Unified IP Phone provides a way to recover if the phone experiences an error and provides a way to reset or restore various configuration and security settings.
Table 2 describes the ways to perform a basic reset. You can reset a phone with any of these operations after the phone has started up. Choose the operation that is appropriate for your situation.
Table 2 Basic Reset Methods 
Operation
Performing
Explanation
Restart phone
Unplug the power cable and plug it back in.
Resets any user and network configuration changes that you have made, but that the phone has not written to its Flash memory, to previously saved settings, then restarts the phone.
Reset Settings
Reset the phone to its factory settings.
Resets user and network configuration settings to their default values, and restarts the phone.

Performing a Factory Reset
When you perform a factory reset of the Cisco Unified IP Phone, the following information is erased or reset to its default value:
•User configuration settings—Reset to default values
•Network configuration settings—Reset to default values
•Call histories—Erased
•Locale information—Reset to default values
•Phone application—Erased (phone recovers by using the image in the inactive partition of flash to boot up).
Before you perform a factory reset, ensure that the following conditions are met:
•The phone must be on a DHCP-enabled network.
•A valid TFTP server must be set in DHCP option 150 or option 66 on the DHCP server.
To perform a factory reset of a phone, you can use the IVR to reset the network settings to factory default or you can perform the following steps:
