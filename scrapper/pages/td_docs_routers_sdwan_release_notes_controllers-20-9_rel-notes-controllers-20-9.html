Cisco SD-WAN's Lawful Intercept feature enables Cisco vManage and Cisco vSmart controller to provide the key information to LEA so they can decrypt the Cisco SD-WAN IPsec traffic captured by the MSP.
Cisco SD-WAN Security
Cisco SD-WAN Identity-Based Firewall Policy
This feature allows you to configure user-identity-based firewall policies for unified security policies.
Cisco Identity Services Engine and Microsoft Active Directory Services are identity providers to authenticate and authorize device users in the network. When Cisco vManage and a Cisco vSmart controller establish a connection to the Cisco Identity Services Engine, information about user and user groups—that is, identity-mapping information—is retrieved from the Cisco Identity Services Engine. Identity-based policies are then distributed to Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. This identity mapping information is used while creating firewall policies.
Automatic GRE Tunnels to Zscaler
With this feature, use the Secure Internet Gateway (SIG) feature template to provision automatic GRE tunnels to Zscaler SIGs. In earlier releases, the SIG template only supported the provisioning of automatic IPSec tunnels to Zscaler SIGs.
Global SIG Credentials Template
With this feature, create a single global Cisco SIG Credentials template for each SIG provider (Cisco Umbrella or Zscaler). When you attach a Cisco SIG template to a device template, Cisco vManage automatically attaches the applicable global Cisco SIG Credentials template to the device template.

This feature adds support for the following Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) dialer interfaces: PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE), PPP over Asynchronous Transfer Mode (PPPoA), and PPP over Ethernet Asynchronous Transfer Mode (PPPoEoA).
You can use the PPP dialer interfaces to access IPv4 services and sites.
Support for Static NAT Mapping with HSRP
With this feature, if both the Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) routers are configured with the same static NAT mapping, only the active device responds to the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) request for a static NAT mapping entry. Traffic that fails over from the HSRP active device to the standby device does not have to wait for the ARP request to time out before failing over.
ALG Support for NAT DIA and Zone-Based Firewalls
This feature provides support for an application-level gateway (ALG) that translates the IP address inside the payload of an application packet. Specific protocols such as Domain Name System (DNS), FTP, and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) require a NAT ALG for translation of the IP addresses and port numbers in the packet payload.
Support for Port Forwarding with NAT DIA
With this feature, you can define one or more port-forwarding rules to send packets received on a particular port from an external network to reach devices on an internal network.
Prior to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.9.1a and Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1, port forwarding was available for service-side NAT only.
Support for NAT High-Speed Logging
This feature provides the ability to enable or disable high-speed logging (HSL) of all translations by NAT.
The new ip nat log translations flow-export command is introduced.
You can configure NAT HSL using a device CLI or a CLI add-on template.
Cisco SD-WAN Multi-Region Fabric (also Hierarchical SD-WAN)
Re-Origination Dampening
In networks experiencing instability, TLOCs and bidirectional forwarding detection (BFD) tunnels may cycle repeatedly between being available and unavailable. This causes the overlay management protocol (OMP) to repeatedly withdraw and re-originate routes. This churn adversely affects Cisco vSmart controller performance.
Adding a delay before re-originating routes that have gone down repeatedly prevents excessive churn, and prevents this type of network instability from diminishing Cisco vSmart controller performance.
Migrating to Multi-Region Fabric
Cisco SD-WAN Multi-Region Fabric provides a migration mode to facilitate migrating an enterprise network to Cisco SD-WAN. Migration mode enables a stepwise transition of devices from Cisco vSmart controllers that are not part of a Multi-Region Fabric network to Cisco vSmart controllers operating in a Multi-Region Fabric architecture.
The migration mode is useful for migrating complex networks that function similarly to a Multi-Region Fabric architecture—that is, they have multiple network segments, and have a control policy that directs inter-segmental traffic through network hubs.
Match Traffic by Destination Region
When creating an application route policy or data policy, you can match traffic according to its destination region. The destination may be a device in the same primary region, the same secondary region, or neither of these.
Specify Path Type Preference
When configuring a centralized policy, you can create a preferred color group list, which specifies three levels of route preference, called primary, secondary and tertiary. The route preferences are based on TLOC color and, optionally, on the path type—direct tunnel, multi-hop path, or all paths. Path type is relevant to networks using Multi-Region Fabric.
