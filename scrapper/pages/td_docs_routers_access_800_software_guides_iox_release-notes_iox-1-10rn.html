Overview
Cisco IOx provides uniform and consistent hosting capabilities for various types of apps across Cisco platforms. This platform brings together Cisco IOS, the industry-leading networking operating system, and Linux, the leading open source platform. Linux-based applications can run on Cisco devices in the Cisco IOx framework, so using this platform, you can bring custom applications and interfaces to the network.
With Cisco IOx, developers can create a wide variety of IoT apps, such as data aggregation system and control systems.
New Features in this Release
This release provides new features, including the following:
Cisco Fog Director
–Amber app signed status icon—This new icon indicates that an app is signed but the signature verification with a developer certificate and the developer certificate verification with a Certificate Authority will occur during installation of the app on a device.
–TCP port mapping—Configuration fields that display depend on the package.yaml file for an app, and can include fields for configuring a single port and a range of ports.
–UDP port mapping—Configuration fields that display depend on the package.yaml file for an app, and can include fields for configuring a single port and a range of ports.
–Mirroring—You can enable port mirroring for an app if supported by the app and device.
–VLAN ID—You can configure a VLAN on which an internal network operates.
–Dynamic addition/removal of network interfaces—You can add network interfaces during app install or edit workflow. The total number of interfaces can be a maximum of three unless the package.yaml file for the app asks for more than three interfaces, in which case you can configure as many as that file asks for. You can also remove the dynamically added network interfaces but not the interfaces asked by the package.yaml.
Cisco Local Manager
–Mirroring—You can enable port mirroring for an app if supported by the app and host system.
–VLAN ID—You can configure a VLAN on which an internal network operate.

Note: App files that should persist when the app container reboots should be uploaded to the /data directory for that app. You can use Cisco Local Manager, Cisco Fog Director, or an SSH connection to upload the files.
Limitations and Restrictions
Upgrades of platform images must be performed from n -1’ to n release only ( n = the latest release).
If CAF crashes abruptly, CAF comes back up with limited functionality. If app management services are down you can download the tech support logs and verify the reason from the CAF logs or in syslog files. An example for app management going down is a CAF abrupt crash.
The workaround is to reboot the device. If the app management services are down after the device reboots, collect the tech support logs from the device before contacting the support team.
App asking for multiple USB ports and devices is not supported. This restriction applies only to FD.
USB device hot swap-out and swap-in are not supported. You must plug in the USB device before installation the application on the IOx device.
Caveats
You can use the Bug Search Tool to find information about caveats, including a description of the problems and available workarounds. The Bug Search Tool lists both open and resolved caveats.
