Defect Information

Defect ID Headline
CSCvs82926 Critical RPM alert on FPR1000 and FPR2100 Series with ASA 'Chassis 0 Cooling Fan OK' SCH m

Problem Description

Some releases of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software might incorrectly report a critical revolutions per minute (RPM) fan alert on Cisco Secure Firewall Firepower 1100 (FPR1100) and Firepower 2100 (FPR2100) Series security appliances.

Background

For Cisco Secure Firewall FPR1100 and FPR2100 Series security appliances, some releases of Cisco ASA Software might incorrectly report a critical RPM fan alert. This issue might also create a Smart Call Home (SCH) message that results in a Cisco support case.
Note: Only Cisco Secure Firewall FPR1120, FPR1140, FPR1150, FPR2110, and FPR2120 are affected by the issue that is described in this field notice.
For information on the fan operating condition, see the Cisco Firepower 1100 Series Hardware Installation Guide and the Cisco Firepower 2100 Series Hardware Installation Guide for the appropriate security appliance.
For information on the SCH feature, see the Cisco Secure Firewall ASA Series General Operations CLI Configuration Guide for the appropriate release of Cisco ASA Software.
For information on fan troubleshooting commands, see the FXOS Troubleshooting Commands section of the Cisco FXOS Troubleshooting Guide for the appropriate security appliance.

Problem Symptom

The security appliance displays RPM - Critical followed by a chassis Cooling Fan 0: Failure Detected message. An SCH message that results in a Cisco support case might also be created.
The following example shows that the show environment command displays the RPM - Critical alert, but the Cooling Fan 0 shows a status of OK:
ciscoasa# show environment

Fan 1: 5280 RPM - Critical
 
Syslog data:

Note: The FAN status LED on the front panel of the security appliance will remain green during the error condition to indicate that the fans are operating normally.

Workaround/Solution

A Return Material Authorization (RMA) of the affected security appliance is not required for this issue.
Cisco recommends upgrading to one of the fixed releases shown in the following table:
