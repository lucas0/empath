Installation of Plastic Shims on the Cisco RF Gateway 10 Guide Rails
1 Attaching Plastic Shims on the Cisco RFGW-10 Guide Rails
The Cisco RF Gateway 10 (RFGW-10) Universal Edge Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (UEQAM) has two guide rails. These guide rails are located inside the chassis where the fan assembly is seated.
Plastic shims are used to reduce the alignment between the guide rails and the fan assembly. It is recommend that you use the plastic shims available in the Cisco RFGW-10 accessory kit on the guide rails.
Warning Only trained and qualified personnel should be allowed to install, replace, or service this equipment. Statement 1030.
Required Tools and Equipment
•Plastic shims (PN 700-39090-01), provided in the Cisco RFGW-10 accessory kit
•Alcohol to clean the guide rails
•ESD-preventive wrist strap
•Antistatic mat or static-shielding bag
•Screwdriver
Steps
To attach the plastic shims on the guide rails of the Cisco RFGW-10 chassis:
Step 1 Power off the Cisco RFGW-10 by turning off the main power switch.
Step 2 Use the screwdriver to loosen the three captive installation screws on the front panel of the fan assembly by turning them counterclockwise.
Step 3 Grasp the fan assembly handles with both hands and pull it outward to disengage the midplane connector. Slide it out of the chassis and place it in a safe place. For more information, see Removing the Fan Assembly section in the Cisco RF Gateway 10 Hardware Installation Guide.
Caution Never operate the system for more than three minutes when the fan assembly is removed. An over-temperature condition can cause severe equipment damage.
Step 4 Clean both the guide rails thoroughly with alcohol, and allow it to dry.
Step 5 Remove the protective liner from the plastic shim by lifting one corner of the liner. See Figure 1.

Step 6 Align the plastic strips (one strip per rail) flush with the bottom and the end edges of the guide rails. Affix the strips firmly on to the guide rails. See Figure 2.
Note The end edge rail is the rail closest to the mid-plane of the chassis.
Note If you want to remove the attached shims from the rail, lift one end of the shim with a blade screwdriver, hold it with pliers, and pull it off the rail.

Step 7 Install the fan assembly by placing it into the bay so that it rests on the chassis, and then lift the fan assembly up slightly, aligning the top and sides with the bay opening.
Step 8 Gently slide the fan assembly into the chassis until the front panel of the fan tray makes contact with the chassis.
Step 9 Tighten the captive screws on the fan assembly by turning them clockwise, with an installation torque of 6-8 in-lbs.
Step 10 Verify the fan assembly installation by listening for the fans; you should immediately hear them operating. If you do not hear them, ensure that the fan assembly is inserted completely in the chassis, and that the faceplate is flush with the chassis back panel. The fan tray LED should illuminate green.
Step 11 Power on the Cisco RFGW-10 by energizing the facility DC power feeds to the power supply. Verify power supply operation by checking the front panel LEDs on the DC PEM modules. The -48 V1 and -48 V2 LEDs should illuminate green.
Step 12 Switch the circuit breaker switch to the On (|) position. For more information, see Powering On the Cisco RFGW-10 UEQAM section in the Cisco RF Gateway 10 Hardware Installation Guide.
