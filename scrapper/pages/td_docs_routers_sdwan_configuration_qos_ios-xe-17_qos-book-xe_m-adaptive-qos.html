Adaptive QoS
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1
This feature enables WAN interface shapers and per-tunnel shapers at the enterprise edge to adapt to the available WAN bandwidth. The capability to adapt to the bandwidth controls differentiated packet drops at the enterprise edge and reduces or prevents packet drops in the network core.

Limitations and Restrictions
Adaptive QoS is only supported on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. Only Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices can be configured as hub devices. This means that for adaptive QoS to work, the spokes should also be Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
Adaptive QoS is only supported on to hub-to-spoke network topology.
Adaptive QoS support on DIA/DCA interfaces is dependent upon the throughput of the overlay session.
If an edge device is configured as hub, the WAN interface on the edge device cannot be configured with adaptive QoS.
Adaptive QoS is supported for loopback interfaces only when a single loopback interface is bound to a single physical interface.

Workflow of Adaptive QoS
Overview of Adaptive QoS
Enterprise networks are increasingly using the Internet as a form of WAN transport. Therefore, QoS models need to adapt accordingly. QoS works effectively when deployed in a service-level agreement (SLA) environment, like Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks. The available bandwidth on the Internet at a given time can vary. It can often be much lesser than the actual bandwidth that is offered by the service provider. In a non-SLA environment, QoS has limitations because it can't predict the changing bandwidth on the link.
With adaptive QoS, the shapers at the edge of the enterprise (WAN interface shaper and per-tunnel shaper) can adapt to the available WAN bandwidth, both Internet and Long-term Evolution (LTE). Thus, adaptive QoS can control differentiated drops at the enterprise edge and reduce the packet drops in the Internet core. When the adaptive QoS capability is not available, shapers that are applied as part of the egress QoS policy are static in value. They are configured based on the service provider bandwidth offering and don't change with time, thus they don’t reflect the actual available Internet bandwidth.
Benefits of Adaptive QoS
Adjusts the shaper parameters based on the actual available Internet bandwidth in both directions, which is periodically computed
Allows configuring a QoS policy on the spoke towards the hub
Ensures better control of application performance at the enterprise edge even when the bandwidth fluctuates
Allows aggregate tunnel shape adaptation to provide effective bandwidth between spoke and hub
How Adaptive QoS Works in Cisco SD-WAN
LTE and Internet bandwidth changes dynamically based on weather conditions and external parameters. In addition, Internet bandwidth can also fluctuate with the network conditions of the service provider, their congestion, and configurations.
Application traffic is prone to packet drops at the Internet core when the bandwidth is less, and the traffic can't be differentiated by user-defined priority. In such scenarios, Cisco SD-WAN adaptive QoS automatically updates the shaper rate in real time based on the Internet and LTE link bandwidth.
Adaptive QoS can be enabled through Cisco vManage on a specific interface of an edge device that is configured with the spoke role in a hub-to-spoke network topology. You can specify minimum, maximum, and default values. You can also configure a timer interval at a global level on a WAN interface to measure the drop rates.
In the image, adaptive per-tunnel QoS is configured on the WAN interfaces of the spoke devices (Branch 1 and Branch 2) through Cisco vManage with the following configurations:

Data Center
In the image, the per-tunnel QoS on the hub device in the data center reflects the downstream bandwidth configured on the spoke devices in Branch 1 and Branch 2.
Adaptive QoS in Cisco SD-WAN is based on an algorithm based on packet drop or loss that works as follows:
Traffic Behavior
Analysis and Corresponding Adaptive QoS Behavior
No drops on the WAN or shapers
Shaper rate is not adjusted because the user traffic rate is low
Packet Drops in WAN
WAN bandwidth is oversubscribed. The shaper rate is thus adjusted to go DOWN to avoid packet drops.
Packet Drops in Shapers
A drop in shapers without packet drops in WAN indicates that the available WAN bandwidth is not being utilized; and therefore, the shaper rate is adjusted to go UP.
Workflow of Adaptive QoS
When the adapt period is configured, adaptive QoS follows these stages.
Adapt: This is the initial stage where the shaping rate is based on the default value or is recalculated based on the last cycle.
Measure: In this stage, shaper or WAN loss metrics are calculated. A single adapt cycle can have multiple loss measurement cycles.
Verify or Recalculate: This stage verifies whether the shaper rate works as expected. Based on both the shaper rate and WAN loss rate, the drop-based algorithm is used to calculate the appropriate shaping rate for the next cycle.
Configure Adaptive QoS
To configure adaptive QoS use the Cisco VPN template for one of the following interfaces: Ethernet, Cellular, or DSL.
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Templates.
Click Feature Templates and then click Add Template.

Note
In Cisco vManage Release 20.7.x and earlier releases, Feature Templates is called Feature.
Choose a device from the list on the left. Feature templates that are applicable to the device are shown in the right pane.
Choose one of the available Cisco VPN Interface templates. In this example, we've chosen the Cisco VPN Interface Ethernet template.
Enter a name and description for the feature template.
Click ACL/QoS.
Notice that Adaptive QoS is disabled by default. To enable it, from the Adaptive QoS drop-down list, choose Global, and choose On.
(Optional) Enter adaptive QoS parameters. You can leave the additional details at as default or specify your values.
Adapt Period: Choose Global from the drop-down list, click On, and enter the period in minutes.
Shaping Rate Upstream: Choose Global from the drop-down list, click On, and enter the minimum, maximum, and default upstream bandwidth in Kbps.
Shaping Rate Downstream: Choose Global from the drop-down list, click On, and enter the minimum, maximum, downstream, and upstream bandwidth in Kbps.
Click Save.
Attach the feature template to a device template.

How the Adaptive QoS Algorithm Works
With adaptive QoS, the QoS shaper rate is adjusted based on WAN loss and local network loss. WAN and local network loss are measured based on the IPSec or GRE sequence number in the overlay session. The adaptive QoS algorithm brings the QoS shaper rate DOWN when WAN loss crosses the configured threshold. The algorithm brings the QoS shaper rate UP when the local network loss is detected to be over the threshold.
The adaptive QoS algorithm consists of the following parameters.
Table 4.
Parameter
Default Value
Customizable
Adaptive QoS Behavior
WAN loss threshold
0.2%
Yes
If the WAN loss detected is above the threshold, the shaper rate adapts DOWN.
Spoke overlay traffic threshold
40%
Yes
The QoS shaper rate for a spoke adapts UP or DOWN only when the overlay user traffic out of the overall traffic is above the threshold.
Local loss threshold
0.1%
No
If only local loss detected is above the threshold (WAN loss is still within the threshold), and the traffic throughput crosses a certain usage threshold, the shaper rate adapts UP.
Pre-adapting UP overlay user traffic threshold
90%
No
When both WAN and local loss are below the threshold, and the overlay user traffic usage of the QoS shaper is above the threshold, the QoS shaper rate adapts UP.
Hub adapting UP overlay user traffic usage threshold
90%
No
When only local loss is above the threshold, and the QoS shaper rate for and the overlay user traffic is above the threshold, the QoS shaper rate adapts UP. This behavior prevents adapting if there is congestion on the parent schedulers.
Adapting Stride
Minimum: 1%
Maximum: current QoS shaper rate
No
The QoS shaper rate adapts UP if the normal stride is 1/10 of the QoS shaper rate range.
The QoS shaper rate adapts DOWN based on the normal stride in the shaper rate and WAN loss rate.
Customize Adaptive QoS Thresholds
The following parameters in the adaptive QoS algorithm can be customized.
WAN loss threshold:
Use the platform qos sdwan adapt wan-loss-permillage <1~999 permillage> through the configuration mode of the device CLI or using the CLI add-on feature template in Cisco vManage.
Spoke overlay traffic percentage:
Use the platform qos sdwan adapt spoke-overlay-usage <1~100 percent> through the configuration mode of the device CLI or using the CLI add-on feature template in Cisco vManage.
