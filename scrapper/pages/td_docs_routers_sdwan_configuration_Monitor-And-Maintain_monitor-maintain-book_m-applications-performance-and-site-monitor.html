Configure Application Performance and Site Monitoring Using Cisco vManage
You can enable application performance and site monitoring using Cisco vManage by configuring Performance Monitoring under System Profile in a configuration group. Configure the parameters in Application Performance Monitoring tab to enable monitoring. For more information see, Performance Monitoring Feature Configuration.
The application performance and site monitoring feature needs NBAR to be enabled on all LAN interfaces for application recognition.
If Application-Aware Routing (AAR) policy is configured then NBAR is automatically enabled. If AAR policy is not configured, then NBAR must be enabled on all LAN interfaces using a CLI add-on template. Use the ip nbar protocol-discovery configuration to enable NBAR on all LAN interfaces.
Performance Monitoring
Performance Monitoring
Using Cisco vManage, you can monitor the performance of applications.
For each parameter of the feature that has a default value, the scope is set to Default (indicated by a check mark), and the default setting or value is shown. To change the default or to enter a value, click the scope drop-down list to the left of the parameter field and choose Global:
Parameter Scope
Scope Description
Global (indicated by a globe icon)
Enter a value for the parameter, and apply that value to all devices.
Examples of parameters that you might apply globally to a group of devices are DNS server, syslog server, and interface MTUs.
The following tables describe the options for configuring the Performance Monitoring feature.
Field
Description
Type
Choose a feature from the drop-down list.
Feature Name
Enter a name for the feature. The name can be up to 128 characters and can contain only alphanumeric characters.
Description
Enter a description of the feature. The description can be up to 2048 characters and can contain only alphanumeric characters.
Application Performance Monitoring
Field
Description
Monitoring
To enable monitoring, check the check box. You can enable monitoring only in Global mode.
Enabling monitoring displays a list of application groups. Fourteen application groups are enabled by default. You can disable or enable more applications based on your requirements. Check the check box adjacent to an application group to enable monitoring.
Underlay Measurement Track Service
Field
Description
Monitoring
Click Monitoring drop-down list, and choose Global to trace tunnel paths regularly according to a configured time interval.
Click the toggle button to enable the continous monitoring option in UMTS.
Monitoring Interval (Minutes)
In the Monitoring Interval (Minutes) field, choose a time.
This option enables you to monitor exact path at a specific time period.
Event Driven
Click the Event Driven drop-down list, and choose Global to trace tunnel paths when triggered by one of the events as per the event type.
Event Type
Click the Event Type drop-down list, and choose an event type. The event types are:
SLA Change: Change in the service-level agreement (SLA) parameter for the tunnel.
PMTU Change: Change in the Path MTU (PMTU) parameter for the tunnel.
To save the configuration, click Save.
Configure Application Performance and Site Monitoring Using a CLI Add-on Template
You can enable application performance monitor using the CLI Add-on feature template in Cisco vManage. For more information see, Application Performance Monitoring.
If Application-Aware Routing (AAR) policy is configured then NBAR is automatically enabled. If AAR policy is not configured, then NBAR must be enabled on all LAN interfaces using a CLI add-on template. Use the ip nbar protocol-discovery configuration to enable NBAR on all LAN interfaces.
The following example shows the application performance monitoring configuration.

All Sites and Single Site View
All Applications All Sites View
The default setting for the applications window is the all sites view. You can view information for all sites by clicking the All Sites button on the top of the page, and clicking the radio button next to All Sites.
The all sites view displays information for all applications of all sites for the last one hour.
In the table, the Health column shows the application health. Place the cursor over the icon in the column to display Good, Fair, or Poor health status. The health of the application is measured by Quality of Experience (QoE).
Click the toggle button to switch to the application heatmap view.
In the heatmap view, the grid of colored squares displays the application health as Good, Fair, or Poor. You can hover over a square or click it to display additional details of an application at a specific time and click View details to view specific application details. Click the time interval drop-down list to change the time interval.
All Applications Single Site View
You can also view the health of all the applications on a single site. To enter single site view, click the All Sites button on the top of the page, and click the radio button next to Single Site to select the site of interest.
Single Application All Site View
For a single application on all sites, click a specific Site ID to navigate to single site monitoring. Click the application name to view further application specific details.
Single Application Single Site View
For a single application on a single site, a line graph shows the application health over a period of time. Select the time from the drop-down list to select 1, 3, 6, 12, or 24 hours. The table displays a list of paths that has processed application traffic over a time period. Select individual paths and view the individual QoE lines on the line graph. At a time five paths can be selected, and five line charts are displayed. You can also drag the top handles to focus on a particular point in time. When you change the time, the table automatically refreshes to show the health information for that time interval.
View Application Health in Table View
The Application Health window displays the following in table view:
All applications for all sites: A selected list of applications that are enabled using the performance monitoring feature or the CLI add-on template from all the sites.
All applications for a single site: A selected list of applications that are enabled using the performance monitoring feature or the CLI add-on template from a single site.
All the sites of a single application: All the sites of a selected application that is enabled using the performance monitoring feature or the CLI add-on template, sorted by the status in the health column.
In the table, the Health column shows the application health. Place the cursor over the icon in the column to display Good, Fair, or Poor health status. The health of the application is measured by QoE.
Click the application name to view further application specific details. For a single application on all sites, click a specific Site ID to navigate to single site monitoring.
Click the toggle button to switch to application heatmap view.
View Application Health in Heatmap View
The Application Health window displays the following in heatmap view:
All applications for all sites: A list of all applications health for different time selections.
All applications for a single site: A selected list of applications that are enabled using the performance monitoring feature or the CLI add-on template from a single site.
All the sites of a single application: A list of sites and health of each site at different time intervals for a single application.
In the heatmap view, the grid of colored squares displays the application health as Good, Fair, or Poor. You can hover over a square or click it to display the additional details of an application at a specific time and click View details to view specific application details. Click the time interval drop-down list to change the time interval.
Click the Toggle button to switch to the application table view.
