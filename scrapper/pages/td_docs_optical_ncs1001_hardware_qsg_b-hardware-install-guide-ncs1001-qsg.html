Cisco NCS 1001 Overview
Cisco NCS 1001 (NCS1001-K9) is 1 RU chassis that addresses the growing bandwidth needs of data center DWDM applications. It provides a DWDM line system that is optimized for data center environments and is optimized for point-to-point applications at maximum capacity. NCS 1001 supports up to three optical modules. The modules can be amplifiers or protection switching modules.
NCS 1001 has the following components:
Removable control card
Four removable fans
Two removable 600W AC/DC or DC/DC power supply modules (PSU)
Three slots for optical modules. Two Optical Amplifier Modules ( NCS1K-EDFA) and a Protection Switching Module (NCS1K-PSM) can be inserted in these slots.
The optical modules can be inserted in slots 1 to 3 as shown in the following figure. The optical modules can be inserted and removed from the slots while the system is operational. In amplified configuration, the Optical Amplifier module can be inserted in any slot. In (section) protected configuration, the protect Optical Amplifier module is inserted in slot 1, Protection Switching Module in slot 2, and working Optical Amplifier module in slot 3.

Caution
Each optical module must be inserted in a slot only when the module in the adjacent slot is completely inserted and seated or the adjacent slot is empty. If an optical module is inserted in a slot without seating the adjacent module, the ejector might interfere with the adjacent module.

Caution
The empty slots must be inserted with the filler optical modules or filler PSUs as appropriate to guarantee safety and system cooling compliance. See Figure 1 and Figure 3 to identify the slots for optical modules and PSUs respectively.

Install NCS 1001-K9 into EIA/ANSI Rack
In an EIA/ANSI rack, NCS 1001 can be installed in the front position.

Note
The rack is not provided by Cisco. Cisco provides only the chassis and the sliding rail.

Caution
Use only the fastening hardware provided with NCS 1001-K9 to prevent loosening, deterioration, and electromechanical corrosion of the hardware and joined material.
It is required to have 100 mm (3.94") space on the front and rear side of the rack to provide sufficient clearance for cable routing and cooling of the system.
In case of a closed cabinet, the cabinet must support the thermal management or front/rear doors need to have 70% perforation. Closed cabinets must have adequate airflow to dissipate maximum power from equipments in a fully-equipped cabinet.
NCS 1001-K9 shall be installed maintaining a minimum clearance of 5mm above and below the chassis.
Before You Begin
Ensure the rack is compatible. See the Rack Comatibility section.
Procedure
Step 1   Identify and attach the sliding edge for the 2/4 post rack.
Step 2   Attach the sliding rail and L bracket to the left and right of the chassis using the screws (48-0471-01 and 48-2406-01) and tighten them to a torque value of 0.65 N-m (5.9 in-lbs) for 48-0471-01 screws and torque value of 1.5 N-m (13.25 in-lbs) for 48-2406-01 screws.

Step 3   Fix the Grounding extender to the chassis with the screws (48-1142-01) and tighten them to a torque value of 2.5 - 3.4 N-m (22.0 - 30.0 in-lbs).
Note   
The grounding extender must be assembled before installing NCS 1001 into the rack.

Step 5   Insert the chassis onto the sliding rail assembled on the two or four post 19" or 23" rack.
It is recommended to assemble the empty chassis to the rack for easy handling.

Step 6   As soon as the chassis is completely inserted, fasten the chassis with two screws (48-101524-01) on each side of the bracket and tighten them to a torque value of 3.4 N-m (30 in-lbs).
Caution   
The sliding rail must be used only during the first mounting process and it serves only to push the chassis into the rack and not for sliding purpose. The chassis must be fixed with screws on the front side.

When terminating the frame ground, do not use soldering lug connectors, screwless (push-in) connectors, quick connect connectors, or other friction-fit connectors.
Procedure
Step 1   Verify that the office ground cable is connected to the top of the rack and the office ground, according to local site practice.
Step 2   Remove any paint and other nonconductive coatings from the surfaces between the shelf ground and bay frame ground point. Clean the mating surfaces and apply appropriate antioxidant compound to the bare conductors.
Step 3   Attach one end of the shelf ground cable (#8 AWG cable) to the ground point using the specified dual-hole lug connector. See Figure 3.

Power Supply
NCS 1001 has two slots for 600W AC redundant Power Supply Units (PSU). It is sufficient to have a single PSU inserted in the chassis to support all the features and provide power to all the pluggable modules. When only one PSU is inserted in the chassis, the Power Module Redundancy Lost major alarm is raised.

Caution
In case of single PSU, the other PSU slot must be inserted with the PSU filler module to guarantee safety and system cooling compliance.

Connect AC Power to NCS 1001

Caution
NCS 1001 relies on the protective devices in the building installation to protect against short circuit, overcurrent, and ground faults. Ensure that the protective devices comply with local and national electrical codes.
The voltage rating value for AC power ranges either between 200 V to 240 V or between 100 V to 127 V depending on the standards in various countries.

Note
A dual pole breaker is needed for the installation. The rating of the dual pole breaker is 16A for International and 20A for USA and Canada.
Figure 22. Hot Area on PSU Faceplate



Procedure
Step 1   Verify that the AC cable is installed in the correct AC source panel. Ensure that either the fuse is removed or the circuit breaker is in the off position and locked out.
Note   
For an AC power supply, fuse or breaker rating must not exceed 20A.
Step 2   Attach the AC power cable to the cable connector in the AC power module.
Step 3   Close the cable clamp to secure the power cable.
