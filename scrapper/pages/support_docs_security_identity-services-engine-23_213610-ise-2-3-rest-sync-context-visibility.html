Introduction
This document describes how to perform reset and sync of the Context Visibility on the ISE Distributed Deployment.
Problem
The procedure recommended to be performed if the Context Visibility GUI fails to load with error message `Unable to load Context Visibility page` or the Dashboard Counters are empty. A MAC address can also fail to be added with error "Unable to creaet the endpoint, Endpoint XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX already exists. This occurs when the Context Visibility database is out of sync with the Oracle database for that endpoint.
This document explains how to perform reset and sync of the Context Visibility in ISE distributed deployment to resolve these issues.
Solution
Connect via console or SSH to the Primary Administration Node (some output ommited for brevity), then perform application configure ise command, followed by option [20] Reset Context Visibility` and agreement to proceed y. Do not reply to the last question:
primary-node/admin# application configure ise

Selection configuration option
~
[20]Reset Context Visibility
[21]Synchronize Context Visibility With Database
~

20
This will remove all data from Context Visibility. Do you want to proceed [y/n]: y
Checking ISE persona
 - Done
Reset of indexing engine on this node needs to be run only after running it on Secondary Admin Node(secondary-node)
Is reset indexing engine started on Secondary Admin Node(secondary-node) [ Y/N ] :
With no reply to the last question open SSH or console to the Secondary Administration Node and perform command  application configure ise followed by option [20] Reset Context Visibility and agreement to proceed y, do not reply to the last question.
secondary-node/admin# application configure ise

Selection configuration option

[20]Reset Context Visibility
[21]Synchronize Context Visibility With Database

After the reset of the Context Visibility performed on both nodes, proceed with synchronization on the Primary Administration Node:
primary-node/admin# application configure ise

Selection configuration option
~
[20]Reset Context Visibility
[21]Synchronize Context Visibility With Database
~

21
This will synchronize Context Visibility with database. Do you want to proceed [y/n]: y
