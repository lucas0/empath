Predictable: Highly secure and predictable services that deliver business results and consistent experience. Cisco future proofs your investments with a partner you can trust.
When running your business operations on another company’s platform, you need a partner that puts your business first and ensure objectives are met and costs are managed.

We help you connect, secure, and automate, so you can accelerate your digital agility and deliver results.
Intelligent: Services that adapt to customer requirements using insights and automation to optimize use, resolve issues quickly and protect the business.

Cisco+ strategy
Q.  What is the Cisco+ Experience portal?
A.   As we continue to deliver on our as-a-service strategy, we will introduce the Cisco+ Experience in the near future. This is a self-service engagement portal that will simplify and facilitate the entire customer lifecycle experience. It will allow customers and partners to learn about, trial, consume, adopt, upgrade, and track usage of Cisco’s as-a-service portfolio. Customers transform from buying products and solutions to an end-to-end experience and outcomes with a flexible consumption model using this intuitive interface. Services can be easily ordered and quickly deployed on site by Cisco and our channel partners.
Q.  What is Cisco's vision for Network as-a-Service (NaaS)?
A.   Our vision for Cisco+ NaaS solutions is to combine our best-in-class networking, security, and observability capabilities into unified subscription services that are easy to consume and use, and more importantly, deliver an unparalleled experience.
Future Cisco+ offers will provide:
●     Seamless and secure on-ramps to applications and cloud providers
●     Full stack observability from the infrastructure to the application
●     Unified policy to ensure the right users have access to the right applications
●     Security integrated across everything, not bolted on as another point solution
●     IT optimization based on AI-driven insights to realize greater business benefit and improved ROI
●     Flexible delivery models, including usage-based, pay per use or pay as you grow options
●     Complete cloud-delivered solutions and management to solve the most challenging problems enterprises face today
●     Integrated hardware, software, and services with API extensibility that can be onboarded simply
●     Partners layering additional value-add functionality and delivering their services faster
On our journey to NaaS, we will initially focus on Cisco’s Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) architecture. Cisco will converge networking and security in the cloud with end-to-end observability from the user all the way to the application, over any cloud and any network. All core components of our SASE architecture will be available in a single offer, which will be orderable by mid-CY21. We will offer the flexibility to easily transition to a unified subscription service in the future.
Cisco SASE offer
Q.  What is included in the Cisco SASE offer?
A.   The Cisco SASE offer combines the core components of a SASE architecture, including:
●     Cloud security with Cisco Umbrella
●     SD-WAN powered by vManage or Meraki
●     Zero Trust Network Access with Cisco Secure Access powered by Duo
●     Observability with ThousandEyes
The Cisco SASE offer provides an easy way to purchase the complete Cisco SASE architecture today, with the ability to transition to a single subscription service in the future.
Q.  How are the Cisco SASE offer and a Cisco DNA Premier subscription different?
A.   The Cisco SASE offer is a more complete SASE offering than a Cisco DNA Premier subscription. While both include Cisco Umbrella and SD-WAN, only the Cisco SASE offer includes Zero Trust Network Access with Cisco Secure Access powered by Duo, and deep network performance visibility with ThousandEyes. The SASE offer provides more flexibility in taking advantage of Umbrella enhancement features (such as L7 CDFW and in the future options for DLP add on or SIG Advantage) and permits greater flexibility in selecting license quantities (Cisco DNA Premier offers fixed license counts). Additionally, the Cisco SASE offer is available with Meraki devices, where Cisco DNA Premier is not.
Q.  If I buy the Cisco SASE offer, what happens to my investment once the single subscription service becomes available?
A.   The Cisco SASE offer provides all of the core building blocks of a secure access service edge architecture today, making it easier than ever to begin your journey to SASE. This offer allows organizations to start using all of the core SASE components immediately. Cisco will look to include a built-in investment protection mechanism to support customer transition to the single subscription service, once available.
