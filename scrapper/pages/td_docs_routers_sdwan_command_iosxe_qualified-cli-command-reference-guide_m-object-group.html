Usage Guidelines
When Access Control Lists (ACLs) are configured using an FQDN, ACLs can be applied based on the destination domain name. The destination domain name is then resolved to an IP address, which is provided to the client as part of the DNS response.

Note
When defining a firewall rule in a security policy, avoid configuring an fqdn in both the source data prefix and the destination data prefix in the same firewall rule.
Create two different rules containing the following:
1st rule: Use fqdn in the source data prefix only.
2nd rule: Use fqdn in the destination data prefix only.
The following example shows how to create a new FQDN object group, obj.example.com:
Device (config)# object-group obj.example.com

Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.5.1a
Command qualified for use in Cisco SD-WAN Manager CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
Add object groups to use in Access Control Lists (ACLs) to enable geolocation-based firewall rules.

Note
When defining a firewall rule in a security policy, avoid configuring a geo in both the source data prefix and the destination data prefix in the same firewall rule.
Create two different rules containing the following:
1st rule: Use geo in the source data prefix only.
2nd rule: Use geo in the destination data prefix only.
The following example shows how to create a new object group GEO_1:
Device(config)# object-group geo GEO_1
object-group network
To define network object groups for use in object group-based access control lists (ACLs) and enter network group configuration mode, use the object-group network command in global configuration mode. To remove network object groups from the configuration, use the no form of this command.

Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco vManage CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
When you configure the object-group network command, the command mode changes to network group configuration mode (config-network-group) and allows you to populate or modify a network object-group ACL. The following command is available in network group configuration mode:
host {host-address }—Specifies the host object. You must use an IPv4 address for the host address.
Note the following restrictions:
You cannot associate an empty object group with an access control list (ACL).
If you use an object group with an ACL, you cannot empty or delete the object group. You can use Cisco SD-WAN Manager add-on feature templates to delete an attached ACL and its object group in the same template push, as long as there are no other references to the object group in the configuration. However, the commands will fail on the device. To avoid this, do not delete or empty an object group that is associated with an ACL.
For further usage guidelines, see the Cisco IOS XE object-group network command.

Device(config)# class-map type inspect xmatch-any myclass1
Device(config-cmap)# match group-object security source myobject1
Device(config-cmap)# end
object-group service
To define service object groups for use in object-group-based access control lists (ACLs), use the object-group service command in global configuration mode. To remove service object groups from the configuration, use the no form of this command.

Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco vManage CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
When you configure the object-group service command, configuration mode changes to service group configuration mode (config-service-group) allows you to populate or modify a service-object-group ACL. The following commands are available in service group configuration mode:
{tcp | udp | tcp-udp} [source {source-port-number | range minimum-port maximum-port}] [destination-port-number | range minimum-port maximum-port ] —Specifies a TCP or UDP protocol port number or a range of port numbers.
