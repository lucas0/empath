Introduction
This document describes the steps required to enable the license boot level for the Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge Software. When you boot a Catalyst 8000V Edge Software instance for the first time, the mode router boots in depends on the release version. You must install the software license or enable an evaluation license to obtain the supported throughput and features. Based on the release version you must enable the boot level or change the maximum throughput level and reboot the device.
Prerequisites
Pre-deployed Catalyst 8000V Edge Software, registered with the Smart Licensing Using Policy.
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:
Catalyst 8000V Edge Software basic configuration
Smart Licensing Using Policy configuration
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software versions:
 Catalyst 8000V Edge Software with Cisco IOS®-XE v17.4.1
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Background Information
In some Cat8000V Edge Software deployments that run Cisco IOS®-XE versions 17.4.x, the license boot level is not set. This causes problems with the license based features in the virtual router.

You have three options to setup the boot level in the virtual router, Network-Advantage, Network-Essentials and Network-Premiere.
Cat8000#configure termial

Cat8000(config)#license boot level ?
network-advantage License Level Network-Advantage
network-essentials License Level Network-Essentials
network-premier License Level Network-Premier
You have three options to configure the addon, based on the boot level that you choose, DNA-Advantage, DNA-Essentials and DNA-Premiere. 
Cat8000(config)#license boot level network-essentials addon ?

Cat8000(config)#license boot level network-premier addon ?
