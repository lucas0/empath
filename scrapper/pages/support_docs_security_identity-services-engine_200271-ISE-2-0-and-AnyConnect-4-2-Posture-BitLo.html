Introduction
This document describes how to encrypt endpoint's disk partition with the use of Microsoft BitLocker and how to configure Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) in order to provide full access to the network, only when the correct encryption is configured. Cisco ISE version 2.0 along with AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client 4.2 supports posture for disk encryption.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:
Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) CLI configuration and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) VPN configuration
Remote access VPN configuration on the ASA
ISE and posture services
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software versions:
Cisco ASA software versions 9.2.1 and later
Microsoft Windows Version 7 with Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Version 4.2 and later
Cisco ISE, Release 2.0 and later
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Configure
Network Diagram
The flow is as follows:
VPN session initiated by AnyConnect client is authenticated via ISE. Posture status of the endpoint is not known, rule ASA VPN unknown is hit and as a result the session is redirected to the ISE for provisioning
User opens web browser, HTTP traffic is redirected by ASA to ISE. ISE pushes the newest version of AnyConnect along with posture and compliance module to the endpoint
Once posture module is executed, it checks if partition E: is fully encrypted by BitLocker. If yes, the report is sent to ISE which triggers Radius Change of Authorization (CoA) without any ACL (full access)
VPN session on ASA is updated, redirect ACL is removed and the session has full access
VPN session is presented as an example. Posture functionality works fine too for other types of the access.
ASA
It is configured from remote SSL VPN access with the use of ISE as Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server. Radius CoA along with REDIRECT ACL needs to be configured:
aaa-server ISE20 protocol radius
 authorize-only
 interim-accounting-update periodic 1
 dynamic-authorization
aaa-server ISE20 (inside) host 10.48.17.235

For more details refer:
AnyConnect 4.0 Integration with ISE Version 1.3 Configuration Example
BitLocker on Windows 7
Navigate to Control Panel > System and Security > BitLocker Drive Encryption, enable E: partition encryption. Protect it by password (PIN) as shown in the image.
Once it is encrypted, mount it (with the provision of the password) and ensure that it is accessible as shown in the image.
For more details, follow Microsoft documentation:
Windows BitLocker Drive Encryption Step-by-Step Guide
ISE
Step 1. Network Device
Navigate to Administration > Network Resources > Network Devices, Add ASA with Device Type = ASA. This is used as a condition in the authorization rules but it is not mandatory (other types of conditions can be used).
If appropriate, Network Device Group does not exist. In order to create, navigate to Administration > Network Resources > Network Device Groups.
Step 2. Posture Condition and Policies
Ensure posture conditions are updated: Navigate to Administration > System > Settings > Posture > Updates > Update Now.
Navigate to Policy > Policy Elements > Conditions > Posture > Disk Encryption Condition, add a new condition as shown in the image.
This condition checks if BitLocker for Windows 7 is installed and if E: partition is fully encrypted.
Note: BitLocker is disk level encryption and it does not support Specific Location with path argument, only disk letter.
Navigate to Policy > Policy Elements > Results > Posture > Requirements in order to create a new requirement which uses the condition as shown in the image.
Navigate to Policy > Posture, add a condition for all Windows in order to use the requirement as shown in the image.
Step 3. Client Provisioning Resources and Policy
Navigate to Policy > Policy Elements > Client Provisioning > Resources, download Compliance Module from Cisco.com and manually upload AnyConnect 4.2 package as shown in the image.
Navigate to Add > NAC Agent or AnyConnect Posture Profile, create AnyConnect Posture profile (name: AnyConnectPosture) with default settings.
Navigate to Add > AnyConnect Configuration, add AnyConnect profile (name: AnyConnect Configuration) as shown in the image.
Navigate to Policy > Client Provisioning and modify default policy for Windows in order to use configured AnyConnect profile as shown in the image.
Step 4. Authorization Rules
Navigate to Policy > Policy Elements > Results > Authorization, add Authorization Profile (name: RedirectForPosture) which redirects to a default Client Provisioning Portal as shown in the image.
REDIRECT ACL is defined on ASA.
Navigate to Policy > Authorization, create 3 authorization rules as shown in the image.
If the endpoint is compliant, full access is provided. If status is unknown or non compliant, redirection for Client Provisioning is returned.
Verify
Use this section in order to confirm that your configuration works properly.
Step 1. VPN Session Establishment
Once the VPN session is established, ASA might want to perform an upgrade of AnyConnect modules as shown in the image.
On ISE the last rule is hit, as a result RedirectForPosture permissions are returned as shown in the image.
Once ASA finishes building the VPN session, it reports that redirection must occur:
ASAv# show vpn-sessiondb detail anyconnect

ISE Posture:
  Redirect URL : https://mgarcarz-ise20.example.com:8443/portal/gateway?sessionId=&portal=0d2ed780-6d90-11e5-978e-00505...
  Redirect ACL : REDIRECT
Step 2. Client Provisioning
At that stage, endpoint web browser traffic is redirected to ISE for client provisioning as shown in the image.
If needed, AnyConnect along with Posture and compliance module is updated as shown in the image.
Step 3. Posture Check and CoA
Posture module is executed, discover ISE (it might require to have DNS A record for enroll.cisco.com in order to succeed), download and check posture conditions as shown in the image.
Once it is confirmed that E: partition is fully encrypted by BitLocker, the correct report is sent to ISE as shown in the image.
This triggers CoA to reauthorize VPN session, as shown in the image.
ASA removes redirection ACL which provides full access. AnyConnect reports compliance as shown in the image.
Also, detailed reports on ISE can confirm that both conditions are satisfied (Posture Assesment by Condition is the new ISE 2.0 report that shows every condition). The first condition (hd_inst_BitLockerDriveEncryption_6_x) checks for the installation/process, the second one (hd_loc_bitlocker_specific_1) checks if specific location (E:) is fully encrypted as shown in the image.
ISE Posture Assesment by Endpoint report confirms that all the conditions are satisfied, as shown in the image.
The same can be confirmed from ise-psc.log debugs. Posture request received by ISE and the response:

Bugs
CSCux15941 - ISE 2.0 and AC4.2 posture bitlocker encryption with location failing (char \ / not supported)
Troubleshoot
This section provides information you can use in order to troubleshoot your configuration.
If the endpoint is non-compliant, it is reported by AnyConnect UI (also configured remediation is executed) as shown in the image.
ISE is able to provide the details on the failing conditions, as shown in the image.
The same can be checked from the CLI logs (examples of the logs in section Verify).
