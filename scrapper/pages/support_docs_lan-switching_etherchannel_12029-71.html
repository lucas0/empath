Introduction
This document discusses the setup of an EtherChannel between a Catalyst 5500/5000 switch running Catalyst OS (CatOS) and a Catalyst 6500/6000 or Catalyst 4500/4000 switch running Cisco IOSÂ® Software. An EtherChannel bundles individual links into a single logical link that provides higher bandwidth and redundancy between switches or other devices. You can refer to EtherChannel as either Fast EtherChannel (FEC) or Gigabit EtherChannel (GEC); it depends on the speed of the interfaces or ports that you use to form the EtherChannel. This configuration also applies to a Catalyst 4500/4000 or 6500/6000 series switch running CatOS that is connected to a Catalyst 4500/4000 or 6500/6000 series switch running Cisco IOS Software.
The configuration in this document bundles two Fast Ethernet (FE) ports from each of the switches into a FEC. This document uses the term "EtherChannel" to refer to GEC, FEC, port channel, channel, and port group.
This document only shows the configuration files from the switches and the output from the related sample show commands. For details on how to configure an EtherChannel, refer to these documents:

Sample Configuration: EtherChannel Between Catalyst Switches Running CatOS
Prerequisites
Requirements
Before you attempt this configuration, ensure that you have a basic understanding of:
EtherChannel configuration
Configuration of Catalyst 6500/6000 and Catalyst 5500/5000 series switches with the Command Line Interface (CLI)
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
Cisco Catalyst 5505 switch running CatOS 6.4(8) software
Cisco Catalyst 6509 switch running Cisco IOS Software Release 12.1(20)E
Note: For EtherChannel system requirements on Catalyst switches, refer to System Requirements to Implement EtherChannel on Catalyst Switches.
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Conventions
Refer to Cisco Technical Tips Conventions for more information on document conventions.
Background Theory
You can configure EtherChannel unconditionally (with channel mode on) or through autonegotiation. When you configure through autonegotiation, the switch negotiates the channel with the far end. To do this, it uses the Cisco proprietary Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) (with the channel mode desirable command) or the IEEE 802.3ad Link Aggregate Control Protocol (LACP) (with the channel mode active or channel mode passive commands). In this document, the EtherChannel configuration uses PAgP for autonegotiation.
All Catalyst switches running CatOS system software support PAgP. Catalyst 6500/6000 or 4500/4000 series switches running Cisco IOS System Software also support PAgP. The recommended mode to establish an EtherChannel between devices that support PAgP is desirable mode. PAgP protects against any improper configurations between the two devices. You can use channel mode on when the connecting device does not support PAgP and you need to set up the channel unconditionally. You can use the silent or non-silent keywords with auto and desirable channel modes. Catalyst 6500/6000 or 4500/4000 switches have the silent keyword enabled by default on all ports. The Catalyst 5500/5000 series switches have the silent keyword enabled by default on copper ports. For all fiber ports (FE and Gigabit Ethernet [GE]), the 5500/5000 switches have the non-silent keyword enabled by default. Use the default silent or non-silent keyword when you connect between Cisco switches.
Note: For additional information on PAgP channeling modes and silent/non-silent modes, refer to the Using PAgP to Configure EtherChannel (Recommended) section and the Silent/Non-Silent Mode section of the document Configuring EtherChannel Between Catalyst 4500/4000, 5500/5000, and 6500/6000 Switches That Run CatOS System Software.
Configure
This section presents the information to configure the features described in this document.
Network Diagram
This document uses this network setup:
Guidelines
When active links are aggregated into an EtherChannel, the ports momentarily leave the Spanning Tree and join back as a single, logical port. Until the Spanning Tree reconverges, the network traffic is disrupted.
If you do not use protocols such as PAgP or LACP for the configuration of EtherChannel because of other considerations, make sure that the required parameters are the same on both ends. If they are dissimilar, one end of the channel will go into err-disable mode. To recover the ports from err-disable mode, refer to these:
Errdisable Port State Recovery on the Cisco IOS Platforms
Recovering From errDisable Port State on the CatOS Platforms
Understanding EtherChannel Inconsistency Detection
Configurations
This document uses these configurations:
Catalyst 5500
Catalyst 6500
Note: To verify the capabilities for a module or switch port you configure, use the show port capabilities module command for switches running CatOS. For switches running Cisco IOS Software, use the show interfaces capabilities command.
Note: In the configurations, comments between the outputs appear in blue italics.
Catalyst 5500
cat5500 (enable) show config
This command shows non-default configurations only.
Use 'show config all' to show both default and non-default configurations.

For more information on the commands in the configuration, refer to Catalyst 5000 Family Command Reference (6.3 and 6.4).
Note: If you assign an interface to a VLAN that does not exist, the interface shuts down until you create the VLAN in the VLAN database. For more details, refer to the Creating or Modifying an Ethernet VLAN section of Configuring VLANs.

show port channel
show port module/port
show port channel info
To check the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) status in CatOS switches, issue these commands:
show spantree
show spantree vlan

Special Consideration with Use of Unconditional on Channel Mode
Cisco recommends the use of PAgP for port channel configuration, as this document describes. If you configure the EtherChannel unconditionally (with use of channel mode on) for any reason, you should create a port channel. This section provides the procedure. If you create a port channel, you avoid possible problems with STP during the configuration process. STP loop detection can disable the ports if you configure one side as a channel before the other side becomes a channel.
To set the ports for port channeling to disable mode on the CatOS switch, issue the set port disable module/port command.
Create the port channel (port group) on the Cisco IOS switch, and set the channel mode to on.
Create the port channel on the CatOS switch, and set the channel mode to on.
To reenable the ports that you disabled earlier on the first CatOS switch, issue the set port enable module/port command.
Troubleshoot
Performance Issues with EtherChannels
Performance issues with EtherChannels are caused by several conditions. Common causes include the incorrect load balancing algorithm and port specific physical layer issues.
To better understand and configure the load balancing algorithm, refer to these documents:
The Understanding How EtherChannel Frame Distribution Works section of Catalyst 6500 Series Software Configuration Guide, 8.6.
The Understanding Load Balancing section of Catalyst 6500 Series Cisco IOS Software Configuration Guide, 12.2SX.
For information on how to troubleshoot physical layer issues, refer to Troubleshooting Switch Port and Interface Problems.
