Each step in this high-level installation workflow links directly to the sections in the above-mentioned installation guide, making it easier for you to find information specific to Crosswork Network Controller.
This document is not intended to be a comprehensive installation guide.
Cisco Crosswork Network Controller
Cisco Crosswork Network Controller is a network automation solution for deploying and operating IP transport networks that delivers increased service agility, cost efficiency, and optimization for faster time-to-customer value and lower operating costs.
The solution combines intent-based network automation to deliver critical capabilities for service orchestration and fulfilment, network optimization, service path computation, device deployment and management, and anomaly detection and automatic remediation. Using telemetry gathering and automated responses, Cisco Crosswork Network Controller delivers network optimization capabilities that are nearly impossible to replicate even with a highly skilled and dedicated staff operating the network.
Its unified user interface allows real-time visualization of the network topology and services, monitoring of services and their health status, as well as service and transport provisioning, through a single pane of glass.
The fully integrated solution combines core capabilities from multiple innovative, industry-leading products including Cisco® Network Services Orchestrator (NSO), Cisco Segment Routing Path Computation Element (SR-PCE), and the Cisco Crosswork suite of applications.

3.0
Cisco Service Health (optional)
Reduces the time required to detect and troubleshoot service quality issues. It monitors the health status of provisioned L2/L3 VPN services and enables operators to pinpoint why and where a service is degraded. It can also provide service-specific monitoring, troubleshooting, assurance, and proactive causality through a heuristic model.
Note 
Cisco Service Health is available for pre-launch laboratory evaluation only. Engage your account team if you are interested in participating in the evaluation.
3.0
Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (Cisco NSO) (mandatory)
Crosswork Network Controller uses Cisco NSO for device management and service orchestration functionality. Cisco NSO is an orchestration platform that makes use of pluggable function packs to translate network-wide service intent into device-specific configuration. Cisco NSO provides flexible service orchestration and lifecycle management across physical and virtual network elements. For full Crosswork Network Controller functionality, Cisco NSO must be installed along with the Cisco NSO NEDs and function packs.

Cisco Network Element Drivers (NEDs) (mandatory)
Cisco NEDs comprise the network-facing part of Cisco NSO. They communicate over the native protocol supported by the device, such as Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF), Representational State Transfer (REST), Extensible Markup Language (XML), CLI, and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Cisco IOS XR:
CLI: 7.33.12
NETCONF: 6.6.3, 7.3, 7.315, and 7.4.1
Cisco IOS:

Cisco NSO Transport-SDN Function Pack (mandatory)
Consists of the following function packs:
SR-TE Core Function Pack (CFP) is a productized and supported implementation of SR-TE automation.
Cisco NSO Example Function Packs provide example implementations as a starting point for Layer 2 and Layer 3 VPN service provisioning functionality in Crosswork Network Controller. The intention is for customers to work with a Cisco Customer Experience representative to adapt these sample function packs to their specific networks and requirements.
3.0.0
Cisco NSO T-SDN Function Pack Installation Guide Version 3.0.0
Cisco NSO Device Lifecycle Management (DLM) Service Pack (mandatory)
Installed on a Cisco NSO instance in order to synchronize device configurations in Cisco Crosswork with those in Cisco NSO. It effectively channels communication between the Crosswork DLM and Cisco NSO.
4.1.0
Cisco NSO DLM Service Pack Installation Guide Version 4.1.0
Cisco Crosswork NSO Telemetry Traffic Collector Function Pack (mandatory)
Cisco Crosswork Telemetry Traffic Collector Function Pack is installed on the Cisco NSO platform and is used to push services and network configurations to the devices. It utilizes Cisco NSO Reactive FastMap (RFM) nano services to manage the telemetry configuration on devices. This is primarily used for dial-out MDT collection.
