CRU information and replacement instructions are shipped with the replacement unit and are available from Cisco at any time upon request. Cisco specifies the material shipped with the replacement unit whether the defective unit must be returned to Cisco. If a return of the defective is required 1) the Customer instructions and a container are shipped with the replacement unit and 2) Customers may be charged for the replacement unit if Cisco does not receive the defective unit within the period specified in the return instructions.
Advanced Replacement Warranty Service: Under the terms of the advanced replacement warranty service, Cisco will ship a replacement unit directly to the Customer if the Cisco hardware product purchased is diagnosed as defective. Cisco or its service center will use commercially reasonable efforts to ship a replacement part within the Next Cisco Business Day (“NBD”) after receipt of the Return Materials Authorization (“RMA”) request. Actual delivery times may vary depending on Customer location.
Onsite Support: Onsite support may be utilized to address the defective unit. Cisco may, at its sole discretion, determine if a defect can be repaired through any of the following means:

●   By the use of a CRU part
●   By a service call at the location of the defective unit
Cisco reserves the right to refund the purchase price as its exclusive warranty remedy.
