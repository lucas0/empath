The Cisco Webex® Room Phone is a conference phone designed for collaborative meetings.

The Room Phone has a brilliant 6-inch full-HD touchscreen with instant access to meetings, calling, directories, and content sharing.
The power of Webex in a conference phone
Finally, you can enjoy a meeting solution that’s simple and easy to use. Never enter a phone number or meeting code ever again. Now it’s as simple as pushing one button to join through the touchscreen or Webex apps when proximity paired. You and you guest can also share content locally or in-meeting using wireless and wired options.
The room-filling HD audio, 360-degree coverage, acoustic echo cancellation, and noise reduction allow remote meeting attendees to hear the voices of conference room attendees clearly.
Plus, with devices analytics and insights via Webex Control Hub, you can track and monitor device utilization, identify popular meeting rooms, and plan device deployment.
Flexible deployment with options to combine cloud and on-premises features
Enjoy ultimate flexibility in deployment and protect your on-premises investments with options to combine cloud and on-premises features.
Get the best of both worlds by intelligently routing meetings to the cloud and calls through on-premises call control, or keep all calls and media on premises and consume cloud features.
How the Webex Room Phone differs from other conference phones in the market
Our first distinction is the 6-inch full-HD touchscreen, which provides the same user interface as the rest of the Webex device portfolio.
We also provide an additional port, a HDMI-out to any HD display that is used to show meeting information, sharing, and digital signage. These features are usually seen with higher priced video solutions.
As opposed to other conference phones in the market, Room Phone is a single device solution that can allow multiple people in small- and medium-size conference rooms to collaborate effectively in meetings.
Finally, we support device management and usage analytics through Webex Control Hub, which makes deploying, configuring, and supporting Room Phone simple.
