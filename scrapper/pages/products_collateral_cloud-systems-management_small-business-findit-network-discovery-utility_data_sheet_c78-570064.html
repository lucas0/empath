Product Overview
Finding even basic information about the devices in your small business network can be difficult. Determining the IP address assigned to a particular piece of equipment can mean a search through notebooks or a nonintuitive device manager. Even finding a serial number, often needed when making a support call, can mean a trip to the equipment closet to look at the device itself.
The Cisco® Small Business FindIT Network Discovery Utility simplifies your search for this basic information by adding an intuitive sidebar to your web browser. FindIT automatically discovers Cisco Small Business products in your network and displays the information you need to manage, troubleshoot, or add a new component to your network. For instance, the utility displays the device support status, serial number, hardware or software version, and IP address. The latest firmware for the devices is automatically identified, and you can download it with a single click.

●   Support for Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and Mozilla Firefox browsers running on Microsoft Windows and Apple OS X
