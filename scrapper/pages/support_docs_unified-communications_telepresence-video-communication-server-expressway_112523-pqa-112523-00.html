Q. The Presence status of my endpoints sometimes seems to take a while to update in VCS. How can I fix this?
A. When the VCS is sent a registration, de-registration, in-call or call-ended message by the endpoint, the VCS's Presence User Agent (PUA) will update the endpoint's presence status immediately.
However, there are two situations when changes will not be updated immediately:
If the endpoint goes offline without first reporting a status change to the VCS (e.g. if it is powered down or unplugged), the PUA will only change the endpoint's status to off-line when it fails to receive the next registration refresh from the endpoint.
If the PUA is enabled after the endpoint has already registered, it will only report the endpoint as on-line when it receives the next registration refresh from the endpoint.
The frequency of registration refreshes is configured by the VCS as follows:
For SIP endpoints, by the Registration expire delta setting (VCS configuration > Protocols > SIP > Configuration). The default is 60 seconds.
For H.323 endpoints, by the Time to live setting (VCS configuration > Protocols > H.323). The default is 30 minutes.
You can change either or both of these settings to reduce the time taken for the PUA to update the endpoint's status.
