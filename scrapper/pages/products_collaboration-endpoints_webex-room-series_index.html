Cisco Webex - A one and done solution for us.
We have used Cisco Webex for more than a few discussions and product presentations with our customers. We have found it to be easy to use and intuitive from the user interface alone. From there, the audio and video quality was appreciated by our customers in those presentations which made what we were trying to convey move a lot easier.
