Service Provisioning
Crosswork Hierarchical Controller supports the creation of new transport client services and photonic services.
Crosswork Hierarchical Controller abstracts the service model and provides users with a simple and intuitive user interface to provision new services.
It is assumed that domain controller implicitly handles the creation/use of the underlay path (OTSiMC, OTN, MPLS-TP) as required to fulfil the service request.
The table below defines the required parameters per service type.
Crosswork Hierarchical Controller requires the optical controller to support the connectivity-service API by TAPI. A proper use of the layers is needed per the service type.

Crosswork Hierarchical Controller in Brief
The Crosswork Hierarchical Controller product family is a set of software applications built on a common Crosswork Hierarchical Controller platform, designed to accelerate automation and to increase efficiency and reliability of service providers networks. Crosswork Hierarchical Controller addresses the role of the multi-domain, multi-layer, and multi-vendor network controller.
Sedona’s innovative capability to learn the mapping between IP/MPLS and optical layer ports (cross-layer mapping) is key to providing a comprehensive view of the network. This has historically been a very difficult problem to solve since there are no standards to automatically provide discovery of such links. This process applies to IP/MPLS-optical links, as well as to cross-domain optical links.
Achieving automation of the complete process, without compromising on resiliency must involve fibers discovery and GIS information. Both enable the understanding of risks in planning phases and crucial information to assess failure impact on services in operations.
Crosswork Hierarchical Controller is the sole product of its type, in today’s market, that is fully multi-layer and multi-vendor. It is also the only product of this type to be deployed in production by Tier 1 service providers. The system interfaces with SDN Domain Controllers for the packet layers (IP, MPLS) and transport layers (WDM, OTN, Packet-Optical, Microwave) to create a coherent view of the entire transport network, as shown in Figure 1 below, and enables automation of its functions and simplified abstracted interaction with Service Orchestrators and OSS tools.

Transport SDN Architecture
Services Management – The Need
Services Manager is a key Cisco Crosswork Hierarchical Controller application that allows for the creation of L1-L3 services and L1-L3 underlay tunnels and links across the entire SP network.
Crosswork Hierarchical Controller can discover L1-L3 services from area/domain controllers. It can discover intra-domain and inter-domain E-Line and L3-VPN services while completing the information on all LSPs along the path, VRFs, and all inter-AS options. This allows Crosswork Hierarchical Controller to discover existing services, as well as new services it has provisioned.
Crosswork Hierarchical Controller supports service lifecycle state (provisioned, pending, planned), operational state and admin state.
Basic service instantiation is supported by the Domain Controller for each domain. However, none of the Domain Controllers understand how to achieve a globally optimal path for an end-to-end service.
Using its own global Path Computation Element (PCE), Crosswork Hierarchical Controller can calculate the optimal end-to-end multidomain path for the service, set it up in each Domain Controller and make sure the service parts are stitched together across domain boundaries.
In fact, a service can span different layers for its delivery. For example, an E-Line service can start on an OTN metro network, then be handed off to the MPLS core network, where it is carried over a pseudowire (PW) in an MPLS tunnel, and then over a packet-optical access network to its final destination. Crosswork Hierarchical Controller figures out which layers should be used to set up the service, based on user-defined policies.
Crosswork Hierarchical Controller supports IP services as defined by IETF in L2NM, L3NM and optical services as defined by ONF TAPI interface.
Crosswork Hierarchical Controller abstracts the service configuration and provides simple, intent-based API and UI to create new services with endpoint details, SLA, and associations to a predefined template that can be overridden for better adjustment.
Services and tunnels currently supported for provisioning and modification by the Services Manager:
●       Tunnels:
◦       RSVP-TE tunnel over single domain
◦       SR policy over single domain
●       Point-to-Point:
◦       IP links between two routers over ZR/+ and over alien lambda (as multi-vendor optical network)
◦       OCH Link
◦       OCH-NC Link
◦       OTN Line
◦       Circuit E-Line
◦       Packet E-Line over packet-optical network
●       Multi-Point:
◦       L3 VPN over multi domain and multi-vendor IP-MPLS (currently in demo mode only)
Service configuration is based on the use of templates (these will be available in a future version). This helps to abstract service provisioning requests, using templates as a reference, and loading service configuration as a basic default that can be overridden per specific request. The configuration will still be able to be overridden for a specific service provisioning request.
Endpoints can be added to the UI wizard by selecting them from the inventory. Ports enabled for selection are those applicable for the service type. Per endpoint, the bandwidth can be defined (as CIR, EIR, CBS, PBS) and VLAN and COS classification can be added.
Crosswork Hierarchical Controller has a sophisticated global multilayer PCE to calculate services and underlay paths. The calculation is based on the selected criteria: number of hops, latency, or admin cost. It also considers the preferences for protection, diversity, SRLG, specific links, devices, or service paths to include or exclude, and resources available per the requested bandwidth.
PCE works over multiple domains, where it can calculate paths’ diversity between domains as a full path of end-to-end service.
Depending on the implementation, PCE knows how to work with vendor-specific capabilities and constraints and how to verify the feasibility of a path before putting it in action.
Creation of a service is managed as a network transaction. Commands are sent to all participating Domain Controllers. Upon completion, the configuration undergoes validation in all domains before notifying the user of configuration success. In the event of failure, PCE knows to roll back and leave no broken configuration in any Domain Controller.
This transaction mechanism knows how to overcome a failure in Crosswork Hierarchical Controller because the backup system can continue tracking the transaction and act according to the response from the Domain Controllers.
Each action on a service or tunnel (creation, modification, deletion) done via the UI or via APIs is recorded as an operation. An operation contains the full details of the action and its results, log of the service scheme sent to the controllers, the returned results, error messages from domain controllers, and the operation status.
Operations can be viewed per selected service or tunnel and as a list of all operations.

For services that were created by using the MCP controller and not the Services Management application, the service appears as Is Brownfield: True. The Crosswork Hierarchical Controller MCP adapter discovers these services and creates service intent for each of them. The following delegated service types are supported: Packet E-Line, Circuit E-Line, OTN‑Line, and OCH (Wavelength) services.
Create IP Link
You can create an IP Link between two ZR pluggable components in routers (creating a new link or adding it to a LAG). Various advanced settings and limitations (such as node or link to be included in the path or excluded from the path of the OCH Link) can be added. The end-to-end service between ZR/+ ports may optionally traverse through OLSs (or ONEs, Optical Network Elements, Cisco, or 3rd party). Crosswork Hierarchical Controller decomposes the service into domains and provisions the optical line between ROADMs on the optical domain controller. The activation mode works directly from Crosswork Hierarchical Controller to IP and optical domain controllers (CNC, ONC).
ZR and ZR+ pluggables manufactured by Cisco output a maximum of -10dBm. There are ROADM setups that can benefit from or require a stronger signal. The new ZR bright pluggable outputs 0dBm and is supported for IP provisioning. BRT appears in the device description, for example, Cisco QDD 400G BRT ZRP Pluggable Optics Module.
You can create L Band and C Band links. L-Band introduces a second OMS over the line-side OTS.
For example, Fiber-1 (OTS link is used) by two OMS-1 and OMS-2 (OMS links).
  With both L Band and C Band, for a single OTS there are 2 (or more) OMS links.
For example:
Port[.type = "OMS" and .provider = "onc-titan"] | link [.layer = "OMS”] 
For a single OTS link, there are 2 OTS ports and 4 (or more) OMS ports where the UpperPorts field holds the “upper” OMS ports for each OTS port.
For example:
port[.type = "OMS""] | link | port | downward ("OTS”)
For more info on how to view links and ports in SHQL, see the Cisco Crosswork Hierarchical Controller NBI and SHQL Reference Guide.
