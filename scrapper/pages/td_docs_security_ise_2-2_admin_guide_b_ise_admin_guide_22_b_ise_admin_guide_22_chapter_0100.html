Cisco ISE Administrators
Administrators can use the admin portal to:
Manage deployments, help desk operations, network devices, and node monitoring and troubleshooting.
Manage Cisco ISE services, policies, administrator accounts, and system configuration and operations.
Change administrator and user passwords.
A CLI administrator can start and stop the Cisco ISE application, apply software patches and upgrades, reload or shut down the Cisco ISE appliance, and view all the system and application logs. Because of the special privileges that are granted to a CLI administrator, we recommend that you protect the CLI administrator credentials and create web-based administrators for configuring and managing Cisco ISE deployments.
The username and password that you configure during setup is intended only for administrative access to the CLI. This role is considered to be the CLI admin user, also known as CLI administrator. By default, the username for a CLI admin user is admin, and the password is defined during setup. There is no default password. This CLI admin user is the default admin user, and this user account cannot be deleted. However, other administrators can edit it, including options to enable, disable, or change password for the corresponding account.
You can either create an administrator, or you can promote an existing user to an administrator role. Administrators can also be demoted to simple network user status by disabling the corresponding administrative privileges.
Administrators are users who have local privileges to configure and operate the Cisco ISE system.
Administrators are assigned to one or more admin groups.

Note
Starting with Cisco ISE Release 2.7, use alphanumeric values while creating user accounts in Cisco ISE.

Privileges of a CLI Administrator Versus a Web-Based Administrator
A CLI administrator can start and stop the Cisco ISE application, apply software patches and upgrades, reload or shut down the Cisco ISE appliance, and view all the system and application logs. Because of the special privileges granted to a CLI administrator, we recommend that you protect the CLI administrator credentials and create web-based administrators for configuring and managing Cisco ISE deployments.
Create a New Administrator
Cisco ISE administrators need accounts with specific roles assigned to them in order to perform specific administrative tasks. You can create multiple administrator accounts and assign one or more roles to these admins based on the administrative tasks that these admins have to perform.
Use the Admin Users window to view, create, modify, delete, change the status, duplicate, or search for attributes of Cisco ISE administrators.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Administration > System > Admin Access > Administrators > Admin Users > Add.
Step 2
From the Add drop-down, choose one of the following options:
Create an Admin User
If you choose Create an Admin User, a New Administrator window appears, from where you can configure account information for the new admin user.
Select from Network Access Users
If you choose Select from Network Access Users, a list of current users appears, from which you can choose a user. Subsequently, the Admin User window corresponding to this user appears.
Step 3
Enter values in the fields. The characters supported for the Name field are # $ ’ ( ) * + - . / @ _.
The admin user name must be unique. If you have entered an existing user name, an error pop-up window displays the following message:
User can't be created. A User with that name already exists.
Step 4
Click Submit to create a new administrator in the Cisco ISE internal database.

Cisco ISE Administrator Groups
Administrator groups are role-based access control (RBAC) groups in Cisco ISE. All the administrators who belong to the same group share a common identity and have the same privileges. An administrator’s identity as a member of a specific administrative group can be used as a condition in authorization policies. An administrator can belong to more than one administrator group.
An administrator account with any level of access can be used to modify or delete objects for which it has permission, on any window it has access to.
The Cisco ISE security model limits administrators to creating administrative groups that contain the same set of privileges that the administrator has. The privileges given are based on the administrative role of the user, as defined in the Cisco ISE database. Thus, administrative groups form the basis for defining privileges to access the Cisco ISE systems.
The following table lists the admin groups that are predefined in Cisco ISE, and the tasks that members from these groups can perform.

Cisco ISE Administrators
Create an Admin Group
The Admin Groups window allows you to view, create, modify, delete, duplicate, or filter Cisco ISE network admin groups.
Before you begin
To configure an external administrator group type, you must have already specified one or more external identity stores.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Administration > System > Admin Access > Administrators > Admin Groups.
Step 2
Click Add, and enter a name and description.
The supported special characters for the Name field are: space, # $ & ‘ ( ) * + - . / @ _ .
Step 3
Check the corresponding check box to specify the Type of administrator group you are configuring:
Internal: Administrators assigned to this group type authenticate against the credentials that are stored in the Cisco ISE internal database.
External: Administrators assigned to this group authenticate against the credentials stored in the external identity store that you select in the Administration > System > Admin Access > Authentication > Authentication Method window. You can specify the external groups, if required.
Note 
If an internal user is configured with an external identity store for authentication, while logging in to the ISE Admin portal, the internal user must select the external identity store as the Identity Source. Authentication will fail if Internal Identity Source is selected.
Step 4
Click Add in the Member Users area to add users to this admin group. To delete users from the admin group, check the check box corresponding to the user that you want to delete, and click Remove.
Step 5
Click Submit.
Administrative Access to Cisco ISE
Cisco ISE administrators can perform various administrative tasks based on the administrative group to which they belong. These administrative tasks are critical. Grant administrative access only to users who are authorized to administer Cisco ISE in your network.
Cisco ISE allows you to control administrative access to its web interface through the options described here. .
Administrative Access Methods
You can connect to the Cisco ISE servers in several ways. The Policy Administration node (PAN) runs the Administrators portal. An admin password is required to log in. Other ISE persona servers are accessible through SSH or the console, where you run the CLI. This section describes the process and password options available for each connection type.
Admin password: The Cisco ISE Admin user that you created during installation times out in 45 days by default. You can prevent that by turning off the password lifetime from Administration > System > Admin Settings. Click the Password Policy tab, and uncheck theAdministrative passwords expire check box under Password Lifetime.
If you do not do this, and the password expires, you can reset the admin password in the CLI by running the application reset-passwd command. You can reset the Admin password by connecting to the console to access the CLI, or by rebooting the ISE image file to access the boot options menu.
CLI password: You must enter a CLI password during installation. If you have a problem logging in to the CLI because of an invalid password, you can reset the CLI password. Connect to the console and run the password CLI command to rest the password. See the Cisco Identity Services Engine CLI Reference Guide for more information.
SSH access to the CLI: You can enable SSH access either during installation or after, using the service sshd command. You can also force SSH connections to use a key. Note that when you do this, SSH connections to all the network devices also use that key. For more information, see SSH Key Validation. You can force the SSH key to use the Diffie-Hellman algorithm. Note that ECDSA keys are not supported for SSH keys.

Role-Based Admin Access Control in Cisco ISE
Cisco ISE provides role-based access control (RBAC) policies that ensure security by restricting administrative privileges. RBAC policies are associated with default admin groups to define roles and permissions. A standard set of permissions (for menu as well as data access) is paired with each of the predefined admin groups, and is thereby aligned with the associated role and job function.
Some features in the user interface require certain permissions for their use. If a feature is unavailable, or you are not allowed to perform a specific task, your admin group may not have the necessary permissions to perform the task that utilizes the feature.
Regardless of the level of access, any administrator account can modify or delete objects for which it has permission, on any window that it can access. Read-only functionality is unavailable for any administrative access.

Note
Only system-defined admin users with Super Admin or Read Only Admin permissions can see the identity-based users who are not a part of a user group. Admins you create without these permissions cannot see these users.

Role-Based Permissions
Cisco ISE allows you to configure permissions at the menu and data levels. These are called menu access and data access permissions.
The menu access permissions allow you to show or hide the menu and submenu items of the Cisco ISE administrative interface. This feature lets you create permissions so that you can restrict or enable access at the menu level.
The data access permissions allow you to grant read and write, read only, or no access to the Admin Groups, User Identity Groups, Endpoint Identity Groups, Locations, and Device Types data in the Cisco ISE interface.
RBAC Policies
RBAC policies determine if an administrator can be granted a specific type of access to a menu item or other identity group data elements. You can grant or deny access to a menu item or identity group data element to an administrator based on the admin group, by using RBAC policies. When administrators log in to the Admin portal, they can access menus and data that are based on the policies and permissions defined for the admin groups with which they are associated.
RBAC policies map admin groups to menu access and data access permissions. For example, you can prevent a network administrator from viewing the Admin Access operations menu and the policy data elements. This can be achieved by creating a custom RBAC policy for the admin group with which that network administrator is associated.

Note
If you are using customized RBAC policies for admin access, ensure that you provide all the relevant menu access for a given data access. For example, to add or delete endpoints with data access of Identity or Policy Admin, you must provide menu access to Work Center > Network Access and Administration > Identity Management.
Default Menu Access Permissions
Cisco ISE provides an out-of-the-box set of permissions that are associated with a set of predefined admin groups. Having predefined admin group permissions allow you to set permissions so that a member of any admin group can have full or limited access to the menu items within the administrative interface (known as menu access) and to delegate an admin group to use the data access elements of other admin groups (known as data access). These permissions are reusable entities that can be further used to formulate RBAC policies for various admin groups. Cisco ISE provides a set of system-defined menu access permissions that are already used in the default RBAC policies. Apart from the predefined menu access permissions, Cisco ISE also allows you to create custom menu access permissions that you can use in RBAC policies. The key icon represents menu access privileges for the menus and submenus, and the key with a close icon represents no access for different RBAC groups.

Note
For a Super Admin user, all the menu items are available. For other admin users, all the menu items in the Menu Access Privileges column are available for standalone deployment and primary node in a distributed deployment. For secondary nodes in a distributed deployment, the menu items under the Administration tab are not available.
Configure Menu Access Permissions
Cisco ISE allows you to create custom menu access permissions that you can map to an RBAC policy. Depending on the role of the administrators, you can allow them to access only specific menu options.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Administration > System > Admin Access > Authorization > Permissions > Menu Access.
Step 2
Click Add, and enter values for the Name and Description fields.
Expand the ISE Navigation Structure menu to the desired level, and click the options for which you want to create permissions.
In the Permissions for Menu Access pane, click Show.
Step 3
Click Submit.
Prerequisites for Granting Data Access Permissions
When an RBAC admin has Full Access permission to an object (for example, Employee in the User Identity Groups data type), the admin can view, add, update, and delete users who belong to that group. Ensure that the admin has menu access permission granted for the Users window (Administration > Identity Management > Identities > Users). This is applicable for network devices and endpoints objects (based on the permissions granted to the Network Device Groups and Endpoint Identity Groups data types).
You cannot enable or restrict data access for network devices that belong to the default network device group objects—All Device Types and All Locations. All the network devices are displayed if Full Access data permission is granted to an object created under these default network device group objects. Therefore,we recommend that you create a separate hierarchy for the Network Device Groups data type, which is independent of the default network device group objects. You should assign the network device objects to the newly created Network Devices Groups to create restricted access.

Note
You can enable or restrict data access permissions only for the User Identity Groups, Network Device Groups, and Endpoint Identity Groups, not to Admin Groups.
Default Data Access Permissions
Cisco ISE comes with a set of predefined data access permissions. These permissions enable multiple administrators to have the data access permissions within the same user population. You can enable or restrict the use of data access permissions to one or more admin groups. This process allows autonomous delegated control to administrators of one admin group to reuse data access permissions of the chosen admin groups through selective association. Data access permissions range from full access to no access for viewing selected admin groups or network device groups. RBAC policies are defined based on the administrator (RBAC) group, menu access, and data access permissions. You should first create menu access and data access permissions and then create an RBAC policy that associates an admin group with the corresponding menu access and data access permissions. The RBAC policy takes the form: If admin_group=Super Admin then assign SuperAdmin Menu Access permission + SuperAdmin Data Access permission. Apart from the predefined data access permissions, Cisco ISE also allows you to create custom data access permissions that you can associate with an RBAC policy.
There are three data access permissions, namely, Full Access, No Access, and Read Only access that can be granted to admin groups.
The Read Only permission can be granted to the following admin groups:
Administration > Admin Access > Administrators > Admin Groups
Administration > Groups > User Identity Group
Administration > Groups > Endpoint Identity Groups
Network Visibility > Endpoints
Administration > Network Resources > Network Device Groups
Administration > Network Resources > Network Devices
Administration > Identity Management > Identities
Administration > Identity Management > Groups > User Identity Groups
Administration > Identity Management > Groups > Endpoint Identity Groups
If you have read-Only permission for a data type (for example, Endpoint Identity Groups), you will not be able to perform CRUD operations on that data type. If you have read-only permission for an object (for example, GuestEndpoints), you cannot perform edit or delete operations on that object.
The following image describes how Data Access Privileges apply at the second-level or third-level menu that contains additional submenus or options for different RBAC groups.

Configure Data Access Permissions
Cisco ISE allows you to create custom data access permissions that you can map to an RBAC policy. Based on the role of the administrator, you can choose to provide them access only to select data.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Administration > System > Admin Access > Authorization > Permissions.
Step 2
Choose Permissions > Data Access.
Step 3
Click Add, and enter values for the Name and Description fields.
Click to expand the admin group and select the corresponding admin group.
Click Full Access, Read Only Access, or No Access.
Step 4
Click Save.
Configure Admin Access Policies
An RBAC policy is represented in an if-then format, where "if" is the RBAC Admin Group value and "then" is the RBAC Permissions value.
The RBAC policies window ( Administration > System > Admin Access > Authorization) contains a list of default policies. You cannot edit or delete these default policies. The RBAC policies page also allows you to create custom RBAC policies for an admin group specifically for your work place, and apply to personalized admin groups.
When you assign limited menu access, make sure that the data access permissions allow the administrator to access the data that is required to use the specified menus. For example, if you give menu access to the MyDevices portal, but don't allow data access to Endpoint Identity Groups, then that administrator cannot modify the portal.

Note
Admin users can move endpoint MAC addresses from the Endpoint Identity Groups they have read-only access to, to the Endpoint Identity Groups they have full access to. The other way around is not possible.
Before you begin
Create all the admin groups for which you want to define the role-based access control (RBAC) policies.
Ensure that these admin groups are mapped to individual admin users.
Ensure that you have configured the RBAC permissions such as menu access and data access permissions.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Administration > System > Admin Access > Authorization > Policy.
The RBAC Policies page contains a set of ready-to-use predefined policies for default admin groups. You cannot edit or delete these default policies.
Step 2
Click Actions next to any of the default RBAC policy rule.
Here, you can insert new RBAC policies, duplicate an existing RBAC policy, and delete an existing RBAC policy.
Step 3
Click Insert new policy.
Step 4

Administrative Access to Cisco ISE Using an External Identity Store
In Cisco ISE, you can authenticate administrators via an external identity store such as Active Directory, LDAP, or RSA SecureID. There are two models you can use to provide authentication via an external identity store:
External Authentication and Authorization: There are no credentials that are specified in the local Cisco ISE database for the administrator, and authorization is based on external identity store group membership only. This model is used for Active Directory and LDAP authentication.
External Authentication and Internal Authorization: The administrator’s authentication credentials come from the external identity source, and authorization and administrator role assignment take place using the local Cisco ISE database. This model is used for RSA SecurID authentication. This method requires you to configure the same username in both the external identity store and the local Cisco ISE database.
During the authentication process, Cisco ISE is designed to “fall back” and attempt to perform authentication from the internal identity database, if communication with the external identity store has not been established or if it fails. In addition, whenever an administrator for whom you have set up external authentication launches a browser and initiates a login session, the administrator still has the option to request authentication via the Cisco ISE local database by choosing Internal from the Identity Store drop-down list in the login dialog box.
Administrators who belong to a Super Admin group, and are configured to authenticate and authorize using an external identity store, can also authenticate with the external identity store for Command Line Interface (CLI) access.

Note
You can configure this method of providing external administrator authentication only via the Admin portal. Cisco ISE CLI does not feature these functions.
If your network does not already have one or more existing external identity stores, ensure that you have installed the necessary external identity stores and configured Cisco ISE to access those identity stores.

External Authentication and Authorization
By default, Cisco ISE provides internal administrator authentication. To set up external authentication, you must create a password policy for the external administrator accounts that you define in the external identity stores. You can then apply this policy to the external administrator groups that eventually become a part of the external administrator RBAC policy.
To configure external authentication, you must:
Configure password-based authentication using an external identity store.
Create an external administrator group.
Configure menu access and data access permissions for the external administrator group.
Create an RBAC policy for external administrator authentication.
In addition to providing authentication via an external identity store, your network may also require you to use a Common Access Card (CAC) authentication device.
Configure a Password-Based Authentication Using an External Identity Store
Create an External Administrator Group
Configure Menu Access and Data Access Permissions for External Administrator Group
Create an RBAC Policy for External Administrator Authentication
Configure a Password-Based Authentication Using an External Identity Store
You must first configure password-based authentication for administrators who authenticate using an external identity store such as Active Directory or LDAP.
Procedure
Step 1
Step 2
On the Authentication Method tab, click Password Based and choose one of the external identity sources you have already configured. For example, the Active Directory instance that you have created.
Step 3
Configure any other specific password policy settings that you want for administrators who authenticate using an external identity store.
Step 4
Click Save.
Create an External Administrator Group
You will need to create an external Active Directory or LDAP administrator group. This ensures that Cisco ISE uses the username that is defined in the external Active Directory or LDAP identity store to validate the administrator username and password that you entered upon login.
Cisco ISE imports the Active Directory or LDAP group information from the external resource and stores it as a dictionary attribute. You can then specify that attribute as one of the policy elements while configuring the RBAC policy for this external administrator authentication method.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Administration > System > Admin Access > Administrators > Admin Groups.
Step 2
Click Add.
Step 3
Enter a name and optional description.
Step 4
Click External.
If you have connected and joined to an Active Directory domain, your Active Directory instance name appears in the Name field.
Step 5
From the External Groups drop-down list box, choose the Active Directory group that you want to map for this external administrator group.
Click the “+” sign to map additional Active Directory groups to this external administrator group.
Step 6
Click Save.
Configure Menu Access and Data Access Permissions for External Administrator Group
You must configure menu access and data access permissions that can be assigned to the external administrator group.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Administration > System > Admin Access > Permissions.
Step 2
Click one of the following:
Menu Access: All administrators who belong to the external administrator group can be granted permission at the menu or submenu level. The menu access permission determines the menus or submenus that they can access.
Data Access: All administrators who belong to the external administrator group can be granted permission at the data level. The data access permission determines the data that they can access.
Step 3
Specify menu access or data access permissions for the external administrator group.
Step 4
Click Save.
Create an RBAC Policy for External Administrator Authentication
You must configure a new RBAC policy to authenticate an administrator using an external identity store and to specify custom menu and data access permissions. This policy must have the external administrator group for authentication and the Cisco ISE menu and data access permissions to manage the external authentication and authorization.

Note
You cannot modify an existing (system-preset) RBAC policy to specify these new external attributes. If you have an existing policy that you would like to use as a template, you must duplicate that policy, rename it, and then assign the new attributes.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Administration > System > Admin Access > Authorization > Policy.
Step 2
Specify the rule name, external administrator group, and permissions.
Remember that the appropriate external administrator group must be assigned to the correct administrator user IDs. Ensure that the administrator is associated with the correct external administrator group.
Step 3
Click Save.
If you log in as an administrator, and the Cisco ISE RBAC policy is not able to authenticate your administrator identity, Cisco ISE displays an “unauthenticated” message, and you cannot access the Admin portal.
Configure Admin Access Using an External Identity Store for Authentication with Internal Authorization
This method requires you to configure the same username in both the external identity store and the local Cisco ISE database. When you configure Cisco ISE to provide administrator authentication using an external RSA SecurID identity store, administrator credential authentication is performed by the RSA identity store. However, authorization (policy application) is still done according to the Cisco ISE internal database. In addition, there are two important factors to remember that are different from external authentication and authorization:
You do not need to specify any particular external administrator groups for the administrator.
You must configure the same username in both the external identity store and the local Cisco ISE database.
Procedure
Step 1
Step 2
Ensure that the administrator username in the external RSA identity store is also present in Cisco ISE. Ensure that you click the External option under Password.
Note 
You do not need to specify a password for this external administrator user ID, nor are you required to apply any specially configured external administrator group to the associated RBAC policy.
Step 3
Click Save.
External Authentication Process Flow
External Authentication Process Flow
When the administrator logs in, the login session passes through the following steps in the process:
The administrator sends an RSA SecurID challenge.
RSA SecurID returns a challenge response.
The administrator enters a user name and the RSA SecurID challenge response in the Cisco ISE login dialog, as if entering the user ID and password.
The administrator ensures that the specified Identity Store is the external RSA SecurID resource.
The administrator clicks Login.
Upon logging in, the administrator sees only the menu and data access items that are specified in the RBAC policy.
