Introduction
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway is a model-driven scalable data collection platform that enables real-time data collection from multi-protocol capable devices, thereby reducing the need for multiple collection points for multiple applications requiring data from the network.
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway is not a standalone product and needs to be deployed with one of the following Crosswork options:
Crosswork Cloud (Crosswork Trust Insights and Crosswork Network Insights)
Crosswork On Premise Applications (Crosswork Change Automation and Health Insights and Crosswork Optimization Engine)
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway offers central visibility into services collecting data and type of data being collected. It can also be used to feed external data destinations (such as, an external Kafka or gRPC server) apart from Crosswork applications.
New Features, Enhancements, and Requirements
New features and enhancements provided in the Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway 1.1.3 release include:
Option to deploy Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway with either 1, 2, or 3 NICs configurations
Option to change the MTU of vNIC1 when deployed with 3 vNICs
Option to test SSH connection (Cloud only)
Release Dates
Cisco releases updated builds on the Cisco Support & Download site when needed.

Compatibility Information
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway 1.1.3 supports both Crosswork On Premise and Crosswork Cloud applications.
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway 1.1.3 can currently be used with a single Crosswork application. Customers wishing to use a combination of applications (Cisco Crosswork Change Automation and Health Insights and Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine) would need to deploy duplicate instances of Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway.
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway release 1.1.3 has been validated in conjunction with the following Crosswork applications:
Cisco Crosswork Change Automation and Health Insights 3.2.2
Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine 1.2.1
You can deploy Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway as a VM on a host that meets the following minimum requirements:
Table 2. Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway VM requirements
Requirement
Description
Hypervisor
VMware vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3g or later (ESXi 6.7 Update 1 installed on hosts)
VMware vCenter Server 6.5 Update 2d or later (ESXi 6.5 Update 2 installed on hosts)
Memory
32 GB
Disk space
50 GB
vCPU
8 vCPUs
Interfaces
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 3
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway 1.1.3 can be deployed with either 1, 2, or 3 interfaces as per the combinations below:

Device Access Traffic
Control/Data Traffic

Management Traffic
Device Access Traffic
Control/Data Traffic
Management traffic: for accessing the UIs and command line and passing Control/Data information between servers (for example, Cisco Crosswork Change Automation and Health Insights to Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway or NSO).
Device access traffic: for device configuration and management (NSO or Cisco Crosswork Change Automation and Health Insights to the devices as a result of KPI configuration or playbook execution) and telemetry data being forwarded to the Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway.
Control/Data traffic: for data and configuration transfer between Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway and Cisco Crosswork Change Automation and Health Insights and other data destinations.
IP Addresses
1, 2, or 3 IPv4/IPv6 addresses based on the number of interfaces you choose to use.
Note 
Crosswork does not support dual stack configurations. Therefore, ALL addresses for the environment must be either IPv4 or IPv6.
NTP Servers
The IPv4/IPv6 addresses or host names of the NTP servers you plan to use. If you want to enter multiple NTP servers, separate them with spaces. These should be the same NTP servers you use to synchronize devices, clients, and servers across your network. Confirm that the NTP IP address or host name is reachable on the network or installation will fail.
Also, the ESXi hosts that will run the Cisco Crosswork Change Automation and Health Insights and Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway VM must have NTP configured, or the initial handshake may fail with "certificate not valid" errors.
DNS Servers
The IPv4/IPv6 addresses of the DNS servers you plan to use. These should be the same DNS servers you use to resolve host names across your network.
DNS Search Domain
The search domain you want to use with the DNS servers (for example, cisco.com). You can only have one search domain.
Destination Networks
For live deployments, we recommend one virtual switch for the Data Network (connection between the Cisco Crosswork Change Automation and Health Insights VM and the Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway VM) and second virtual switch for all the management traffic (vms to dns, ntp and the network you will use to access and manage the applications).
Tested Cisco OS

Note
The below table lists only the software versions with which Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway 1.1.3 was tested.

Features and Enhancements in Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway 1.1.3
This section lists the features/functionalities delivered in Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway 1.1.3:
Feature
Description
Collectors
CLI
SNMP
and SNMP Traps
MDT
Supports multiple data collection methods:
CLI-based collection
SNMP v1.0, v2c, v3.0 Collector with OID, MIB Walk, and Table support
Also, enables handling SNMP traps.
Note 
SNMP v2 and v3 are supported only for traps.
SNMP v3 traps support is limited to no auth and no priv.
MDT-based collection from network devices using the following transport mode:
TCP Dial-out Mode
Collection Optimization
Optimizes collection requests to reduce redundant data collections.
External Data Destinations Support for third party application access to network data
Kafka
gRPC
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway supports Kafka and gRPC servers to be used as external data destinations for collected data.
Secure communication between Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway and specified data destination
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway allows you to enable secure communication between itself and the specified data destination i.e., a Crosswork application or external Kafka.
Accessing SCP server via a custom port
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway allows you to use a custom port instead of the default SCP Port 22.
You can specify the port as a part of the SCP command. For example,
-P55 user@host:path/to/file
where 55 is a custom port.
SNMP Column Walk
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway allows you to provide either a Table OID or a Column OID for TABLE operation.
Collection Job Monitoring
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway provides central visibility into services collecting data and type of data being collected.
Custom Device Package Support
Allows third party device data collection by means of custom device packages. Lets you deploy three types of custom packages:
CLI Device Package
SNMP MIB Package
SNMP Device Package
Collection Vitals
Exposes vitals of its services allowing you to monitor overall health of Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway The vitals include Base VM performance metrics and reachability if each instance.
Load Monitoring
Cisco Crosswork Data Gateway provides report of its available bandwidth and performance. This includes Network I/O, Disk I/O, Memory, and CPU utilization.
Centralized logging
Lets you use an external syslog server.
Enhanced support in CLI Device Packs for third party
Enhanced support for 3rd party devices. CLI reachability uses custom device packages to check the reachability of devices with different protocols, such as SSH, TELNET, SNMP, and NETCONF.
