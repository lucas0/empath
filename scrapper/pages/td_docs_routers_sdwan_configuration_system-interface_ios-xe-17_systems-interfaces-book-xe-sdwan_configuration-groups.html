Configuration Groups and Feature Profiles
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.8.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.8.1
This feature provides a simple, reusable, and structured approach for the configurations in Cisco SD-WAN. You can create a configuration group, that is, a logical grouping of features or configurations that can be applied to one or more devices in the network managed by Cisco SD-WAN. You can also create profiles based on features that are required, recommended, or uniquely used, and then combine the profiles to complete a device configuration.
The configuration group workflow in Cisco vManage provides a guided method to create configuration groups and feature profiles.

Overview of Configuration Groups
The Configuration Group feature provides a simple, reusable, and structured approach for the configurations in Cisco SD-WAN.
Configuration Group: A configuration group is a logical grouping of features or configurations that can be applied to one or more devices in the network managed by Cisco SD-WAN. You can define and customize this grouping based on your business needs.
Feature Profile: A feature profile is a flexible building block of configurations that can be reused across different configuration groups. You can create profiles based on features that are required, recommended, or uniquely used, and then put together the profiles to complete a device configuration.
Feature: A feature profile consists of features. Features are the individual capabilities you want to share across different configuration groups.
Overview of Configuration Group Workflows
From Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1, the simplified Create Configuration Group workflow guides you in creating a configuration group for a single-router site. The workflow provides you with an improved configuration and troubleshooting experience. The workflow has the following features:
You can specify a name and description for a configuration group and configure the basic settings to keep your network running.
In addition to the basic settings, you can also configure advanced options at the time of creating a configuration group. For example, you can set up WAN and LAN routing; you can configure a BGP route, multiple static IPv4 routes, or both, for the WAN transport VPN. Similarly, you can configure a BGP route, an OSPF route, multiple static IPv4 routes, or all these routes, for a LAN service VPN. Thus, you can configure all the necessary options at the time of creating the configuration group itself, and do not have to modify the features separately after the group is created. As a result, any configuration created from the workflow is immediately deployable.
You can review the various configuration settings on a single page within the workflow.
When you specify an incorrect setting, it is highlighted in red. As a result, you can easily identify errors, if any, and fix them. In addition, an asterisk adjacent to the field names helps you identify the mandatory settings within the workflow.
You can access the workflow from the Workflow Library in Cisco vManage.

Note
In Cisco vManage Release 20.8.x, the Rapid Site Configuration Group and the Custom Configuration Group workflows enabled you to create a configuration group. However, these workflows are deprecated from Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1.
Overview of the Deploy Configuration Group Workflow
The Deploy Configuration Group workflow enables you to associate devices to a configuration group and to deploy the configuration to the selected devices.

Note
In Cisco vManage Release 20.8.x, the Deploy Configuration Group workflow is called the Provision WAN Sites and Devices workflow.
You can access the workflow from the Workflow Library in Cisco vManage.
Benefits of Configuration Groups
Simplicity: The workflow-based configuration guides you with step-by-step instructions. You can clearly identify what is necessary, what is optional, and what is the recommended Cisco networking best practice.
In addition, the basic and advanced settings of a configuration group are auto-populated, which in turn, simplifies the process of a configuration.
Day-zero Deployment: The day-zero setup of configuration groups helps you easily create a branch and deploy devices quickly.
Reusability: You can reuse configuration components across an entire device family instead of one device model. This helps in easier management of configuration components.
Structure: You can group devices based on a shared configuration in Cisco vManage.
Visibility: A site-level topology is generated for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices that are attached to a configuration group. For complete information about viewing the topology of a site, see View Network Site Topology.
Findability: The tagging feature helps you easily identify a subset of devices from hundreds of devices in a configuration group. For complete information about adding tags to devices, see Device Tagging.
Supported Devices for Configuration Groups
This feature is supported only on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
Prerequisites for Configuration Groups
Minimum software version for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.8.1a

Note
The downward compatibility support is till Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a
Minimum software version for Cisco vManage: Cisco vManage Release 20.8.1
Restrictions for Configuration Groups
You can associate a device to either a configuration group or a device template, but not both.
You can add a device to only one configuration group.
You can add only one tag rule to a configuration group.
Use Cases for Configuration Groups
You can create configuration groups according to your business needs. For example, if your organization operates in North America and has offices and network infrastructure on both the West Coast and the East Coast, you can create two configuration groupsâ€”the East Coast Configuration Group and the West Coast Configuration Group.
The following figure shows that both the East Coast Configuration Group and the West Coast Configuration Group use the same system profile and service profile. The transport profile is different for both the groups.
Figure 1. Example of Configuration Groups
In this figure,
The East Coast Configuration Group and the West Coast Configuration Group are examples of configuration groups. Similarly, a supply chain organization can create configuration groups for different facilities, such as a retail store configuration group and a distribution center configuration group. A multinational company can create configuration groups to cater to its business needs in different regions, such as the Americas Configuration Group and the EMEA Configuration Group.
System profile, transport profile, and service profile are examples of feature profiles.
Logging; Banner; interfaces, such as MPLS, LTE, and Internet; VPN1; VPN2; and so on are examples of features.

Examples of Applying Rules Using Tags
Examples of Applying Rules Using Tags
Scenario: There are five devices in the network, and you want to add the devices to configuration groups based on tagging.
Tag each device. For information about tagging devices, see Add Tags to Devices Using Cisco vManage.
In the following example, tags have been added to five Cisco Catalyst 8000V devices.
Table 2. Example of Device Tagging
Device UUID
Tags
C8K-0001
CA1, CA2
C8K-0002
CA1, CA2, CA3
C8K-0003
CA1, CA4, CA5
C8K-0004
CA3, CA4
C8K-0005
CA3, CA5
Use rules to add the devices to specific configuration groups based on the tags that you have added to each device.
When applying a rule, you can use the following operators:
Equal: This operator checks for matching data.
Not equal: This operator checks for nonmatching data.
Contain: This operator finds a value anywhere in your data.
Not contain: This operator filters data that does not contain any of the specified values.
For information about using rules to add devices to configuration groups, see Add Devices to a Configuration Group Using Rules.
The following examples show the effects of using different operators when applying a rule, based on how devices are tagged.
Rule Example 1
Operator: EQUAL
Specified tags: CA1, CA2
Effect: Matches any device containing these two tags.
Configuration group: A
Result: Devices C8K-0001 and C8K-0002 are added to configuration group A.
Rule Example 2
Operator: NOT EQUAL
Specified tags: CA1, CA2
Effect: Matches any device that does not contain both of these tags.
Configuration group: B
Result: Devices C8K-0003, C8K-0004, and C8K-0005 are added to configuration group B.
Rule Example 3
Operator: CONTAIN
Specified tags: CA1, CA2
Effect: Matches any device that contains any one of these tags.
Configuration group: C
Result: Devices C8K-0001, C8K-0002, and C8K-0003 are added to configuration group C.
Rule Example 4
Operator: NOT CONTAIN
Specified tags: CA1, CA2
Effect: Matches any device that does not contain any one of these tags.
Configuration group: D
Result: Devices C8K-0004 and C8K-0005 are added to configuration group D.

AAA
The authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) feature helps the device authenticate users logging in to the Cisco SD-WAN router, decide what permissions to give them, and perform accounting of their actions.
For each parameter of the feature that has a default value, the scope is set to Default (indicated by a check mark), and the default setting or value is shown. To change the default or to enter a value, click the scope drop-down to the left of the parameter field and choose one of the following:
Parameter Scope
Scope Description
Device Specific (indicated by a host icon)
Use a device-specific value for the parameter. For device-specific parameters, you cannot enter a value in the feature template. You enter the value when you attach a Cisco SD-WAN device to a device template.
When you click Device Specific, the Enter Key box opens. This box displays a key, which is a unique string that identifies the parameter in a CSV file that you create. This file is an Excel spreadsheet that contains one column for each key. The header row contains the key names (one key per column), and each row after that corresponds to a device and defines the values of the keys for that device. You upload the CSV file when you attach a Cisco SD-WAN device to a device template.
To change the default key, type a new string and move the cursor out of the Enter Key box.
Examples of device-specific parameters are system IP address, host name, GPS location, and site ID.
Global (indicated by a globe icon)
Enter a value for the parameter, and apply that value to all devices.
Examples of parameters that you might apply globally to a group of devices are DNS server, syslog server, and interface MTUs.

IPsec Private IP-Pool
The Private IP-Pool pane allows you to specify the size of the private IP pool to allocate to a device from the global IP pool for the remote access defined in the Network Hierarchy. The device uses the private IP pool to assign an IP address to each remote access client.
If you enable the remote-access feature through create Configuration Group workflow, it creates global IPv4 pool in Network Hierarchy for remote access use. In Cisco vManage Release 20.11.1, if you want to enable the IPv6 pool for remote-access feature, you must create IPv6 pool manually in the Network Hierarchy. You can edit the remote access feature in the configuration groups to update the pool size.
To release the IP pool allocated to a device, you need to remove the remote access feature, disable remote-access in the service VPN, and successfully deploy the configuration group to the device. Then the IPv4 and IPv6 pools allocated to a device are returned to the global IPv4 and IPv6 pool for remote access, in the Network Hierarchy. The global remote access pools reflect the latest capacity.
Field
Description

IP Directed Broadcast
An IP directed broadcast is an IP packet whose destination address is a valid broadcast address for some IP subnet, but which originates from a node that is not itself part of that destination subnet.
A device that is not directly connected to its destination subnet forwards an IP directed broadcast in the same way it would forward unicast IP packets destined to a host on that subnet. When a directed broadcast packet reaches a device that is directly connected to its destination subnet, that packet is broadcast on the destination subnet. The destination address in the IP header of the packet is rewritten to the configured IP broadcast address for the subnet, and the packet is sent as a link-layer broadcast.
If directed broadcast is enabled for an interface, incoming IP packets whose addresses identify them as directed broadcasts intended for the subnet to which that interface is attached are broadcast on that subnet.
ICMP Redirect Disable
ICMP redirects are sent by a router to the sender of an IP packet when a packet is being routed sub-optimally. The ICMP redirect informs the sending host to forward subsequent packets to that same destination through a different gateway.
By default, an interface allows ICMP redirect messages.

TLOC Extension
Enter the name of a physical interface on the same router that connects to the WAN transport. This configuration then binds this service-side interface to the WAN transport. A second router at the same site that itself has no direct connection to the WAN (generally because the site has only a single WAN connection) and that connects to this service-side interface is then provided with a connection to the WAN.
Note
  TLOC extension over L3 is supported only for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. If configuring TLOC extension over L3 for a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device, enter the IP address of the L3 interface.
Tracker
Tracking the interface status is useful when you enable NAT on a transport interface in VPN 0 to allow data traffic from the router to exit directly to the internet rather than having to first go to a router in a data center. In this situation, enabling NAT on the transport interface splits the TLOC between the local router and the data center into two, with one going to the remote router and the other going to the internet.
When you enable transport tunnel tracking, Cisco SD-WAN periodically probes the path to the internet to determine whether it is up. If Cisco SD-WAN detects that this path is down, it withdraws the route to the internet destination, and traffic destined to the internet is then routed through the data center router. When Cisco SD-WAN detects that the path to the internet is again functioning, the route to the internet is reinstalled.
Enter the name of a tracker to track the status of transport interfaces that connect to the internet.
IP Directed-Broadcast
An IP directed broadcast is an IP packet whose destination address is a valid broadcast address for some IP subnet but which originates from a node that is not itself part of that destination subnet.
A device that is not directly connected to its destination subnet forwards an IP directed broadcast in the same way it would forward unicast IP packets destined to a host on that subnet. When a directed broadcast packet reaches a device that is directly connected to its destination subnet, that packet is broadcast on the destination subnet. The destination address in the IP header of the packet is rewritten to the configured IP broadcast address for the subnet, and the packet is sent as a link-layer broadcast.
If directed broadcast is enabled for an interface, incoming IP packets whose addresses identify them as directed broadcasts intended for the subnet to which that interface is attached are broadcast on that subnet.
BGP Routing
This feature helps you configure the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing in VPN 0 or the WAN VPN.
For each parameter of the feature that has a default value, the scope is set to Default (indicated by a check mark), and the default setting or value is shown. To change the default or to enter a value, click the scope drop-down to the left of the parameter field and choose one of the following:

The device requests the identity of the supplicant and starts relaying authentication messages between the supplicant and the authentication server. Each supplicant attempting to access the network is uniquely identified by the device by using the supplicant MAC address.
force-unauthorized: Causes the port to remain in the unauthorized state, ignoring all attempts by the supplicant to authenticate. The device cannot provide authentication services to the supplicant through the port.
force-authorized: Disables IEEE 802.1X authentication and causes the port to change to the authorized state without any authentication exchange required. The port sends and receives normal traffic without IEEE 802.1X-based authentication of the client.

ICMP Redirect Disable
ICMP redirects are sent by a router to the sender of an IP packet when a packet is being routed sub-optimally. The ICMP redirect informs the sending host to forward subsequent packets to that same destination through a different gateway.
By default, an interface allows ICMP redirect messages.
XConnect
Enter the name of a physical interface on the same router that connects to the WAN transport.
IP Directed Broadcast
An IP directed broadcast is an IP packet whose destination address is a valid broadcast address for some IP subnet but which originates from a node that is not itself part of that destination subnet.
A device that is not directly connected to its destination subnet forwards an IP directed broadcast in the same way it would forward unicast IP packets destined to a host on that subnet. When a directed broadcast packet reaches a device that is directly connected to its destination subnet, that packet is broadcast on the destination subnet. The destination address in the IP header of the packet is rewritten to the configured IP broadcast address for the subnet, and the packet is sent as a link-layer broadcast.
If directed broadcast is enabled for an interface, incoming IP packets whose addresses identify them as directed broadcasts intended for the subnet to which that interface is attached are broadcast on that subnet.

The Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN multicast overlay software extends Protocol Independent Multicast Source-Specific Multicast (PIM-SSM) over the Cisco SD-WAN overlay using Overlay Management Protocol (OMP). Protocol Independent Multicast Sparse-Mode (PIM-SM) is deployed in the customer VPNs, and the Cisco IOS XE MVPN is used to integrate PIM in customer VPNs and OMP in the overlay. The OMP replicator is used in overlay multicast to optimize the multicast distribution tree across the overlay topology. The Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN router supports IGMPv2 and IGMPv3 reports and advertises receiver's multicast interest to remote Cisco SD-WAN routers using OMP. Depending on the level of optimization required, the Cisco SD-WAN routers join or prune to or from the replicators, and replicators use OMP to relay the join or prune to the Cisco SD-WAN router providing overlay connectivity to the PIM-RP or source.
The Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN overlay multicast network supports the following protocols:
Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)
Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP)

This file is an Excel spreadsheet that contains one column for each key. The header row contains the key names (one key per column), and each row after that corresponds to a device and defines the values of the keys for that device. You upload the CSV file when you attach a Cisco SD-WAN device to a device template.
To change the default key, type a new string and move the cursor out of the Enter Key box.
Examples of device-specific parameters are system IP address, host name, GPS location, and site ID.
