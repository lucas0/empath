CSCvv72609 SmartLicense: High CPU usage triggered by RUM reports
CSCwa85199 Unacknowledged Reports can cause High CPU Utilization due to Smart Agent
CSCwa85525 Memory leak in *MallocLite* due to growing Smart Agent Memory Utilization
Problem Description
For affected versions of the Cisco IOS® XE software, devices might report high CPU or memory usage. In some scenarios, devices might report both high CPU and memory usage.
This issue is seen only when the "Smart Licensing Using Policy" feature is implemented on the device.
Background
This issue is seen when the "Smart Licensing Using Policy" feature is implemented, and Resource Utilization Measurement (RUM) reports are accumulated in large quantities on the device.
The underlying reason for the accumulation could be a communication issue between the device and Cisco Smart Software Manager (CSSM). When RUM reports do not get the required acknowledgement, they accumulate on the device and can cause high CPU/memory usage.
Problem Symptom
The underlying reason for the RUM report accumulation could be a communication issue between the device and Cisco Smart Software Manager (CSSM).
This error log might be observed in the affected device:
%SMART_LIC-3-COMM_FAILED: Communications failure with the Cisco Smart Software Manager (CSSM) : Communications failure
This issue can occur when there is an increasing trend of accumulated RUM reports in the device. The increasing trend of accumulated RUM reports can be viewed with multiple iterations of these commands:
Sample output is shown here:
system#license smart save usage all file flash:report.txt

system#more flash:report.txt | count RUMReport

Number of lines which match regexp = 214 <<<< This counter may increase over multiple iterations
Cisco has observed that at 1000 RUM reports, high CPU/memory usage might be seen. This value, however, is not fixed and will vary depending on network conditions and topology. It is highly recommended that the mitigation steps (see the Workaround/Solution section) are taken as soon as RUM reports start to accumulate.
For high CPU, the processes “SAGetRUMIds” and “SAUtilRepSave” will be seen.
Sample output is shown here:
system#show processes cpu sorted

CPU utilization for five seconds: 99%/99%; one minute: 99%; five minutes: 99%

For high memory usage, there will be an increasing trend in memory held by the “MallocLite” process.

Workaround/Solution
Workaround  
The underlying reason for the RUM report accumulation could be a communication issue between the device and CSSM. Ensure that the underlying connectivity operates as expected for your network as per the smart licensing implementation.
Either of these workarounds can be implemented in order to temporarily resolve the issue:
Clean Up RUM Report Accumulation
Enter the license smart factory reset command followed by a device reload with the reload command.
system#license smart factory reset

%Warning: reload required after "license smart factory reset" command

system#reload
Manual Sync of RUM Reports
The RUM reports can be manually synced with CSSM. For instructions on how to manually sync the RUM Reports, see Uploading Data or Requests to CSSM and Downloading a File.
Solution
In order to resolve this issue, upgrade to one of these fixed Cisco IOS XE software releases:
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.7 or later
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.5 or later
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.9.1 or later
The software can be downloaded from the Cisco Software Download website.
Cisco strongly recommends that customers review the software download page for the current recommended starred releases and upgrade to those releases.
