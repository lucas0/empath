Introduction
This document describes how to configure a Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) that runs software Version 9.x for the use of two internal networks.
Prerequisites
Requirements
There are no specific requirements for this document.
Components Used
The information in this document is based on the Cisco ASA that runs software Version 9.x.
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Conventions
Refer to the Cisco Technical Tips Conventions for more information on document conventions.
Background Information
When you add a second internal network behind an ASA firewall, consider this important information:
The ASA does not support secondary addressing.

A router must be used behind the ASA in order to achieve routing between the current network and the newly added network.

The default gateway for all of the hosts must point to the inside router.

You must add a default route on the inside router that points to the ASA.

You must clear the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache on the inside router.
Configure
Use the information that is described in this section in order to configure the ASA.
Network Diagram
Here is the topology that is used for the examples throughout this document:
Note: The IP addressing schemes that are used in this configuration are not legally routable on the Internet. They are RFC 1918 addresses that are used in a lab environment.
ASA 9.x Configuration
If you have the output of the write terminal command from your Cisco device, you can use the Output Interpreter tool (registered customers only) in order to display potential issues and fixes.
Here is the configuration for the ASA that runs software Version 9.x:

Allow Inside Hosts Access to Outside Networks with PAT
If you intend to have the inside hosts share a single public address for translation, use Port Address Translation (PAT). One of the simplest PAT configurations involves the translation of all internal hosts so that they appear to be the outside interface IP. This is the typical PAT configuration that is used when the number of routable IP addresses that are available from the ISP is limited to only a few, or just one.
Complete these steps in order to allow the inside hosts access to the outside networks with PAT:
Navigate to Configuration > Firewall > NAT Rules, click Add, and choose Network Object in order to configure a dynamic NAT rule:



Configure the network/Host/Range for which the Dynamic PAT is required. In this example, all inside subnets have been selected. This process should be repeated for the specific subnets that you wish to translate in this manner:



Click NAT, check the Add Automatic Address Translation Rule check box, enter Dynamic, and set the Translated Addr option so that it reflects the outside interface. If you click the ellipsis button, it assists you to pick a pre-configured object, such as the outside interface:



Click Advanced in order to select a source and destination interface:



Click OK, and then click Apply in order to apply the changes. Once complete, the Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) shows the NAT rule:

Verify
Access a web site via HTTP through a web browser in order to verify that your configuration works properly.
This example uses a site that is hosted at IP address 198.51.100.100. If the connection is successful, the outputs that are provided in the sections that follow can be seen on the ASA CLI.
Connection
Enter the show connection address command in order to verify the connection:
ASA(config)# show connection address 172.16.11.5
6 in use, 98 most used
TCP outside  198.51.100.100:80 inside  192.168.1.5:58799, idle 0:00:06, bytes 937,
flags UIO
The ASA is a stateful firewall, and the return traffic from the web server is allowed back through the firewall because it matches a connection in the firewall connection table. The traffic that matches a connection that preexists is allowed through the firewall without being blocked by an interface Access Control List (ACL).
In the previous output, the client on the inside interface has established a connection to the 198.51.100.100 host off of the outside interface. This connection is made with the TCP protocol and has been idle for six seconds. The connection flags indicate the current state of this connection.
Note: Refer to the ASA TCP Connection Flags (Connection build-up and teardown) Cisco document for more information about connection flags.
Troubleshoot
Use the information that is described in this section in order to troubleshoot configuration issues.
Syslogs
Enter the show log command in order to view the syslogs:
ASA(config)# show log | in 192.168.1.5

Apr 27 2014 11:31:23: %ASA-6-305011: Built dynamic TCP translation from inside:
192.168.1.5/58799 to outside:203.0.113.2/58799

Apr 27 2014 11:31:23: %ASA-6-302013: Built outbound TCP connection 2921 for outside:
198.51.100.100/80 (198.51.100.100/80) to inside:192.168.1.5/58799 (203.0.113.2/58799)
The ASA firewall generates syslogs during normal operation. The syslogs range in verbosity based on the logging configuration. The output shows two syslogs that are seen at level six, or the informational level.
In this example, there are two syslogs generated. The first is a log message to indicate that the firewall has built a translation; specifically, a dynamic TCP translation (PAT). It indicates the source IP address and port, as well as the translated IP address and port, as the traffic traverses from the inside to the outside interfaces.
The second syslog indicates that the firewall has built a connection in its connection table for this specific traffic between the client and server. If the firewall was configured in order to block this connection attempt, or some other factor inhibited the creation of this connection (resource constraints or a possible misconfiguration), the firewall does not generate a log to indicate that the connection was built. Instead, it logs a reason for the connection to be denied or an indication in regards to the factor that inhibited the connection from being created.
Packet Tracers
Enter this command in order to enable the packet tracer functionality:
ASA(config)# packet-tracer input inside tcp 192.168.1.5 1234 198.51.100.100 80 


--Omitted--

Result:
input-interface: inside
input-status: up
input-line-status: up
output-interface: outside
output-status: up
output-line-status: up
Action: allow
The packet tracer functionality on the ASA allows you to specify a simulated packet and view all of the various steps, checks, and functions that the firewall completes when it processes the traffic. With this tool, it is helpful to identify an example of the traffic that you believe should be allowed to pass through the firewall, and use that 5-tupple in order to simulate the traffic. In the previous example, the packet tracer is used in order to simulate a connection attempt that meets these criteria:
The simulated packet arrives on the inside interface.

The protocol that is used is TCP.

The simulated client IP address is 192.168.1.5.

The client sends traffic that is sourced from port 1234.

The traffic is destined to a server at IP address 198.51.100.100.

The traffic is destined to port 80.
Notice that there was no mention of the outside interface in the command. This is due to packet tracer design. The tool tells you how the firewall processes that type of connection attempt, which includes how it would route it, and out of which interface.
Tip: For more information about the packet tracer functionality, refer to the Tracing packets with Packet Tracer section of the Cisco ASA 5500 Series Configuration Guide using the CLI, 8.4 and 8.6.
Capture
Enter these commands in order to apply a capture:
ASA# capture capin interface inside match tcp host 192.168.1.5 host 198.51.100.100
ASA# capture capout interface outside match tcp any host 198.51.100.100
ASA#show capture capin

3 packets captured

   win 32768/pre>
The ASA firewall can capture the traffic that enters or leaves its interfaces. This capture functionality is fantastic because it can definitively prove whether the traffic arrives at, or leaves from, a firewall. The previous example shows the configuration of two captures named capin and capout on the inside and outside interfaces, respectively. The capture commands use the match keyword, which allows you to specify the traffic that you want to capture.
For the capin capture example, it is indicated that you want to match the traffic that is seen on the inside interface (ingress or egress) that matches tcp host 192.168.1.5 host 198.51.100.100. In other words, you want to capture any TCP traffic that is sent from host 192.168.1.5  to host 198.51.100.100, or vice versa. The use of the match keyword allows the firewall to capture that traffic bidirectionally. The capture command that is defined for the outside interface does not reference the internal client IP address because the firewall conducts PAT on that client IP address. As a result, you cannot match with that client IP address. Instead, this example uses any in order to indicate that all possible IP addresses would match that condition.
After you configure the captures, you can then attempt to establish a connection again and proceed to view the captures with the show capture<capture_name> command. In this example, you can see that the client is able to connect to the server, as evident by the TCP 3-way handshake that is seen in the captures.
