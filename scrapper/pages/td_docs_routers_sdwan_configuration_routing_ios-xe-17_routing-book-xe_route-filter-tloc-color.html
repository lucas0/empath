Cisco vSmart Controller Route Filtering by TLOC Color
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.11.1a
Cisco SD-WAN Controllers Release 20.11.1
Cisco vSmart controllers can reduce the number of routes that they advertise to routers in the network, to exclude routes that are not relevant to a particular device. The filtering to reduce the number of routes is based on the colors of TLOCs on each device. For example, a route to a public TLOC is not relevant to a router that only has private TLOCs. Advertising fewer routes helps to avoid reaching the send path limit for routers in the network.

Information About Cisco vSmart Controller Route Filtering by TLOC Color
Minimum releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.11.1a, Cisco SD-WAN Controllers Release 20.11.1
Using route filtering, Cisco vSmart controllers can reduce the number of routes that they advertise to routers in the network, to exclude routes that are not relevant to a particular device. The filtering is based on the colors of TLOCs on each device: For each individual router, the Cisco vSmart controller advertises only routes that are compatible with one or more of the router's TLOCs.
Benefits
Advertising fewer routes offers the following benefits:
Avoids reaching the send path limit:
Cisco vSmart controller route filtering by TLOC color helps to avoid reaching the send path limit for routers in the network. For example, the send path limit might be set to 32, but Cisco vSmart controllers might have more than 32 routes for a particular prefix to advertise to a device. Filtering out irrelevant routes helps to avoid reaching the limit.
Prioritizes relevant routes:
If the send path limit is set to a low value, X, and if there are many routes to advertise, a Cisco vSmart controller might advertise X irrelevant routes to a device, reaching the send path limit before advertising any relevant routes. This could result in a routing failure. Advertising only relevant routes prevents this possible failure.
Default Behavior
Cisco vSmart controller route filtering by TLOC color is disabled by default.
Logic
Cisco vSmart controllers apply the following logic when determining whether routes are compatible:
A TLOC with a public color can resolve a path to a route for a TLOC with a public color on a peer device.
A TLOC of a particular color can resolve a path to a route for a TLOC of the same color on a peer device.
A TLOC with a public color cannot resolve a path with a TLOC in a private color set.
Public colors include default, biz-internet, public-internet, lte, 3g, red, green, blue, gold, silver, bronze, custom1, custom2, and so on. Private colors include mpls, metro-ethernet, private1, private2, and so on. For information about private and public TLOC colors, see Unicast Overlay Routing in the Cisco SD-WAN Routing Configuration Guide, Cisco IOS XE Release 17.x.
For example, if a router has only TLOCs with private colors, Cisco vSmart controllers do not advertise public routes to the device. Similarly, if a router has only TLOCs with public colors, Cisco vSmart controllers do not advertise private routes to the device. The following illustration provides a more detailed example:
Figure 1. Cisco vSmart Controller Route Filtering by TLOC Color, With the Feature Enabled
If you change the color assignment of a TLOC, the device updates the Cisco vSmart controllers, enabling them to adjust the Cisco vSmart controller route filtering by TLOC color accordingly.
Override
You can override the default logic if necessary and do one of the following:
Configure two TLOC colors to be compatible even if they are incompatible by default.
Configure two TLOC colors to be incompatible even if they are compatible by default.
This may be helpful in specific unconventional scenarios. See the tloc-color-compatibility command in Override Default TLOC Color Compatibility for Cisco vSmart Controller Route Filtering by TLOC Color Using a CLI Template.
The following illustration shows an example of route filtering by TLOC color, with two overrides:
Configure green and gold to be incompatible.
Configure mpls and private1 to be compatible.

Updating Cisco vSmart Controllers of Changes
Routers in the network update Cisco vSmart controllers when the status of their TLOCs changes. This may include reconfiguring a TLOC to a different color.
To account for temporary unavailability of a TLOC due to flapping, there is a dampening interval to delay reporting changes of TLOC status. By default, it is 60 seconds, but it can be configured to a value from 60 to 1200 seconds. For information, see Configure the Update Interval for Route Filtering by TLOC Color Using a CLI Template.
Supported Devices for Cisco vSmart Controller Route Filtering by TLOC Color
Minimum releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.11.1a, Cisco SD-WAN Controllers Release 20.11.1
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices
Prerequisites for Cisco vSmart Controller Route Filtering by TLOC Color
Minimum releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.11.1a, Cisco SD-WAN Controllers Release 20.11.1
For Cisco vSmart controllers to determine the compatibility of paths, the colors of TLOCs must be configured according to convention. For example, a TLOC handling an MPLS connection must have the color mpls.
Restrictions for Cisco vSmart Controller Route Filtering by TLOC Color
Minimum releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.11.1a, Cisco SD-WAN Controllers Release 20.11.1
When you enable Cisco vSmart controller route filtering by TLOC color in a network, ensure that all you enable it on all Cisco vSmart controllers in the network. We do not support scenarios in which route filtering by TLOC color is enabled on some Cisco vSmart controllers and disabled on others within the same network.

Monitor Cisco vSmart Controller Route Filtering by TLOC Color
The following sections describe how to monitor Cisco vSmart controller route filtering by TLOC color.
View TLOC Colors for a Device
Check TLOC Color Compatibility
View TLOC Colors for a Device
Minimum releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.11.1a, Cisco SD-WAN Controllers Release 20.11.1
To view the list of the TLOC colors that a device advertises to Cisco vSmart controllers, use the show support omp peer peer-ip command on a Cisco vSmart controller. When applying route filtering, the controllers use this TLOC color information to determine which routes are relevant to a device.
The following example shows the TLOC colors that the peer device 10.0.0.15 is advertising—in this case, lte and 3g.
vmanage#show support omp peer peer-ip 10.0.0.15 | inc color
ed bitmap: 0xc0, TLOC color supported list: lte 3g
Check TLOC Color Compatibility
Minimum releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.11.1a, Cisco SD-WAN Controllers Release 20.11.1
To check the compatibility of TLOC colors, use the request support omp tloc-color-compat command.
The following example requests information about whether the 3g and lte colors are compatible. These are both public TLOC colors, so they are compatible:
vsmart# request support omp tloc-color-compat 3g lte 
Checking compatibility for colors:3g and lte 
TLOC colors: 3g and lte are compatible 
The following examples requests information about whether the 3g and mpls TLOC colors are compatible. They are incompatible:
vsmart# request support omp tloc-color-compat 3g mpls
Checking compatibility for colors:3g and mpls 
TLOC colors: 3g and mpls are incompatible
