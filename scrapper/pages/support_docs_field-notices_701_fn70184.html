Defect ID Headline
CSCvj05190 Incorrect US power cable (CAB-US515P-C19-US) ordered with the 3200W PSU (C9400-PWR-3200AC)
Problem Description
A system error allowed a limited number of customers to order an incorrect power cable with their Catalyst 9400 10-slot and 7-slot switches. This option was incorrectly available with the 3200W AC power supply.
Background
Due to an incorrect configuration of the ordering tool, customer choices for the power cable included item CAB-US515P-C19-US (NEMA 5-15 to IEC-C19 13ft US), which is not suitably rated for the 3200W AC power supply.
Problem Symptom
If the chassis configuration is such that high-load current is required from the power supply, use of the CAB-US515P-C19-US power cable is not designed or approved to support the required current rating. Use of the incorrect power cable under such conditions could potentially result in damage to the power cord from abnormal heating.
Workaround/Solution
Cisco requires that affected customers replace the power cord CAB-US515P-C19-US with a suitably rated power cord, CAB-US520-C19-US=. Customers can order the replacement power cord in Support Case Manager at no charge. Add the Serial Number for the chassis this replacement power cord will go into when you complete the order in Support Case Manager.
Customers can reach out to the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their Account team for any assistance.
Notes:
The number of replacement power cables ordered should equal the number of power supplies in the chassis.
The customer is requested to dispose of any incorrect CAB-US515P-C19-US cables or return them to Cisco in order to avoid inadvertent use of the impacted cable in the future.
