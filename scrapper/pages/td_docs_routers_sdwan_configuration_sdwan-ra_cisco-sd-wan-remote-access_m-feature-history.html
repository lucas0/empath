Description
Cisco SD-WAN Remote Access
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1
Remote access refers to enabling secure access to an organization's network from devices at remote locations.
Cisco SD-WAN remote access (SD-WAN RA) integrates remote access functionality into Cisco SD-WAN. SD-WAN RA enables Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices to function as RA headends, managed through Cisco vManage. This eliminates the need for separate Cisco SD-WAN and RA infrastructure, and enables rapid scalability of RA services.
RA users can use the same software- or hardware-based RA clients as with solutions that do not integrate with Cisco SD-WAN. For RA users, benefits include extending Cisco SD-WAN features to remote users. RA users can access applications hosted on-premises, applications hosted in IaaS, SaaS applications, or the internet.
Cisco SD-WAN Remote Access Configuration Using Cisco vManage
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.11.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.11.1
This feature enables you to configure Cisco SD-WAN Remote Access for a device, using Cisco vManage. Configure Remote Access using the System feature profile in a configuration group.

Feature
Description
RA VPN mode
Internet key exchange version 2 (IKEv2) and the internet protocol security (IPsec) protocol suite.
Supported RA clients
SD-WAN RA enables Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices to terminate IKEv2/IPsec VPN connections from the following types of client:
Software: Cisco AnyConnect
Hardware: Cisco IOS-XE router functioning as a small office/home office (SOHO) RA client
Note
  RA clients must be pre-configured with the DNS names or public IP addresses of the primary and backup SD-WAN RA headends.
Supported platforms for the SD-WAN RA headend
Cisco Catalyst 8300-1N1S-6T
Cisco Catalyst 8300-2N2S-4T2X
Cisco Catalyst 8500-12X
Cisco Catalyst 8500-12X4QC
Cisco Catalyst 8500L
Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge Software
Supported Certificate authority (CA) servers
Any simple certificate enrollment protocol (SCEP)-capable CA server.
The CA server provisions certificates on the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices that enable the RA headend to authenticate itself to RA clients when the headend is configured to use certificate-based authentication.
It is common for the CA server to be deployed at a data center site in the service VPN, together with the RADIUS server.
Authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) management
RADIUS/extensible authentication protocol (EAP) server for authentication of RA clients and for per-user policy management.
It is common for the RADIUS server to be deployed at a data center site, together with the CA server.
Configuration method
Cisco vManage CLI template
Monitoring
Monitoring is through show commands and syslogs on the RA headend devices.
