Objective
This document discusses the licensing requirements for proper use of the AnyConnect functionality supported by the RV340 series routers. This article has been updated to note the licensing changes present in firmware version 1.0.3.15.
Applicable Devices
RV340 Series
Introduction
With the introduction of the RV340 series routers comes an exciting new feature to the Small Business platform, AnyConnect connectivity. For businesses already using AnyConnect and are wanting to implement an RV340 series router as an edge device for a remote site, this feature allows the ability to use the same software stack to create VPN tunnels as would be used with Enterprise equipment.
Licensing Structure - Firmware versions 1.0.3.15 and later
Moving forward, AnyConnect will incur a charge for client licenses only.
Licensing Structure - Firmware versions 1.0.2.16 or lower
If you have not yet updated your firmware, please do so now. Click here to visit the downloads page for the RV34X series. The server licenses for the old version are no longer available to purchase since it is no longer needed.
What Licenses Are Required?
AnyConnect client licenses, which allow use of the AnyConnect desktop clients as well as any of the AnyConnect mobile clients that are available.
The RV340 series routers come with 2 AnyConnect server licenses by default, meaning that customers who have AnyConnect client licenses already can establish 2 VPN tunnels simultaneously with any RV340 series router.
For those that do not have AnyConnect client licenses already, the licenses must be purchased.
It is important to have a Cisco account before you order a license. An account can be created by visiting software.cisco.com. When creating an account, if you are required to enter a Domain and you do not have one, you can enter your email address in the form of name@domain.com. Once you have an account, you can purchase a license from your Cisco partner.
If you don’t have a Cisco partner, you can locate one here.
If you would like more details on ordering, check out the Cisco AnyConnect Ordering Guide.
At the time of writing, the following Product SKUs can be used to purchase additional licenses in bundles of 25. Note that there are other options for the AnyConnect client licenses as outlined in the Cisco AnyConnect Ordering Guide, however the Product ID listed would be the minimum requirement for full functionality.
Please note, the AnyConnect client license Product SKU listed first, provides licenses for a term of 1 year, and requires a minimum purchase of 25 licenses. Other product SKUs which are applicable to the RV340 series routers are also available with varying subscription levels, as follows:
AC-PLS-1YR-25 — 1 year Cisco AnyConnect Plus client license 25 Users
AC-PLS-3YR-25 — 3 year Cisco AnyConnect Plus client license 25 Users
