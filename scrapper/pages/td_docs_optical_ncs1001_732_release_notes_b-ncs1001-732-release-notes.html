What's New in Cisco NCS 1001, IOS XR Release 7.3.2
Cisco is continuously enhancing the product with every release and this section covers a brief description of key features and enhancements. It also includes links to detailed documentation, where available.
Feature Description
Hardware
ONS-SE-155-1510 Support
A new SFP pluggable optics module with PID ONS-SE-155-1510 SFP is supported.
Configuration
OTDR ML (Machine Learning) Model
The OTDR ML (Machine Learning) model is updated for this release to Version 4. This new model improves performance on events recognition.
OC support for AAA User
This feature allows all authorized users on XR VM to access administration data on the router through NETCONF or gRPC interface, similar to accessing the CLI. This functionality works by internally mapping the task group of the user on XR VM to a predefined group on System Admin VM. Therefore, the NETCONF and gRPC users can access the administrative information on the router even if their user profiles do not exist on System Admin VM.
Command added:
aaa authorization (System Admin-VM)
