Chapter: About the Firepower 1000/2100 and Secure Firewall 3100 Security Appliance CLI
Chapter Contents
This troubleshooting guide explains the Firepower eXstensible Operating System (FXOS) command line interface (CLI) for the Firepower 1000 , Firepower 2100, and Secure Firewall 3100 security appliance series.

Note
The CLI on the SSH client management port defaults to Secure Firewall Threat Defense. You can get to the FXOS CLI using the connect fxos command.
The CLI on the Firepower 1000/2100 and Secure Firewall 3100 console port defaults to the FXOS CLI prompt. You can get to the threat defense CLI using the connect ftd command.
Once logged into the FXOS CLI, you can use the commands described below to view and troubleshoot the FXOS platform for your Firepower 1000, Firepower 2100, or Secure Firewall 3100 series device.
If threat defense is installed on your Firepower 1000/2100 or Secure Firewall 3100 device, the FXOS CLI does not allow you to modify the configuration. If you attempt to perform any configuration changes with the FXOS CLI, the commit-buffer command returns an error.
For more information about the threat defense CLI, see the Command Reference for threat defense.
FXOS CLI Hierarchy

FXOS CLI Hierarchy
The FXOS CLI is organized into a hierarchy of command modes, with the EXEC mode being the highest-level mode of the hierarchy. Higher-level modes branch into lower-level modes. You use create , enter , and scope commands to move from higher-level modes to modes in the next lower level , and you use the exit command to move up one level in the mode hierarchy. You can also use the top command to move to the top level in the mode hierarchy.
Each mode contains a set of commands that can be entered in that mode. Most of the commands available in each mode pertain to the associated managed object.
The CLI prompt for each mode shows the full path down the mode hierarchy to the current mode. This helps you to determine where you are in the command mode hierarchy, and it can be an invaluable tool when you need to navigate through the hierarchy.
The following table lists the main command modes, the commands used to access each mode, and the CLI prompt associated with each mode.

At any time, you can type the ? character to display the options available at the current state of the command syntax.
If you have not typed anything at the prompt, typing ? lists all available commands for the mode you are in. If you have partially typed a command, typing ? lists all available keywords and arguments available at your current position in the command syntax.
