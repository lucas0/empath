Features and Capabilities
Algo Boost technology allows the Cisco Nexus 3548/3548-X to achieve exceptionally low latencies of 250 nanoseconds (ns) or less for all workloads. That includes unicast and multicast, and layer 2 and 3 switching, regardless of the features applied.
Benefits include:
Warp mode to further reduce latency to 190 ns for small-to-midsize layer 2 and 3 deployments
Warp SPAN to help enable stock market data delivery to trading servers in as little as 50 ns
Active Buffer Monitoring to help you take advantage of market volatility and handle micro bursts
Technology that supports Network Address Translation (NAT) for trade execution on any venue, without a latency penalty
Embedded Remote SPAN with nanosecond timestamps to help you monitor your traffic with superior precision
Multicast NAT and latency monitoring leading to simplified co-location integration and enhanced traffic visibility and troubleshooting (only 3548-X model).
Next generation 3548-X offers lower power consumption further lowering operational cost
Comprehensive Feature Set with Cisco Nexus Operating System (NX-OS)
