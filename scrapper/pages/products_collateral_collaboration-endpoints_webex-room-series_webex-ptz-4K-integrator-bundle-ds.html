    The Webex® Room Kit Pro PTZ 4K Integrator Bundle is a powerful collaboration solution that integrates with up to three flat-panel displays to bring more intelligence and versatility to your collaboration spaces. Ideal locations for this solution include large, custom video rooms, boardrooms, auditoriums, classroom theaters, conference rooms, purpose-built workspaces for vertical applications, and more. The integrator bundle combines the performance of the Webex Codec Pro collaboration engine, the flexibility of the Webex PTZ 4K pan-tilt-zoom camera and the purpose-built Webex Room Navigator table stand control panel to offer maximum flexibility and premium video collaboration in scenarios where you need special camera placement, want to view objects close up, or want to view a wide area with pan-tilt-zoom capability.

Product overview
The Room Kit Pro PTZ 4K integrator package delivers an industry-leading audio and video experience that customers have come to expect from Cisco. It acts as the audio and video engine for ultra HD video collaboration applications and AV integrations in which multiple screens, cameras, and content sources may be required. The Room Kit Pro PTZ 4K package continues the same artificial intelligence capabilities already offered on the rest of the Webex Room Series: intelligent views and framing, noise suppression, voice commands, and people count. In addition, the bundle provides flexibility for the largest meeting rooms and collaboration spaces that can benefit from a pan-tilt-zoom camera. The PTZ 4K Camera is an intelligent camera that delivers 20x optical, 12x digital zoom, and 4K ultra HD video.
It also offers AI-powered face and upper-body detection, automatic framing, and smart PresenterTrack capabilities while providing a high level of flexibility for custom and specialized integrations to enable natural interactions that remote participants can follow just like in-person attendees. Used within the Webex Room Kit Pro collaboration kit, the PTZ 4K Camera can take the meeting experience to a new level with powerful zoom, rapid and noiseless pan-tilt, and crystal-clear close-ups on distant objects and participants.
The Room Kit Pro PTZ 4K bundle is rich in functionality and experience, and is priced and designed to be easily scalable to all of your collaboration spaces—whether registered on the premises or to the Webex cloud service. Figure 2 shows the default components of the package.
