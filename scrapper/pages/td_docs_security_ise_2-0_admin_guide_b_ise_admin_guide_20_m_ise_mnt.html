Monitoring and Troubleshooting Service in Cisco ISE
The Monitoring and Troubleshooting (MnT) service is a comprehensive identity solution for all Cisco ISE run-time services and uses the following components:
Monitoring: Provides real-time presentation of meaningful data representing the state of access activities on a network. This insight allows you to easily interpret and affect operational conditions.
Troubleshooting: Provides contextual guidance for resolving access issues on networks. You can then address user concerns and provide resolution in a timely manner.
Reporting: Provides a catalog of standard reports that you can use to analyze trends and monitor system performance and network activities. You can customize reports in various ways and save them for future use. You can search records using wild cards and multiple values in all the reports for the Identity, Endpoint ID, and ISE Node (except the Health Summary report) fields.

Data Stored in the Monitoring Database
Cisco ISE Dashboard
The Cisco ISE dashboard or home page (Home > Summary) is the landing page that appears after you log in to the Cisco ISE administration console. The dashboard is a centralized management console consisting of metric meters along the top of the window, with dashlets below. The default dashboards are Summary, Endpoints, Guests, Vulnerability, and Threat.
The dashboard’s real-time data provides an at-a-glance status of the devices and users accessing your network as well as an overview of the system's health.

Note
You must have Adobe Flash Player installed to be able to view the dashlets and all the corresponding drill-down windows.

Note
You cannot rename or delete a default dashboard.
Detach: To view a dashlet in a separate window.
Refresh: To refresh a dashlet.
Remove: To remove a dashlet from the dashboard.
Network Privilege Framework
The dashboard shows the activity on the Network Privilege Framework (NPF), and provides detailed information on the various components.
The NPF is composed of the three tiers outlined in the following table:
Table 1. NPF Tiers
Tier
Specifications
1
Access control based on identity using 802.1x, MAC authentication bypass (MAB), the Cisco ISE Profiler service
2
Access control based on identity using 802.1x, MAB, Profiler, guest provisioning of the Network Admission Control (NAC) manager, central web authentication
3
Access control based on identity and posture using 802.1x, MAB, Profiler, guest provisioning of the NAC manager, central web authentication
NPF authentication and authorization generates a flow of events. The events from the different sources are then collected by Cisco ISE monitoring and troubleshooting tools and summarized. You can view the authentication and authorization results on the dashboard or choose to run any number of reports.

Network Privilege Framework Event Flow Process
The Network Privilege Framework (NPF) authentication and authorization event flow uses the process described in the following table:
Process Stage
Description
1
Network Access Device (NAD) performs either a normal authorization or a flex authorization.
2
An unknown agentless identity is profiled with web authorization.
3
A RADIUS server authenticates and authorizes the identity.
4
Authorization is provisioned for the identity at the port.
5
Unauthorized endpoint traffic is dropped.
User Roles and Permissions for Monitoring and Troubleshooting Capabilities
Monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities are associated with default user roles. The tasks you are allowed to perform are directly related to your assigned user role.
See Cisco ISE Administrator Groups for information on the permissions and restrictions set for each user role.

Note
Accessing Cisco ISE using the root shell without Cisco TAC supervision is not supported, and Cisco is not responsible for any service disruption that might be caused as a result.

Data Stored in the Monitoring Database
The Cisco ISE monitoring service collects and stores data in a specialized monitoring database. The rate and amount of data utilized to monitor network functions may require a node dedicated solely to monitoring. If your Cisco ISE network collects logging data at a high rate from policy service nodes or network devices, we recommend a Cisco ISE node dedicated to monitoring.
To manage the information stored in the monitoring database, perform full and incremental backups of the database. This includes purging unwanted data and then restoring the database.
Related Concepts
Monitoring Database
Device Configuration for Monitoring
The monitoring node receives and uses data from the devices on a network to populate the dashboard display. To enable communication between the monitoring node and the network devices, the switches and NADs must be configured properly.

Configure NADs for ISE Monitoring
Network Process Status
You can view process status for the network from the Cisco ISE dashboard using the System Summary dashlet. For example, when processes like the application server or database fail, an alarm is generated and you can view the results using the System Summary dashlet.
The color of the system status icon indicates the health of your system:
Green = Healthy
Yellow = Warning
Red = Critical
Gray = No information

Profiler Activity and Profiled Endpoints
The Profiled Endpoint dashlet focuses on the endpoints on the network that have matched profiles, providing profile data for each endpoint. For example, the statistics allow you to determine the type of device, its location, and its IP address. The sparklines along the top of the dashlet represent endpoint activity over the last 24 hours and last 60 minutes.
The Profiled Endpoint dashlet represents the total number of endpoints that have been profiled on the network for the last 24 hours, including those that are unknown. It is not a representation of how many endpoints are currently active on the network. Sparkline metrics at the top of the dashlet show time specific values for the last 24 hours and 60 minutes.

Troubleshooting the Profiler Feed
The Test Feed Service Connection button on Administration > Feed Service > Profiler verifies that there is a connection to the Cisco feed server, and that the certificate is valid.
If the test is able to connect to the Cisco feed server, a pop-up window is displayed with a message stating that the test connection is successful.
If the connection fails, the area adjacent to the Test Feed Service Connection button displays a response from the server, which is similar to the following example in which the important part of the message is in bold:
Test result: Failure: FeedService test connection failed : Feed Service unavailable : SocketTimeoutException invoking https://ise.cisco.com:8443/feedserver/feed/serverinfo: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException:PKIX path building failed: Sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException Unable to find valid certification path to requested target
Here are some possible error messages, and the corresponding actions to be taken:
Unable to find valid certification path to requested target: This message indicates that the certificate that the feed server used is not valid. Verify that you have enabled the Verisign certificates.
No route to host: Verify that you have a working connection to an outside network from the Cisco ISE server.
UnknownHostException (at the beginning of an error message): Verify that you have a working connection to an outside network from the Cisco ISE server.
Posture Compliance
The Posture Compliance dashlet provides information about the users who are accessing the network, and whether they are posture compliant. The data that is displayed is for devices that are currently connected to the network. The stack bars show noncompliance statistics, and are arranged according to the operating system and other criteria. Spark lines represent the percentage of compliant versus noncompliant posture attempts.

Cisco ISE Alarms
Alarms notify you of critical conditions on a network and are displayed in the Alarms dashlet. They also provide information on system activities, such as data purge events. You can configure how you want to be notified about system activities, or disable them entirely. You can also configure the threshold for certain alarms.
Most alarms do not have an associated schedule and are sent immediately after an event occurs. At any given point in time, only the latest 15,000 alarms are retained.
If the event re-occurs, then the same alarms are suppressed for a minimum duration of two hours. During the time that the event re-occurs, depending up on the trigger, it may take up to three hours for the alarms to re-appear.
The following table lists all the Cisco ISE alarms, descriptions and their resolution.

Alarm Syslog Collection Location
Alarm Syslog Collection Location
If you configure monitoring functions to send alarm notifications as syslog messages, you need a syslog target to receive the notification. Alarm syslog targets are the destinations where alarm syslog messages are sent.

Note
Cisco ISE monitoring requires that the logging-source interface configuration use the network access server (NAS) IP address. You must configure a switch for Cisco ISE monitoring.
You must also have a system that is configured as a syslog server to be able to receive syslog messages. You can create, edit, and delete alarm syslog targets.
To configure a remote logging target as an alarm target, perform this procedure.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Administration > System > Logging > Remote Logging Targets.
Step 2
Click Add.
Step 3
In the New Logging Target section displayed, submit the required details for the logging target, and check the Include Alarms for this Target check box.
Live Authentications
You can monitor recent RADIUS authentications as they happen from the Live Authentications window. The window displays the top 10 RADIUS authentications in the last 24 hours. This section explains the functions of the Live Authentications window.
The Live Authentications window shows the live authentication entries corresponding to the authentication events as they happen. In addition to authentication entries, this window also shows the live session entries corresponding to the events. You can also drill-down a session to view a detailed report corresponding to that session.
The Live Authentications window provides a tabular account of recent RADIUS authentications, in the order in which they occur. The last update shown at the bottom of the Live Authentications window shows the date of the server, time, and timezone.

Note
If the password attribute in an Access-Request packet is empty, an error message is triggered and the access request will fail.
When a single endpoint authenticates successfully, two entries appear in the Live Authentications window: one corresponding to the authentication record and another corresponding to the session record (pulled from the session live view). Subsequently, when the device performs another successful authentication, the repeat counter corresponding to the session record is incremented. The Repeat Counter that appears in the Live Authentications window shows the number of duplicate RADIUS authentication success messages that are suppressed.
See the Live Authentication data categories that are shown by default. These are described in the Recent RADIUS Authentications section.
You can choose to view all the columns, or only selected data columns. After selecting the columns that you want to be displayed, you can save your selections.

Filter Data in the Live Authentications Page
Using the filters in the Live Authentications page, you can filter the information that you need and troubleshoot network authentication issues quickly. You can filter records in the Authentication (live logs) page and view only those records that you are interested in. The authentication logs contain many details, and filtering the authentications from a particular user or location helps you scan the data quickly. You can use several operators that are available in the fields in the Live Authentications page to filter out records based on your search criteria.:
'abc' : Contains 'abc'
'!abc' : Does not contain 'abc'
'{}' : Is empty
'!{}' : Is not empty
'abc*' : Starts with 'abc'
'*abc' : Ends with 'abc'
'\!', '\*', '\{', '\\' : Escape
The Escape option allows you to filter text with special characters (including the special characters used as filters). You must prefix the special character with a backward slash (\). For example, if you want to view the authentication records of users with identity "Employee!," enter "Employee\!" in the Identity Filter field. In this example, Cisco ISE considers the exclamation mark (!) as a literal character and not as a special character.
In addition, the Status field allows you to filter only passed authentication records, failed authentications, live sessions, and so on. The green check mark filters all the passed authentications that occurred in the past. The red cross mark filters all failed authentications. The blue i icon filters all live sessions. You can also choose to view a combination of these options.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Operations > RADIUS > Live Logs.
Step 2
Filter data based on any of the fields in the Show Live Authentications page.
You can filter the results based on passed or failed authentications, or live sessions.
Global Search for Endpoints
You can use the global search box available at the top of the Cisco ISE home page to search for endpoints. You can use any of the following criteria to search for an endpoint:
User name
MAC Address
IP Address
Authorization Profile
Endpoint Profile
Failure Reason
Identity Group
Identity Store
Network Device name
Network Device Type
Operating System
Posture Status
Location
Security Group
User Type
You should enter at least three characters for any of the search criteria in the Search field to display data.

Note
If an endpoint has been authenticated by Cisco ISE, or its accounting update has been received, it can be found through the global search. Endpoints that have been manually added and are not authenticated by or accounted for in Cisco ISE will not show up in the search results.
The search result provides a detailed and at-a-glance information about the current status of the endpoint, which you can use for troubleshooting. Search results display only the top 25 entries. It is recommended to use filters to narrow down the results.
The following figure shows an example of the search result.
Figure 1. Search Result For Endpoints
You can use any of the properties in the left panel to filter the results. You can also click on any endpoint to see more detailed information about the endpoint, such as:

Technical Support Tunnel for Advanced Troubleshooting
Cisco ISE uses the Cisco IronPort Tunnel infrastructure to create a secure tunnel for Cisco technical support engineers to connect to an ISE server and troubleshoot issues with the system. Cisco ISE uses SSH to create the secure connection through the tunnel.
As an administrator, you can control the tunnel access; you can choose when and how long to grant access to a support engineer. Cisco Customer Support cannot establish the tunnel without your intervention. You will receive notifications about the service logins. You can disable the tunnel connection at any point of time. By default, the technical support tunnel remains open for 72 hours. However, we recommend that you or the support engineer close the tunnel when all the troubleshooting work is complete. You can choose to extend the tunnel beyond 72 hours, if needed.
Use tech support-tunnel enable command to initiate a tunnel connection.
The tech support-tunnel status command displays the status of the connection. This command provides information on whether the connection is established or not, if there is an authentication failure, or if the servers are unreachable. If the tunnel server is reachable, but ISE is unable to authenticate, ISE tries to authenticate again every 5 minutes for a period of 30 minutes, after which the tunnel is disabled.
You can disable the tunnel connection using the tech support-tunnel disable command. This command disconnects an existing tunnel even if a support engineer is currently logged in.
If you have already established a tunnel connection from an ISE server, the SSH keys that are generated are available on the ISE server. When you try to enable the support tunnel at a later point of time, the system prompts you about reusing the SSH keys generated earlier. You can choose to use the same keys or generate new keys. You can also manually reset the keys using the tech support-tunnel resetkey command. If you execute this command when a tunnel connection is enabled, the system prompts you to disable the connection first. If you choose to continue with the existing connection and not disable t,he connection the keys are reset after the existing connection is disabled. If you choose to disable the connection, the tunnel connection is dropped and the keys are reset immediately.
After you establish a tunnel connection, you can extend it using the tech support-tunnel extend command.
See the Cisco Identity Services Engine CLI Reference Guide for usage guidelines about the tech support-tunnel command.
Establish a Technical Support Tunnel
Establish a Technical Support Tunnel
You can establish a secure tunnel through the Cisco ISE Command Line Interface (CLI).
Procedure
Step 1
Enter the following command from the Cisco ISE CLI:
tech support-tunnel enable
The system prompts you for a password and a nickname for the tunnel.
Step 2
Enter the password.
Step 3
(Optional) Enter a nickname for the tunnel.
The system generates an SSH key and displays the password, device serial number, and the SSH key. You must pass this information to Cisco Customer Support for the support engineer to connect to your system.
Step 4
Copy the password, device serial number, and SSH key and send it to Cisco Customer Support.
The support engineer can now securely connect to your ISE server. You will receive periodic notifications about service logins.
TCP Dump Utility to Validate the Incoming Traffic
TCP Dump Utility sniffs packets, which you can use to verify that the expected packet has reached a node. For example, when there is no incoming authentication or log indicated in the report, you may suspect that there is no incoming traffic, or that the incoming traffic cannot reach Cisco ISE. In such cases, you can run this tool to validate.
You can configure the TCP Dump options and then collect data from the network traffic to help you troubleshoot a network issue.

Caution
Starting a TCP Dump automatically deletes a previous dump file. To save a previous dump file, perform the task, as described in the Saving a TCP Dump File section before you begin a new TCP Dump session.

Monitoring Database
The rate and amount of data that is utilized by Monitoring functions requires a separate database on a dedicated node that is used for these purposes.
Like Policy Service, Monitoring has a dedicated database that requires you to perform maintenance tasks, such as the topics covered in this section:
Back Up and Restore of the Monitoring Database
Monitoring Database Purge

Back Up and Restore of the Monitoring Database
Monitoring database handles large volumes of data. Over time, the performance and efficiency of the monitoring node depends on how well you manage that data. To increase efficiency, we recommend that you back up the data and transfer it to a remote repository on a regular basis. You can automate this task by scheduling automatic backups.

Note
You should not perform a backup when a purge operation is in progress. If you start a backup during a purge operation, the purge operation stops or fails.
If you register a secondary Monitoring node, we recommend that you first back up the primary Monitoring node and then restore the data to the new secondary Monitoring node. This ensures that the history of the primary Monitoring node is in sync with the new secondary node as new changes are replicated.

Guidelines for Data Restoration
Monitoring Database Purge
The purging process allows you to manage the size of the Monitoring database by specifying the number of months to retain data during a purge. The default is three months. This value is utilized when the disk space usage threshold for purging (percentage of disk space) is met. For this option, each month consists of 30 days. A default of three months equals 90 days.

Guidelines for Purging the Monitoring Database
Guidelines for Purging the Monitoring Database
The following are some guidelines to follow relating to Monitoring database disk usage:
If the Monitoring database disk usage is greater than 80 percent of the threshold setting, critical alarm is generated indicating that the database size has exceeded the allocated disk size. If the disk usage is greater than 90 percent another alarm is generated.
A purge process runs, creating a status history report that you can view in the Data Purging Audit window. The navigation path to this window is Operations > Reports > Deployment Status > Data Purging Audit. An information (INFO) alarm is generated when the purge completes.
Purging is also based on the percentage of consumed disk space for the database. When the consumed disk space for the Monitoring database is equal to or exceeds the threshold (the default is 80 percent), the purge process starts. This process deletes only the last seven days of monitoring data, irrespective of what is configured in the Admin portal. It will continue this process in a loop until the disk space is below 80 percent. Purging always checks the Monitoring database disk space limit before proceeding.
Purge Older Monitoring Data
Before you begin
To perform the following task, you must be a Super Admin or System Admin.
Procedure
Step 1
Choose Administration > System > Maintenance > Data Purging.
Step 2
Specify the time period in months, for which the data will be retained. All the data prior to the specified time period will be purged. For this option, each month consists of 30 days. The default of three months equals 90 days.
Note 
If the configured retention period is less than the existing retention thresholds corresponding to the diagnostics data, then the configured value overrides the existing threshold values. For example, if you configure the retention period as 3 days and this value is less than the existing thresholds in the diagnostics tables (for example, a default of 5 days), then data is purged according to the value that you configure (3 days) in this page.
Step 3
Click Submit.
Step 4
Verify the success of the data purge by viewing the Data Purging Audit report.

Database Crash or File Corruption Issues
Cisco ISE may crash if the oracle database files are corrupted due to power outage or other reasons resulting in data loss. Based on the incident, follow the steps below to recover from data loss.
In case of PAN corruption in deployment, you should promote the Secondary PAN to Primary PAN.
If SPAN is promotion is not possible due to small deployment or any other reason, restore the most recent available backup.
In case of PSN corruption, follow the steps to de-register, reset config and register the node again.
In case of Standalone box, restore most recent available backup.

Note
Obtain backup from the standalone box regularaly to avoid loss in the latest configuration changes.
