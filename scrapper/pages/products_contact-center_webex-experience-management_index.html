Super Cool Meeting and Online Webinar Tool
The features of Cisco Webex made our online meetings easy and effective, especially when it comes to the live chat option with a panel and live poll of opinions regarding the meet is something I'm liking most. Since I'm into Ed-tech Cisco Webex is used to connect with my learners and our learning platform is also embedded with Cisco Webex. Our learners are also happy to use Cisco Webex as their learning platform.

Know how to know your customer
The business problem it solves is actionable intelligence based on customer feedback across every touchpoint in the journey which otherwise a yearly NPS doesn't quiet tell the whole story.
