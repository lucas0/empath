Overview of the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal
The Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal is a cloud-infrastructure automation tool tailored for Cisco SD-WAN, which provides a quick way to provision, monitor, and maintain Cisco SD-WAN controllers on public cloud providers.
You can provision the following controllers using the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal:
Cisco vManage
Cisco vBond Orchestrator
Cisco vSmart Controller
Figure 1. Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal Benefits and Operations
The Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal can be configured to use an identity provider (IdP) to enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the portal access. You can configure the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal to use an IdP that lets you connect any user with any application on any device, using single sign-on (SSO). The Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal is modularized into separate web servers, backend servers, and database clusters to achieve software scalability.
Cisco vMonitor monitors the cloud infrastructure and updates health notifications regarding a customer’s overlay infrastructure to a common database. The Cisco vOrchestrator web server is also accessible for advanced features and any existing infrastructure-tier customizations, if any, that you use. The Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal uses Cisco vMonitor and Cisco vOrchestrator by way of API calls to orchestrate actions and monitor the overlay.

Note
Cisco vOrchestrator and Cisco vMonitor can only be accessed by Cisco FedOps.
A common global database with multiple read replicas for high availability and disaster recovery is used by all the three applications, and the applications connect to the database using a Transport Layer Security (TLS) or a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) connection.
Figure 2. Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal Architecture
There are two types of users for Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal for government:
Customers, such as service providers, partners, and other end users.
Cisco Federal Operations (FedOps): A Cisco team that maintains and monitors Cisco SD-WAN for government.

Note
Cisco FedOps cannot access the customers' Amazon VPCs.
Prerequisites for the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal
Purchase a Cisco DNA subscription on the Cisco Commerce Workspace.
Create or use an existing Smart Account.
Create a Virtual Account associated with your Smart Account.
Add the device serial numbers on the Cisco Plug and Play (PnP) Connect portal.
For more information, see Cisco Network Plug and Play Connect Capability Overview.
Benefits of the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal

Smart Account and Virtual Accounts
A Smart Account contains the licenses purchased by your organization. A Smart Account is a central repository where you can view purchased software assets, register, and report software use, and manage licenses across the entire organization.
For the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal, Cisco has granted the right to access the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal to the Smart Account administrator. A Smart Account administrator can now view and perform operational tasks related to a customer's hosted controller infrastructure, such as viewing the controllers’ IP addresses and modifying the controllers' IP access lists. If you do not wish for certain users to receive such access, go to the Manage Smart Account section of Cisco Software Central, and remove those users as Smart Account administrators, or use the IDP (identity provider) onboarding feature to grant access to the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal based on the trusted users in the IDP.
For more information, see Access the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal.
Virtual Accounts are subaccounts within your Smart Account. Virtual Accounts help you organize your Cisco assets in a way that is logical for your business. You can set up Virtual Accounts by department, product, geography, or other designation that best fits your company's business model.
A default Virtual Account is created for you. We recommend that you create a dedicated Virtual Account for creating Cisco SD-WAN overlays.
For more information, see Access the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal.
To provision a Cisco SD-WAN controller, a Virtual Account should be associated with an offer attribute that is SD-WAN capable. An SD-WAN-capable attribute is associated with a Virtual Account when ordering your Cisco DNA cloud license.

Note
When you order Cisco DNA licenses using the enterprise agreement, automatic association of Virtual Accounts to an SD-WAN-capable attribute is not available. You need to submit a cloud-controller provisioning request form through the Enterprise Agreement Workspace for the Cisco CloudOps team to provision the controllers. Contact Cisco SD-WAN Technical Support to request that the desired Virtual Account become available on the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal. After the desired Virtual Account is available on the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal, you can provision the controllers after providing the necessary enterprise agreement contract information.

Workflow for Smart Account and Virtual Accounts for Provisioning the Controllers
The following is the workflow for creating a Smart Account, a Virtual Account, and associating the Cisco DNA subscription with your Virtual Account.
Create a Smart Account for your organization on Cisco Software Central.
Create a Virtual Account associated with your Smart Account.
For information on how to create a Virtual Account, see Access the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal.
Purchase a Cisco DNA subscription on the Cisco Commerce Workspace.

Note
A Cisco DNA subscription should be associated with one of the Virtual Accounts under the respective Smart Account.
Typically, an account manager or a Cisco sales representative places the order on the behalf of the customer.
Choose the DNA cloud subscription product identification (PID) as the license.
The selection of the DNA cloud subscription PID triggers the automatic association of the Virtual Account with the SD-WAN-capable attribute for provisioning of the controllers.
When the order is complete, the Virtual Account is available on the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal for controller provisioning.

Note
The Virtual Account should contain the device serial numbers that were added on the Cisco Plug and Play (PnP) portal. Once the overlay is created through the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal, see the Controller Profile tab on the Cisco PnP portal to view the mapping of the device serial numbers with their respective controllers. The mapping of device serial numbers to the controllers provides the necessary information for adding the devices to Cisco vManage or performing zero-touch provisioning (ZTP). View the Controller Profile tab in the Cisco PnP portal to confirm that the controllers were provisioned as part of the Cisco SD-WAN overlay creation process using the Cisco SD-WAN Self-Service Portal.
