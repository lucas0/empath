Let your voice be heard
These routers allow us to connect directly to telco PRIs so that our branch offices have phone services. We also use them as our backup WAN router if the primary WAN router would ever happen to go down.

Best SD-WAN branch Routers
They are very fast, reliable, and easy to deploy and manage. Cisco ISR 4000 series routers can be used for large enterprise networks. Can be managed through an integrated management controller.

Cisco 4000 Is the Gold Standard for Small/medium Office Telephony Needs
I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a voice gateway device for a small to medium office environment that included 100 to 500 people. This is where we have these devices deployed and they work very well for that purpose. They provide SRST for Cisco Phones and are robust enough to handle core routing and DHCP services if needed. Because they are able to accept many different modules, the flexibility at the telephone edge makes them ideal for consistency in base hardware. They are easy to configure and licensing is less problematic than other Cisco devices.
