Command Modes
Interface Configuration (config-if)
Command History
Release Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco SD-WAN Manager CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
When you enable Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) or Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP), the local router requires the remote device to prove its identity before allowing data traffic to flow. PAP authentication requires the remote device to send a name and a password, which is checked against a matching entry in the local username database or in the remote security server database. CHAP authentication sends a challenge message to the remote device. The remote device encrypts the challenge value with a shared secret and returns the encrypted value and its name to the local router in a Response message. The local router attempts to match the name of the remote device with an associated secret stored in the local username or remote security server database; it uses the stored secret to encrypt the original challenge and verify that the encrypted values match.
In order to configure PPP Authentication, you must configure the encapsulation of the interface as PPP.
Example
The following example shows how to configure CHAP authentication on interface Dialer1.
Device# config-transaction
Device(config)# interface Dialer1
Device(config-if)# encapsulation ppp
Device(config-if)# ppp authentication chap
Related Commands
Command
Description
encapsulation ppp
Configures the PPP as the encapsulation protocol for an interface.
ppp chap hostname
To create a pool of dialup routers by specifying a common alias for all routers when authenticating with CHAP (Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol), use the ppp chaphostname command in interface configuration mode. To disable this function, use the no form of the command.
ppp chap hostname hostname
no ppp chap hostname
Syntax Description
hostname
The name sent in the CHAP challenge.
Command Default
Disabled. The router name is sent in any CHAP challenges.
Command Modes
Interface configuration (config-if)
Command History
Release
Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco vManage CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
The command is available only when encapsulation ppp is configured.
The ppp chap hostname command allows you to specify a common alias for all routers in a rotary group to use so that only one username must be configured on the dialing routers.
This command is normally used with local CHAP authentication (when the router authenticates to the peer), but it can also be used for remote CHAP authentication.

Note
By default, after changing hostnames, an MLP member link does not undergo failure recovery automatically. You must use the ppp chap hostname command to define the Multilink PPP (MLP) bundle name on an endpoint. If this command is not configured and the hostname is changed, then a link flap will not return the link back to the bundle.
Device(config)# interface Dialer 1
Device(config-if)# encapsulation ppp
Device(config-if)# ppp chap hostname ntt
ppp chap password
To configure a common CHAP secret to be used in responses to challenges from an unknown remote peer in a collection of routers that do not support this command (such as routers running older Cisco IOS software images), use the ppp chap password interface configuration command. To disable this function, use the no form of this command.
ppp chap password secret
no ppp chap password secret
Syntax Description
secret
The secret used to compute the response value for any CHAP challenge from an unknown peer.
Command Default
Disabled
Command Modes

Interface configuration (config-if)
Command History

Usage Guidelines
The command is available only when encapsulation ppp is configured.
This command allows you to replace several username and password configuration commands with a single copy of this command on any dialer interface or asynchronous group interface.
This command is used for remote CHAP authentication only (when routers authenticate to the peer) and does not affect local CHAP authentication.
Device(config)# interface Dialer 1
Device(config-if)# encapsulation ppp
Device(config-if)# ppp chap password ntt
ppp pap sent-username password
To enable remote Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) support for an interface, and to use the values specified for username and password in the PAP authentication request, use the ppp pap sent-username password command in interface configuration mode. To disable remote PAP support, use the no form of this command.
ppp pap sent-username username password password
no ppp pap sent-username username
Syntax Description
username
Username sent in the PAP authentication request.
password
Cleartext or already-encrypted password.
Command Default
Remote PAP support is disabled.
Command Modes

Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.1a
Command qualified for use in Cisco vManage CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines

You must configure the ppp pap sent-username password command for each interface.
The command is available only when virtual-ppp is configured.
In the following example, a password is entered as a cleartext password, xxxx for remote PAP authentication:
router# configure
router(config)# interface POS 0/1/0/0
router(config-if)# ppp pap sent-username xxxx password notified
router(config-if)# ppp pap sent-username xxxx password clear notified
