    Product overview
The Cisco® NCS 1000 Mux/Demux 64-Channel Patch Panel is a standalone passive unit that contains both a 64-channel optical multiplexer and a 64-channel optical demultiplexer, precabled within the unit’s housing.
This unit provides support for 400ZR and NCS1004 multihaul coherent channels up to 63 Gbaud at 75-GHz spacing. This filter is designed with optimum tradeoff between bandwidth and isolation for a network designed with 64 channels of 400ZR.
Figure 1.

The panel’s ports are arranged in 18 columns and 5 rows. The placement of the clips provides optimal fiber routing, facilitating the addition of fibers in an incremental manner and resulting in a simple design that is easy to maintain and troubleshoot. A separate tie wrap is provided for fastening the USB cable used for passive inventory management and storage of insertion loss values. The panel shall fit into ETSI 300-mm and ANSI 450-mm racks.
