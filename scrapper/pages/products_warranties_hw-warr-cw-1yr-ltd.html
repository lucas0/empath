The date of shipment of a Product by Cisco is set forth on the packaging material in which the Product is shipped.
This limited warranty extends only to the original user of the Product. Customer's sole and exclusive remedy and the entire liability of Cisco and its suppliers under this limited warranty will be, at Cisco's or its service center's option, shipment of a replacement within the warranty period and according to the replacement process described in the warranty card (or if no warranty card, as described on the Cisco Product Warranties web page https://www.cisco.com/go/warranty) or a refund of the purchase price if the Hardware is returned to the party supplying it to Customer, freight and insurance prepaid.
Cisco replacement parts used in Hardware replacement may be new or equivalent to new.

How to Return Parts
Return Material Authorizations
To Receive a Return Materials Authorization (RMA) Number:
●    Please contact the party from whom you purchased the product.
●    If you purchased the product directly from Cisco, call Cisco TAC by phone to start a validation of your warranty claim.
To obtain a directory of toll-free Cisco TAC telephone numbers for your country, go to this URL: https://www.cisco.com/go/DirTAC.
Cisco’s Technical Assistance Center (TAC) will perform limited troubleshooting to isolate the hardware problem and determine cause of failure. If you are instructed to return your product under the terms of your warranty and issued an RMA Number, follow these steps:
●    Return the unit to Cisco or your network supplier in accordance the Cisco RMA Policy for Warranty and Hardware Support Contract Returns. Your unit will be replaced per the applicable warranty guidelines.
●    If you cannot locate your network supplier, you may return the unit to Cisco.
All material returned to Cisco must be accompanied by a Return Material Authorization (RMA) number issued by Cisco to ensure tracking and handling of returned material. The Cisco Returns Portal provides instructions on obtaining an RMA number and returning items to Cisco.
If the RMA number does not match the serial number of failed return product, Cisco reserves the right to refuse receipt of the returned unit(s).
Please note that destination country importation, compliance with US export controls and customs processes may condition actual delivery times. Advance replacements to and from the European Union will be shipped Delivered Duty Paid (DDP) (Incoterms 2020). All advance replacements will be shipped Delivered At Place (DAP) (Incoterms 2020), exclusive of any import duties, taxes and fees, where applicable. All advance replacements will be shipped using Cisco's preferred carrier, freight prepaid by Cisco. Requests for alternate carriers will be at Customer’s expense.
After exchange, the original (failed) part is Cisco property. You must return the original failed part within ten (10) calendar days in accordance with the Cisco RMA Policy for Warranty and Hardware Support Contract Returns.
