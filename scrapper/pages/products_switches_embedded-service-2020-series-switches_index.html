New Embedded Switch Withstands Harsh Environments
Extend switching capabilities to your mobile networks and other embedded networks that operate in extreme environments. Cisco Embedded Service 2020 Series Switches (ESS 2020 Series) provide highly secure data, voice, and video capabilities to stationary and mobile network nodes, making them ideal for Internet of Things applications.
Features and Capabilities
Size, weight, and power challenges are inherent in mobile environments. The ESS 2020 Series overcomes these issues with a flexible and compact form factor and low power consumption. Cisco partners and integrators can fully customize the ruggedized enclosures required for end customers.
The Cisco ESS 2020 Series is powered by Cisco IOS Software. The switches are available in a base card-only configuration (8 Fast Ethernet and 2 Gigabit Ethernet ports) or with an optional expansion card capable of providing 16 additional Fast Ethernet ports. The board size conforms to the widely accepted PC104 form factor (approximately 4 inches by 4 inches).
Usage Scenarios
The Cisco ESS 2020 Series offers the following advantages:
Customized enclosures provided by third parties
High port density in a small form factor
Portability
Low power consumption
Ability to operate in harsh environments
Oil & Gas
Oil and gas companies need to monitor and analyze data from some of the most remote, harshest environments in the world. Real-time data makes a big difference in terms of operational efficiency and decision making.
The ESS 2020 Series can collect data from remote oil rigs for real-time analysis by geologists located at corporate headquarters. Or it can help monitor the transit of gear to remote drilling or exploration sites.
Defense and Aerospace
Military vehicles and aircraft frequently operate in remote areas. The ESS 2020 Series can easily be part of communication within vehicles, among vehicles, or even extended communication to aircraft and drones flying overhead.
Transportation
The ESS 2020 Series can be installed in freight trains, tractor trailers, and first responder (police, fire fighters) or other vehicles to enable connectivity among many Ethernet devices including voice, video, and data equipment. Connected sensors can monitor condition of the vehicles, cargo, or crew, and convey this information to remote data centers or to other vehicles.
Mining
Mining companies continually seek to reduce the chance of accidents and maintain uptime in their operations, often subjected to high vibrations and extreme temperature.
An ESS 2020 Series Switch in a mining truck can ensure proactive maintenance and allow video monitoring and voice communication, while one located deep in a mineshaft can help maintain the safety of miners and provide communication to the surface.
Commercial Building Automation
Locating the ESS 2020 Series in building control panels or elevators allows connectivity of devices which monitor and control the environment. It also allows video and voice communication, and provides control for lighting, advertising panels, and other functions.
