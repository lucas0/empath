lte gps (cellular)
To configure Global Positioning System (GPS) parameters for a cellular router, use the lte gps command in cellular configuration mode. To delete the GPS configuration parameters, use the no form of this command.
lte gps { mode { ms-based | standalone } [ enable ] [ nmea [ ip udp ipv4-address ] ] | enable [ mode { ms-based | standalone } ] [ nmea [ ip udp ipv4-address ] ] | nmea [ ip udp source-ip-address destination-ip-address port ] }
no lte gps
Syntax Description
lte gps
Enables GPS on the LTE PIM module in the 0/x/0 section of the controller cellular configuration.
mode
Specifies the mode.
ms-based : Use mobile station-based assistance, also called assisted GPS mode, when determining position. In this mode, a network data session is used to obtain the GPS satellite locations, resulting in a faster fix of location coordinates.
standalone : Use satellite information when determining position.
Note
  The standalone parameter is currently not supported for geofencing.
ms-based
Enables ms-based assistance.
Note
  We recommend using ms-based mode with a SIM card plugged in and a GPS antenna connected to the LTE pluggable module GPS port.
For more information, see Cisco 4G Indoor/Outdoor Active GPS Antenna (GPS-ACT-ANTM-SMA).
standalone
Enables standalone mode.
If there is no SIM card inserted, you can use standalone mode.
Note
  The standalone parameter is currently not supported for geofencing.
enable
Enables the GPS features. Use this command to enable the GPS feature if GPS has been disabled for any reason.
nmea
Enables the use of National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) streams to Cisco IOS applications for listening to the specified port on the destination address.
ip
(Optional) Enables the redirection of GPS NMEA streams to the destination IP address.
Note
  This parameter is not used for configuring geofencing.
udp source-ip-address destination-ip-address port
(Optional) Enables the redirection of GPS NMEA streams to the source and destination IP address and port.
Note
  This parameter is not used for configuring geofencing.
Command Modes
controller Cellular 0/x/0 (config-Cellular-0/x/0)
Command History
Release
Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a
Command qualified for use in Cisco SD-WAN Manager CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
If multiple LTE pluggable module slots are present in the platform chassis, we recommend that you configure GPS on only one of the LTE pluggable module slots and use the slot for GPS coverage.
The following example enables GPS on the LTE PIM module:
Device(config)# controller Cellular 0/2/0
Device(config-Cellular-0/2/0)# lte gps enable
The following example sets ms-based assistance on the LTE PIM module:
Device(config-Cellular-0/2/0)# lte gps mode ms-based
The following example configures nmea on the LTE PIM module:
Device(config-Cellular-0/2/0)# lte gps nmea
profile id
To create a data profile for a device, use the profile id command in cellular configuration mode. To set the command to the default state, use the no form of this command.
profile id id apn name [ authentication auth_type username username password password ] [ pdn-type pdn_type ] [ slot slot_number ]
no profile id id
Syntax Description
id
Identification number of the data profile. Valid values are from 1 to 16.
apn name
Name of the access point network of the service provider.
authentication auth_type
Authentication type used for APN access. Valid values are:
chap : Use CHAP authentication only.
pap : Use PAP authentication only.
pap_chap : Use PAP or CHAP authentication.
username username
Username provided by the service provider for APN access authentication. Required if the authentication type is chap , pap , or pap_chap , otherwise not used.
password password
Password provided by the service provider for APN access authentication. Required if the authentication type is chap , pap , or pap_chap , otherwise not used.
pdn-type pdn_type
Type of packet data matching used for APN access. Valid values are:
ipv4 : IPv4 type bearer.
ipv4v6 : IPV4V6 type bearer.
ipv6 : IPv6 type bearer.
slot-number slot_number
SIM slot that contains the SIM to configure. Valid values are 0 (primary SIM card) and 1 (secondary SIM card).
Command Default
By default, when the Auto SIM feature is enabled on a modem, a data profile is selected based on the modem firmware.
Command Modes
Controller cellular configuration (controller-cellular)
Command History
Release Modification
Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.8.1
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
If a device contains two SIM cards, you can create a separate data profile for each SIM card.
The following example shows how to configure a data profile for the primary SIM card in a device:
controller Cellular 0/1/0
 profile id 6 apn test authentication chap username admin password my_password pdn-type ipv4 slot 0
