Support for SGT Propagation with Cisco TrustSec Integration
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1
This feature enables Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN edge devices to propagate Security Group Tag (SGT) inline tags that are generated by Cisco TrustSec-enabled switches in the branches to other edge devices in the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN network. While Cisco TrustSec-enabled switches does classification, propagation (inline SGT tagging) and enforcement on the branches, Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices carry the inline tags across the edge devices.

Support for SGT Propagation with Cisco TrustSec Integration
Cisco TrustSec is an end-to-end network infrastructure that provides a scalable architecture for the enforcement of role-based access control, identity-aware networking, and data confidentiality to secure the network and its resources. Cisco TrustSec uses Security Group Tag (SGT) to represent user and device groups. The switches, routers, and firewalls inspect these tags and enforce SGT-based traffic policies.
Cisco TrustSec is defined in three phases—classification, propagation, and enforcement. After traffic is classified, the SGT is propagated from where classification took place, to where enforcement action is invoked. This process is called propagation. Cisco TrustSec offers two types of SGT propagation, Inline tagging and Security Group Tag Exchange Protocol (SXP).
With inline tagging, a special Ethernet frame is used to propagate these SGTs between network hops where the policies are enforced based on the SGT policy. After the introduction of this feature, Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices support propagation of SGT. See Configure SGT Inline Tagging Using Cisco vManage
When Inline tagging is not used (or not possible), an SXP protocol can be used to dynamically exchange IP address binding to SGT between Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. You can also manually configure IP address to SGT binding, statically, in Cisco vManage. See SGT Propagation Using SXP
Enforcement of SGT is achieved using Security Group Access Control Lists (SGACL) where policies can be dynamically or statically configured and applied to the egress traffic on the network. See SGT Enforcement
Benefits of Cisco TrustSec
Provides secure access to network services and applications based on user and device identity.
Applies policies across the network using tags instead of IP addresses.
Enforces policies easily. SGT propagation simplifies network access and security operations with software-defined segmentation.
Scales fast and enforces policies consistently across the network. SGT propagation helps streamline security policy management across domains.
Reduces risk and segments devices without redesigning the network. You can easily manage access to enterprise resources and restrict lateral movement of threats with microsegmentation.
SGT Propagation Using Inline Tagging
One of the SGT propagation methods is using Inline tagging where a special Ethernet frame is used to propagate these SGTs between network hops where the policies are enforced based on the SGT policy. For more information see, SGT Propagation in Cisco SD-WAN
Prerequisites
Branches must be equipped with Cisco TrustSec-enabled switches that are capable of handling SGT inline tagging.

SGT Propagation in Cisco SD-WAN
The following image illustrates how SGT is propagated in Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN from one branch to another.
Figure 1. SGT Propagation in Cisco SD-WAN
In this illustration, Branch 1 and Branch 2 are equipped with Cisco TrustSec-enabled switches, and these branches are connected to the Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices. The Cisco TrustSec switch in Branch 1 performs SGT Inline tagging in the Ethernet CMD frame toward Edge Router 1. Edge Router 1 then de-encapsulates the CMD frame, extracts the SGT, and propagates it over Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN IPSec or GRE tunnels. The Edge Router 2 on Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN extracts the SGT from Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN, generates the Ethernet CMD frame, and copies the that is SGT received. The Cisco TrustSec switch on Branch 2 inspects the SGT, and looks it up against the destination SGT to determine if the traffic must be allowed or denied.
The following image is an illustration of SGT being carried through in an SD-WAN packet and an additional eight bytes of data is added to it.
Figure 2. SGT Propagation
The following table describes how SGT propagation between edge devices in the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN network varies based on the type of edge device and software release installed on the device.

Release Information
Description
SGT Propagation Using SXP and SGACL Enforcement
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.5.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.5.1
With this feature, Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices can exchange SGT over the overlay network using SXP. Use SXP when your hardware does not support Inline propagation of SGTs.
This feature also extends support for SGACL enforcement on Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices by configuring SGACL policies.
You can use SXP to propagate SGTs across network devices if your hardware does not support inline tagging. Using Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE), you can create an IP-to-SGT binding (Dynamic IP-SGT) and then download IP-SGT binding using SXP to a Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device for propagation of the SGT over the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN network. See Configure SXP for Dynamic IP-SGT Binding Using Cisco SD-WAN Manager.
Alternatively, you have the option to manually configure IP-SGT binding (Static IP-SGT) and then push the configuration to a Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device using a CLI Add-On template to propagate SGT over the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN network. See Configure Static IP-SGT Binding Using Cisco SD-WAN Manager.
Prerequisites
You must enable Cisco TrustSec and propagation through SXP on the devices in a Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN network.
Cisco ISE version must be 2.6 or later.
Points to Consider
Cisco ISE has a limit on the number of SXP sessions it can handle. Therefore, as an alternative, you can use SXP reflector for horizontal scaling.
Static IP-SGT configuration is based on the CLI Add-On template and not using a Feature template in vManage.
From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.5.1a, Cisco vManage Release 20.5.1, we recommend that you use an SXP reflector to establish an SXP peering with Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices. This is because when you use an SXP Reflector, the SXP filtering option ensures that only relevant IP-SGT bindings for the local service side networks are pushed down to the Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device. Overlapping or remote entries coming though SXP can have an adverse effect on the Overlay routing. See SXP Reflectors
Limitations for SGT Propagation Using SXP
802.1x-based SGT assignment is not supported.
SGACL policies cannot be downloaded using HTTP.
SXP filter is not supported.
Static SGACLs using IPv6 is not supported through CLI or Cisco SD-WAN Manager.
SGACL policies cannot be enforced on the ingress traffic, only on egress traffic in a Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN network.
The option to cache SGT is not available.
An SXP connection with an IPv6 version is not supported.
You cannot have overlapping of OMP routes for the prefixes bound to SGTs.
SXP Node ID must be explicitly configured.
Cisco TrustSec feature is not supported with Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) mode enabled. If FIPS mode is enabled, download of Protected Access Credential (PAC) key fails.
Cisco TrustSec feature is not supported for more than 24K SGT Policies in controller mode.

Propagate SGT Using SXP
If hardware does not support SGT propagation through inline tagging, you can propagate SGT using SXP.
If a branch is equipped with Cisco TrustSec-enabled hardware, the branch is referred to as a TrustSec branch. You can propagate SGTs to a TrustSec branch through inline tagging. For information about Inline Tagging, see SGT Propagation in Cisco SD-WAN.
If a branch is not equipped with Cisco TrustSec-enabled hardware, the branch is referred to as a non-TrustSec branch. You can propagate SGT to a non-TrustSec branch using SXP.
In the case of a non-TrustSec branch, for SD-WAN ingress, a Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device performs SGT tagging based on source IP address of the packet and IP-SGT binding dynamically learned from ISE using SXP or based on static IP-SGT binding configuration. For SD-WAN egress, the Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device performs a destination SGT lookup based on the destination IP address using IP-SGT bindings (received through SXP or static configuration), and the SGT is determined. Policies for the SGT traffic on SD-WAN egress is enforced either by downloading SGACL policies from ISE or by configuring static SGACL policies.
SXP Reflectors
SXP Reflectors
SXP reflectors are used when you need to have multiple connections to communicate information about IP-SGT bindings over a network. Because Cisco ISE has a limit on the number of SXP sessions it can handle, as an alternative, you can use Cisco ASR1000 routers, with the SXP reflector functionality enabled for horizontal scaling between ISE and the Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device.
You can configure an SXP connection to an SXP reflector the same way you configure an SXP connection to ISE. For information about configuring SXP reflector, see Configure SXP Reflector using the CLI.
We recommend an SXP reflector to establish SXP peering with Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices. When you use an SXP reflector, the SXP filtering configuration ensures that only relevant IP-SGT bindings for the local service-side networks are pushed down to the Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices. Overlapping or remote entries coming through an SXP can have an adverse effect on overlay routing.
Configure SXP for Dynamic IP-SGT Binding Using Cisco SD-WAN Manager

SGACL for Cisco TrustSec
Security Group Access Control Lists (SGACLs) are a policy enforcement mechanism through which an administrator can control the operations performed by users based on the security group assignments and destination resources.
SGACL policies are configured in Cisco ISE and dynamically downloaded for enforcement to a Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device using a RADIUS server. The downloaded SGACL policies override any conflicting locally defined policies. See Download SGACL Policies to Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices.
Alternatively, you have the option of configuring SGACL policies on Cisco vManage. The policies can be pushed to the Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device using the CLI Add-On template. See Configure Static SGACL Policies in Cisco SD-WAN Manager.
