Introduction
This document discusses the setup of an EtherChannel between a Cisco Catalyst 5500 switch and a Catalyst 6500 switch, both running Catalyst OS (CatOS). Any Catalyst 4500/4000, 5500/5000, or 6500/6000 series switch running CatOS could have been used in this scenario to obtain the same results. EtherChannel can be called Fast EtherChannel (FEC) or Gigabit EtherChannel (GEC), depending on the speed of the interfaces or ports used to form the EtherChannel.
In this example, two Fast Ethernet (FE) ports from each of the switches have been bundled into an FEC. Throughout this document, the terms "Fast EtherChannel", "Gigabit EtherChannel", "port channel", "channel", and "port group" all refer to EtherChannel.
This document includes only the configuration files from the switches and the output from the related sample show commands. For further details on how to configure an EtherChannel between Catalyst switches, refer to the following document:
Configuring EtherChannel Between Catalyst 4000, 5000, and 6000 Switches Running CatOS
This document does not provide configurations using the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP).  For more information on configuring LACP, refer to the following document:
Configuring LACP (802.3ad) Between a Catalyst 6000 and a Catalyst 4000
Prerequisites
Requirements
There are no specific requirements for this document.
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
Catalyst 5500 switch running CatOS 6.3(7) software
Catalyst 6500 switch running CatOS 7.2(2) software
Note: Before configuring the channel between the CatOS switches, refer to the following document:
System Requirements to Implement EtherChannel on Catalyst Switches
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Conventions
For more information on document conventions, refer to Cisco Technical Tips Conventions.
Background Theory
EtherChannel may be configured unconditionally (using channel mode on), or it may be configured by having the switch negotiate the channel with the far end using the Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) (using channel mode desirable).
Note: Catalyst switches running CatOS support PAgP, and therefore desirable mode is recommended for setting up an EtherChannel between these devices. PAgP protects against any misconfigurations between the two devices. Channel mode on can be useful when the far end device does not support PAgP and you need to set up the channel unconditionally. The silent or non-silent keywords are available with auto and desirable channel modes. The silent keyword is enabled by default on all ports for Catalyst 4500/4000 or 6500/6000, and on copper ports of Catalyst 5500/5000 series switches. The non-silent keyword is enabled by default on all fiber ports (FE and Gigabit Ethernet [GE]) for Catalyst 5500/5000 series switches. It is recommended to use the default silent or non-silent keyword when connecting between Cisco switches.
For more details on PAgP and EtherChannel, go to the Technical Documentation for your release of CatOS software found on the Cisco Switches product pages. Refer to the sections Configuring Fast EtherChannel and Gigabit EtherChannel or Configuring EtherChannel. You may wish to use your browser Find feature to locate these sections.
Another good reference is the EtherChannel / Port Aggregation Protocol section of the following document:

Note: Output of the show spantree module/port command for ports 3/1 and 3/2 is identical since these ports are grouped together in one channel with the Channel ID of 865.
Special Consideration Using Unconditional on Channel Mode
Cisco recommends using PAgP for port channel configuration, as described in Background Theory, above. If for any reason you are configuring the EtherChannel unconditionally (using channel mode on), it is recommended that you create a port channel by following the steps below. This avoids possible problems with STP during the configuration process. STP loop detection may disable the ports if one side is configured as a channel before the other side can be configured as a channel.
Set the ports to be used in port channeling to disable mode on the first switch by issuing the set port disable module/port command.
Create the port channel (port group) on the first switch and set the channel mode to on.
Create the port channel on the second switch and set the channel mode to on.
Re-enable the ports that were disabled earlier on the first switch by issuing the set port enable module/port command.
