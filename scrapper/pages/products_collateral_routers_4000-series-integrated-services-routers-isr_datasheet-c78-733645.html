The Cisco® 4000 Integrated Services Router Family Network Interface Module (NIM) supports VDSL2 and ADSL2/2+ on a single WAN interface. The solution provides a secure, cost-effective solution for customers ranging from teleworkers and small businesses to large enterprise branch offices.
Product Overview
The Cisco Multimode VDSL2 and ADSL2/2+ NIM (part number NIM-VAB-A) provides single-port multimode VDSL2 and ADSL2/2+ WAN connectivity (Figure 1).
Figure 1.      Single-Port NIM Supports VDSL2 and ADSL2/2+ for WAN Connectivity
In combination with Cisco 4000 Integrated Services Routers (ISRs), this NIM provides high-speed digital data transmission between customer premises equipment (CPE) and the central-office DSL access multiplexer (DSLAM), usually located on the telephone company premises. Service providers and resellers can offer additional services such as business-class security; voice, video, and data; differentiated classes of service (CoS); and managed network access with Cisco IOS® Software over existing telephony infrastructure.
With Cisco IOS XE Software Release 3.14 and later releases, the single-port multimode VDSL2 and ADSL2/2+ NIM is supported on the following Cisco 4000 routers: Cisco 4321, 4331, 4351, 4431, and 4451.

Applications
Business-Class DSL with WAN Backup
The Cisco 4300 and 4400 Series ISRs offer multiple WAN slots. These routers can be configured with a Network Interface Module card for primary WAN access, providing redundancy for mission-critical applications. The WAN flexibility in these platforms enables the DSL cards with part numbers VDSL2 or ADSL2/2+ Network Interface Module for Annex A (NIM-VAB-A), VDSL2 or ADSL2/2+ Network Interface Module for Annex B/J (NIM-VA-B), and VDSL2 or ADSL2/2+ Network Interface Module for Annex M (NIM-VAB-M) to be used based on the VDSL2 or ADSL2/ADSL2+ supported technology.
Banking
In this scenario, a bank branch office uses the Cisco 4331 with an VDSL2 or ADSL2/2+ Network Interface Module for Annex A (NIM-VAB-A) card and Ethernet connectivity through the front-panel Gigabit Ethernet ports to provide primary and backup WAN access. In addition, the Cisco SM-X 24-Port Layer 2/3 EtherSwitch Service Module is used for connectivity for local bank branch-office servers and teller and ATM machines. This scenario uses the versatility of the Cisco 4331 to enable banking databases to synchronize banking and ATM transactions without any interruption of WAN access, and it provides redundancy for other mission-critical applications.
Business-Class Security
The Cisco 4300 and 4400 Series ISRs with the Network Interface modules can be optimized for Internet security with the Cisco IOS Firewall, supporting stateful-inspection-firewall and Cisco Cloud Web Security (CWS) Connector features. With an always-on DSL connection, Internet security and VPN capabilities are crucial to protecting corporate resources from malicious network attacks. You can enable these features on the Cisco 4000 Series ISRs by purchasing the optional Security Technology License or the AX feature set.
These platforms can also be optimized for VPN to secure the Internet for communications with the same policies and levels of security and performance as a private network. VPNs provide security through encryption tunneling, and the Cisco routers support hardware-based Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES), IP Security (IPsec), and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).These advanced encryption features can be enabled on Cisco ISRs by purchasing the optional Security Technology License or the AX feature set.
Application-Aware Networking with IP Quality of Service
Using Cisco quality-of-service (QoS) features, including Class-Based Weighted Fair Queuing (CBWFQ), Low‑Latency Queuing (LLQ), Weighted Random Early Detection (WRED), and others, Cisco 4000 Series routers with the Cisco Multimode VDSL2 and ADSL2/2+ NIM can help service providers and resellers offer services that can differentiate bandwidth based on the specific application or specific user. For example, network administrators can give traffic from a customer order entry priority over regular internal network traffic.
Performance
VDSL2 and ADSL2/2+ performance is a function of many variables, including the DSLAM line card, DSLAM software version, VDSL profile and band plan, line-noise conditions, loop length, and other environmental factors.
Software Support
The single-port Cisco Multimode VDSL2 and ADSL2/2+ NIM is supported on Cisco IOS XE Software Release 3.14 and later releases on Cisco 4321, 4331, 4351, 4431, and 4451 ISRs.
The VDSL2 and ADSL2/2+ features are supported with the IP Base technology package license for the Cisco 4300 and 4400 Series ISRs.
Platform Support
Multimode DSL (VDSL2 and ADSL2/2+) NIMs are supported only in the onboard NIM slots of the modular Cisco 4000 router platforms. Table 6 provides platform support details.
