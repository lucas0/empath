    Introduction
This document provides guidance on the various Zero Trust Frameworks and their relationship to the Cisco Zero Trust Framework. For each of the Zero Trust Frameworks a mapping to Cisco product is provided.
Cisco Zero Trust Framework
Figure 1.           Cisco Zero Trust Framework
  Security is not a one-size-fits-all and Zero Trust is more than network segmentation. To help understand the architecture, Cisco has broken it down into three pillars:
  ●      User and Device Security: ensure users and devices can be trusted as they access systems, regardless of location
●      Network and Cloud Security: protect all network resources on-prem and in the cloud, and ensure secure access for all connecting users
●      Application and Data Security: prevent unauthorized access within application environments irrespective of where they are hosted
  Zero Trust cannot be solved by a single product.  Zero Trust can only be realized by proper integration of security tools to provide an adaptive, scalable and integrated security solution that applies all of the Zero Trust principles.  In general, excessive use of the “best” point products does not create the cohesive security strategy that Zero Trust can.

  NIST Special Publication 800-207 – Zero Trust Architecture
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) develops cybersecurity standards, guidelines, best practices, and other resources to meet the needs of U.S. industry, federal agencies and the broader public.
NIST defines both Zero Trust and a Zero Trust Architecture as: "Zero trust (ZT) provides a collection of concepts and ideas designed to minimize uncertainty in enforcing accurate, least privilege per-request access decisions in information systems and services in the face of a network viewed as compromised. Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) is an enterprise’s cybersecurity plan that uses zero trust concepts and encompasses component relationships, workflow planning, and access policies. Therefore, a zero trust enterprise is the network infrastructure (physical and virtual) and operational policies that are in place for an enterprise as a product of a ZTA plan." (NIST 800-207 - 2.0 - Zero Trust Basics)

  CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model V2.0
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) leads the Unites States’ national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to our cyber and physical infrastructure.  Their mission expands across three primary areas: cybersecurity, infrastructure security, and emergency communications.
CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model v2.0 is one of many roadmaps that agencies can reference as they transition towards a zero trust architecture. The maturity model aims to assist agencies in the development of zero trust strategies and implementation plans and to present ways in which various CISA services can support zero trust solutions across agencies.
Figure 3.           CISA Zero Trust Maturity Evoluton
  Source: CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model V2.0
Agencies should use the following guiding criteria of each stage to identify maturity for each zero trust technology pillar and provide consistency across the maturity model:
  ●      Traditional—manually configured lifecycles (i.e., from establishment to decommissioning) and assignments of attributes (security and logging); static security policies and solutions that address one pillar at a time with discrete dependencies on external systems; least privilege established only at provisioning; siloed pillars of policy enforcement; manual response and mitigation deployment; and limited correlation of dependencies, logs, and telemetry
●      Initial—starting automation of attribute assignment and configuration of lifecycles, policy decisions and enforcement, and initial cross-pillar solutions with integration of external systems; some responsive changes to least privilege after provisioning; and aggregated visibility for internal systems
●      Advanced—wherever applicable, automated controls for lifecycle and assignment of configurations and policies with cross-pillar coordination; centralized visibility and identity control; policy enforcement integrated across pillars; response to pre-defined mitigations; changes to least privilege based on risk and posture assessments; and building toward enterprise-wide awareness (including externally hosted resources)
●      Optimal—fully automated, just-in-time lifecycles and assignments of attributes to assets and resources that self-report with dynamic policies based on automated/observed triggers; dynamic least privilege access (just-enough and within thresholds) for assets and their respective dependencies enterprise-wide; cross-pillar interoperability with continuous monitoring; and centralized visibility with comprehensive situational awareness
  The following table is the CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model with the mapping to Cisco Products.

DISA Zero Trust Framework
The DISA Zero Trust Framework is a set of security principles and best practices developed by the U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to enhance cybersecurity in government agencies and other organizations. The framework is designed to minimize the risk of cyberattacks and data breaches by assuming that no user, device, or network is inherently trusted, and instead verifying each request before granting access to sensitive resources.
Zero Trust Pillars are identified and are in alignment with the common industry identification of Zero Trust Pillars. A Pillar is a key focus area for implementation of Zero Trust controls. Zero Trust is depicted as interlocking puzzle pieces below that symbolize a data Pillar surrounded by Pillars of protection. All protection Pillars work together to effectively secure the Data Pillar.
Figure 4.           DISA Zero Trust Pillars
  To implement the DISA Zero Trust Framework, organizations typically adopt a multi-layered approach that includes technologies such as network segmentation, identity and access management (IAM), privileged access management (PAM), and continuous monitoring and threat detection tools. This approach helps organizations to maintain a high level of security and reduce the risk of data breaches and cyberattacks.
