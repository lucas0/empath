    Cisco vAnalytics  enables enterprises to take total control of the user experience by offering enhanced visibility into their network and application performance, helping with understanding historical behavior trends for expedited root-cause analysis, and transforming network operations from a reactive model to a predictive model.
Product overview
Cisco vAnalytics is a SaaS product that revolutionizes how organizations monitor and operate their networks by providing actionable insights in a highly visualized and intuitive manner and by automating network operations under a highly predictive model. It aggregates large volumes of telemetry data and correlates application performance with underlying network behavior. As SD-WAN has evolved to connect users across multi-cloud, branch, data center, and the hybrid workforce, enterprises and other organizations are constantly challenged to deliver reliable connectivity, application experience, and security over networks and services they don’t own or directly control. vAnalytics addresses the growing need of enterprises for enhanced visibility and diagnostics to allow them to take control over such a dynamic environment.
vAnalytics enhances network and application visibility, establishes historical benchmarks, and expedites root-cause isolation, ultimately enabling enterprises to take the necessary corrective actions and gain total control of the user experience. vAnalytics is software as a service built on a scalable and cloud-first architecture.
