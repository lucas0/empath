Geofencing
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1
This feature provides a way to restrict a device's location to an operational geographical boundary, and to identify a device's location and report any violations of the configured boundary. If the device is identified to be in violation, you can restrict network access to the device using Cisco vManage operational commands.
In the CLI or a CLI template, configure geofencing coordinates for establishing the location of the device. You can also register for SMS alerts.
Added Support for Configuring Geofencing Using a Cisco System Feature Template
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1
This feature adds support for configuring the geographical boundary of a device using a Cisco System feature template.

Information About Geofencing
Geofencing allows you to define a geographical boundary within which a device can be deployed. When devices are detected outside of the boundary, SMS alerts as well as critical-event alarms can be generated to Cisco vManage.
Global Positioning System (GPS) within a Long-Term Evolution Pluggable Interface Module (PIM) is used for device detection and monitoring in Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
On the device CLI or through a Cisco vManage CLI template, you can configure the following settings:
Base location (latitude and longitude) and a geofence range for device detection
Short-message service (SMS) alert registration for sending SMS messages to a mobile number
GPS enablement on a Long-Term Evolution PIM in the controller cellular 0/x/0 section

Note
You can also enable GPS on a Long-Term Evolution PIM using a feature template.
Starting from Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1, you can configure geofencing using a Cisco System feature template. You can also enable automatic geolocation detection of a device where the device determines its own base location.
In Cisco vManage, you can use operational commands for restricting network access if a device exceeds its geographical boundary.
For more information on the operational commands for restricting network access, see the Cisco SD-WAN Monitor and Maintain Configuration Guide.
Geofencing status alerts are sent to Cisco vManage upon detection of device boundary violations.
