Announcing Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director, Release 6.3.0-684.
What’s New
IMPORTANT: For DMP HDMI-In encoding, be certain to start / stop display streaming when you change source devices (such as from laptop A to laptop B) to ensure the process will perform properly.
IMPORTANT: When upgrading from Release 6.2 SP6, you directly upgrade to Release 6.3-902 SP1. If you already run Release 6.3.0-684, upgrade to Release 6.3.0-902 (SP1). Then upgrade again to Release 6.3.0-1070 SP2 and then Release 6.3.0-1108 SP3.
IMPORTANT: Before upgrading to Release 6.3, verify that your virtual machine meets the minimum requirements for the current deployment. If your virtual machine does not meet the minimum requirements in the Cisco Vision Software Installation and Upgrade Guide, your existing configuration may get downgraded upon installing Release 6.3.
IMPORTANT: After installing or upgrading to Release 6.3, verify and confirm the update and virtual machine profile of the Dynamic Signage Director configuration from TUI.
IMPORTANT: Release 6.3 removes the mandatory need to have an Adobe Flash-compatible browser to use Cisco Vision Director. As stated by the creator of Flash, “Adobe will stop distributing and updating Flash Player after December 31, 2020.” Plan to be on Release 6.3 no later than the end of 2020 calendar year.
https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html
Also, here’s a link to a field notice:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/field-notices/720/fn72069.html
IMPORTANT: We removed the switch import capability in Release 6.3 because the switches that Cisco Vision Director supported in the past no longer work when security updates were applied on their firmware. We are exploring similar functionality for newer switches / firmware in a future release.
IMPORTANT: We use Server-Sent Events (SSE) for communication from server to clients. Server-sent events has connection limitations based on browser implementation. Due to this limitation of SSE, it is not recommended to run our application in more than a single tab.
In the documentation for Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director, we changed the terms “master” to “lead, leader, source or primary,” the term “slave” to “secondary, replica, or follower,” the term “whitelist” to “allowlist,” and the term “blacklist” to “blocklist.” There are currently no changes to the product’s syntax, so these terms are still present in the documentation where the current code requires their use. Where an industry standard exists, such as IEEE terminology, we cannot alter the term until the standards change.
We resolved various defects in this release. For the latest fixes, see Resolved Defects in Release 6.3.0-1108 SP3.
Here’s a quick list of the newest features now available in Release 6.3:
■Turn TVs Off—all accessible in HTML for Administrators and Facility Operators (Turn TVs Off).
■Dynamic Menu Boards—now accessible in HTML and all existing content loads to the Asset Library (Dynamic Menu Boards).
■Manage Software—three new tabs are now available: DMP Firmware (DMP Firmware Image Files) allowing you to upload the latest DMP firmware available for your devices, Licensing (Smart Licensing For Cisco Vision Director), allowing you to better manage your software license information and status, and System Backups Generate or Restore a System Backup.
■ Management Dashboard functionality is split (Management Dashboard—Redesigned for HTML) into a new global navigation icon: System Status (System Status—New Global Navigation Icon), for the server and DMP health and status information and Services conditions; the DMP control and commands portion moved to the Device Management interface (Use Device Management for DMP and TV Controls); and controlling the settings of Cisco Vision Director moved to a new interface called System Configuration (New System Configuration Options) under the Configuration interface (introduced in Release 6.2).
■Configurable Video Layer Ordering—a new display specification parameter allows you to put graphics in between two video layers (Video Layer Ordering).
■All DMP models now support and require firmware 8.2.42. See New DMP Firmware Support.
■Cisco Vision Director server deployments now include mini, small, standard, and large configurations.
Note: Before you perform an upgrade to Release 6.3, review your server configuration, requirements, and limitations. See Cisco Vision Director Server Deployment Options.
■Channel No Change—The external URL channel no longer reloads on state change when the region content is designated as Channel No Change. See External URL-Based Channel Display Improvement.
■Randomize playlist items ordering. See Randomize Playlist Content Ordering.
■Video Offset Control for Video Walls.
■CV-UHD2 DMP Support HDR/Dolby Vision Content.
■Enhanced Device Management to include much more granularity during Search/Find functions. Moved lots of functionality from Management Dashboard to here, in the Filter box, depending on your choices in drop-downs. See Use Device Management for DMP and TV Controls and Device Management Enhancements. We moved Status, Settings, Display Actions, Console, and Compliance, each with their own set of tabs showing you various statuses of the devices, to this interface.
■Security Enhancements for Local Control API.
■Idle Timeout.
New Cisco Vision Solution Documentation Resources
In May 2020, we added two, new Cisco Vision Solution support documents:
■ Cisco Vision Network, Server, and Video Headend Requirements Guide to help you with your wired system infrastructure set up and hardware solution requirements.
■ Cisco Vision Product Deployment Requirements to help with your installation and deployment requirements.

Smart Licensing For Cisco Vision Director
Cisco Smart Software Licensing is a simplified and standardized process for managing licenses for Cisco products in the cloud. Smart Software Licensing provides complete visibility into license ownership and consumption. It renders a unified experience across all product lines. Using Smart Software Licensing, Cisco products / software can automatically self-register upon configuration, making it easier to manage your software subscriptions. New users will automatically create the association between their purchases and their account at the time of subscription purchase. Our valued customers will have a 90-day grace period, allowing you to evaluate the Smart Software Licensing system and add additional products. At the end of the 90-day trial period, you must purchase a license for each product in your deployment.
Release 6.3 now supports Smart Accounts to hold Smart Software Licenses for Cisco Vision Director installations, the DMP licenses, and the language packs. To register a software license, you use your Smart Account. Once you establish a Smart Account, you can begin to link your Cisco Vision Director licenses with our Smart Software Licensing interface. Access Smart Licensing on Cisco Vision Director, through the Manage Software interface.
As an Administrator, click the Licensing tab (Figure 9). The main screen is broken into three portions: the Registration area, the Licensing Status area and the License Usage area at the bottom.
Figure 9 Accessing the Smart Licensing Interface in Cisco Vision Director
  Ultimately, you want to achieve full compliance with all your Cisco Vision Director licenses (Figure 10).
Figure 10 Smart Software License Compliance
  New customers will associate their Cisco Vision Director purchases with Smart Software Licenses associated at the time of purchase. For complete instructions on how to register and reserve a smart software license, see the Software Installation and Upgrade Guide.
Note: Existing customers with legacy licensing can contact askciscovision@cisco.com for conversion assistance.
Management Dashboard—Redesigned for HTML
This release continues the UI updating and includes a significant change of Management Dashboard to HTML. Here is a quick reference on how to access some of the main functionality.

By redesigning Management Dashboard, we made more enhancements to Device Management, Configuration and added a new global navigation icon: System Status. The following lists where the Management Dashboard redesign impacts the UI:
■System Status—New Global Navigation Icon
■Use Device Management for DMP and TV Controls
■New System Configuration Options
System Status—New Global Navigation Icon
We added a new global navigation icon in the center for System Status. This interface has two icons in the left banner:
■ Overview
■Monitor and Status
Overview shows server and DMP health and status information (Figure 11), similar to the functionality from the Dashboard, Summary and Server zone information.
Figure 11 Server Utilization and DMP Summary
  The old Dashboard Monitored Services and Service Alerts (Figure 12) moved to Monitor and Status Services (Figure 13) under the new System Status icon.
Figure 12 Old Dashboard Monitored Services and Service Alerts
  Figure 13 Monitor and Status Services
    For complete information on how to use these new interfaces, see the Cisco Vision Operations Guide Dynamic Signage Director, Release 6.3.
Use Device Management for DMP and TV Controls
We moved DMP and TV Control from Management Dashboard to Device Management. We added two key enhancements in the functionality: 1) filtering and searching of DMPs and 2) sending of commands to those DMPs. The left red box near Get Status (Figure 14) is a drop down with all the commands contained within it (Figure 15). By choosing DMP(s), a command, then clicking Play, commands are sent to the corresponding DMP(s). This closely follows the previous commands and workflow. The Command Status icon to the right of the Play icon is new functionality that gives individual command status and allows per command canceling.
Figure 14 New Device Management Functions
  Figure 15 Device Management Commands
  To search and build sets of DMPs to act on (other than already having them ordered by Zones and Groups as before), the right red box above has a Search glass and a Pin icon. Search devices free-form as before or use the new filtered searches by sliding the toggle in the pop-up (Figure 16). Searching will build a set of matches that then can be acted upon using the Get Status pull-down arrow. To build a set from multiple searches of DMPs, use the Pin icon to add matches to the view and allow individual choosing. Use the check boxes to select a device, adding it to the set. The new functionality is further explained in Release 6.3: Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director Operations Guide.
Figure 16 Find / Search Devices
  New System Configuration Options
The Configuration interface has two new icons on the left banner. Roll over the left blue banner to see the following new menu options:
■ TV Off Configuration — Allows you to quickly assign devices into zones. See Turn TVs Off.
■ System Configuration —Shows much of the Management Dashboard settings functionality.
The old Dashboard Dynamic Signage Director Configuration drawer (Figure 17) is now available from System Configuration (Figure 18).
Figure 17 Dashboard Dynamic Signage Director Configuration Drawer
  Figure 18 Configuration > System Configuration
  Expand all the folders to see full details of each. Select a row in the System Configuration panel and the center panel refreshes. Select a Configuration Property in the center list and the action icons are enabled to Edit, Show/Hide details, or Refresh the list. Use the Edit Configuration pop-up box to Save new settings.
Set parameters for default channel, registry items, and DMP image files in a new System Configuration. These settable parameters came from the Dynamic Signage Director Settings drawer of the Management Dashboard.
Note: Data Integration deployment (from the previous version of Management Dashboard > Advanced tab) is now available in the Data Integration icon in the left banner. This change better associates the action with the configuration.
For details about all these new screens and how to use them, see Release 6.3: Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director Operations Guide and the Release 6.3: Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director Administration Guide.
Video Layer Ordering
In prior releases, video was fixed below graphics and external URLs and always on the bottom layer. By using transparency and sizing, content could be mixed on screen over or along each other, but video could not be overlaid, no matter what was defined in the template. Release 6.3 introduces a new Display Specification Parameter called dmp.layerOrderMode that allows graphics to be sandwiched between two video layers (Figure 19). There are three settings for dmp.layerOrderMode. By using this new display parameter, you can achieve the following:
■VideoOnBottom (same as existing behavior)
■VideoOnTop
■GraphicsInMiddle
In this example, make sure the template used in the script (Figure 20) has the regions layered properly (Video/non-Video/Video) and set the Display Parameter to GraphicsInMiddle. You must reboot the DMP to act on the new display specification parameter. By entering “VideoOnTop” video then would always overlay graphics and “VideoOnBottom” is the legacy behavior.
Figure 19 Video Layer Ordering Ability
  Figure 20 Graphics in the Middle Example in Designer
  To set this: Click Configuration > Devices > Display Specifications > Display Parameters.
IMPORTANT: The Display Specification settings and the Template setting orders need to match.
For complete details on using this new feature, see Release 6.3: Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director Operations Guide.
New DMP Firmware Support
WHAT IS IT
Release 6.3 SP3 use firmware, 8.2.42. All the supported DMPs use this new firmware. Firmware 8.2.42 uses
Chromium 69.
WHY USE IT
This is the latest verified and tested DMP firmware release for Cisco Vision Director 6.3.
WHERE TO CONFIGURE IT
See Firmware Configuration for all Media Players.
Cisco Vision Director Server Deployment Options
We added two more options for Cisco Vision Director server deployment—the Mini Deployment and the Large Deployment. Use TUI to verify server is within these specifications. Choose Cisco Vision Server Administration > Setup Server Profile. See Release 6.3: Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director Administration Guide for full details. Here are the limitations at a glance.

The Mini and Small differ in clock speed. During a full installation, the installer will detect and select a server size, based on resources available to the VM: RAM, CPU clock speed, and vCPU count. We increased the number of groups, zones, and running scripts for a standard server profile.
IMPORTANT:
■Before upgrading to Release 6.3, verify that your virtual machine meets the minimum requirements for the current deployment. If your virtual machine does not meet the minimum requirements in Cisco Vision Software Installation and Upgrade Guide, your existing configuration may get downgraded upon installing Release 6.3.
■After installing or upgrading to Release 6.3, verify and confirm the update and virtual machine profile of the Dynamic Signage Director configuration from TUI.
External URL-Based Channel Display Improvement
Channel No Change is a script state action. In prior releases, this command applies only to video channels, and is provided so that a state action will not need to re-tune to the streamed video channel. For URL channels, the Channel No Change will reload the page. This improvement makes URL channels on par with video channels.
For example, the Channel No Change option for multicast video allows a second layer of content to be overlaid and yet continue to play the multicast video in the background, so when the overlying content is dismissed, the video reappears without interruption.
This URL channel can be unloaded if either (or both) the primary and secondary video players are set.
If the current state is playing a URL channel, when you switch to the next state containing Channel No Change, the URL channel is not loaded again. It retains the dimensions. If the next state puts the URL channel in a different sized region, based on the template and content, the channel reloads as per the defined dimensions.
To set Channel No Change:
1. In the Edit Actions box, click on the region of the template you want to assign.
2. Click the Channels tab.
3. Select Channel No Change to that region.
4. Click OK.
Figure 21 Assign Channel No Change to a Region of your Template
  Randomize Playlist Content Ordering
New in Release 6.3 is the ability to create a “random” playout of your content.
To create a “shuffled” playlist:
1. Click Library, click Playlist.
2. Click List view.
3. In the Playlist Items list, select Randomize icon (Figure 22). Your content order changes. The playout will be in the random order shown.
Figure 22 Random Playout of Content in a Playlist
  Video Offset Control for Video Walls
WHAT IS IT
Improvements to your snappy video wall creations using video file contents.
WHY USE IT
These improvements compensate for the TV painting/scanning process and may be useful for fast-moving video.
IMPORTANT: For the best display output on your video wall, the settings for the frame rates must match on all of the following:

Key Considerations for This Release
TIP: Use the TUI to upgrade the Cisco Vision Director Release 6.3 software. See Release 6.3: Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director System Administration Guide . This reduces the possibility of interruption during the upgrade process. See Upgrade Paths.
IMPORTANT NOTES:
1. Backup your data before upgrading.
2. For all upgrades, reboot Cisco Vision Director after you perform the upgrade.
3. Running Backup:
You can only restore a backup from the same version. In other words: make a backup of your existing release data, before you upgrade to 6.3. Then, if something goes wrong during the upgrade, you can revert to the Release 6.2.0-1113 (SP6) version and restore the 6.2.0-1113 backup.
4. Running a Restore:
Run a restore using TUI. Do not close your browser or refresh the browser session when performing a backup restore. If you do, you cannot tell when the restore process completes. Look at the Log drop-down to see when the restore process completes successfully.
5. Language packs are release-specific. You can install available language packs for Release 6.3, after you have installed or upgraded to Release 6.3 and when the language pack is available. The language packs are compatible with the Service Pack releases.
The upgrade images are available on Cisco.com here:

User Interface Enhancements
Library
The Library screen is the initial landing location when you first log in or upgrade as an Administrator. Upload, organize, and tag assets here. As always, what appears depends on the user’s role and access. Remember, if you enable multi-venue in the System Configuration > Dynamic Signage Director Settings screen, the All Assets option in the Library drop-down is not visible. Also new to the Library interface once you upgrade to this release is the DynamicMenuBoard folder. All your assets get loaded here. For more information on that, see Dynamic Menu Boards.
The More drop-down menu options changed (Figure 30). Management Dashboard is not available here.
Figure 30 More Drop-Down List
  Device Management Enhancements
We made a lot of changes to this interface, adding functionality, status, sending of commands to the DMPs, and information-at-a-glance from the old Management Dashboard screens. In the Get Status box below (Figure 31), are all available actions to perform on a DMP or set of DMPs (see Use Device Management for DMP and TV Controls). Functions depend on which view you use (List view or Thumbnail). Roll over the Play icon, the Command Status and the Export punch list actions. To the far right are the Search glass, Pin icon, Toggle Tree View and Refresh visible list icons. Expand the folders in the Device panel to select a specific DMP. If you select a DMP, five more tabs appear at the bottom portion of your screen, each with their own set of subtabs. Click on any column heading to sort.
■To close the Devices panel, use the Toggle Tree View.
■To get to Visual Monitoring, slide to Thumb Nail View, select a device, and click Visual Monitoring.
■To close the Status and Status Details box to see more devices in the list, use the close X.
■To create an additive search list of devices, use the Pin icon.
Figure 31 Enhanced Device Management Interface
  Notes:
■In Thumbnail view, when you click the device Refresh icon, only the visible DMPs refresh, not the entire list of DMPs in the selected zone.
■In Listview, polling occurs every 60 seconds for cached data.
For complete details on using all the new features here, see Release 6.3: Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director Operations Guide.
Script Management Enhancements
We updated Script Management, moving all the instances to its own tab. Instances only load when you select a script from the left panel. The Summary panel lists the scripts in the system. The Start and Stop icons (boxed in red) act upon the selected script (Figure 32). Use the script filter pull-down arrow to display: Scheduled and Running, Running, Scheduled, or Blocked scripts.
Figure 32 Script Management Improvements
  The Instances tab is only for managing them. Click on an instance and use the action icons Delete, Edit (rename), or Refresh (Figure 33). Use the Filter drop-down to choose what displays. We moved the criteria in the filters to what’s relevant to the panel. The default is All.
Figure 33 Managing an Instance
  Another thing of note is that you can select multiple instances with the check boxes and click Remove to delete them. A confirmation Warning box appears as a courtesy. You cannot delete a Running script. The Remove icon is disabled.
If you start a script, you see the progress of the script while it prepares to run. Click Refresh to update the window or wait.
If you filter the Instances in your panel, navigate away and come back to it, the filter persists, for example, showing all the Scheduled instances.
Data Integration Enhancements
To simplify data integration workflow, we added a Manage tab under Data Integration (Figure 34). Click Configuration > Data Integration > Manage tab. Now, after deploying/undeploying, instead of switching to Management Dashboard, you can do these functions easily from this interface.
Figure 34 Data Integration Manage and Control
  Select an action and click the Play icon.
Generate or Restore a System Backup
We moved system backup to the Manage Software Interface and created a new tab: System Backups. Click the + icon to start creating a backup. Click Restore to restore the system to a previous state. Use the Log arrow to see the log file information.
Figure 35 Generating a System Backup
  Security Enhancements for Local Control API
You cannot use an HTTP GET method for state changing operations. TV Control via an external application that uses HTTP GET method will no longer work by default. Use the new registry key:
security.compatibility.localctl.gets
If you set to false : default (disallow GET on TV state changing commands)
If you set to true : Enable backward compatibility
Idle Timeout
Session expiration when the UI becomes idle after 30 minutes. Content upload is not constrained by 30 minutes of “inactivity.” The UI takes you to the login page when the session times out.
If a page does not populate with data, this is likely due to session timeout. Reload the page or navigate to the login page.
Password Updates
■When you change your password, you see a password strength bar. As you enter allowed characters, the bar changes from red to green.
■When you change your password, you must provide your current password.

Updates
Automated Content Import to Library Inbox
In Release 6.2, we introduced running an automated import of content from a defined source. The source may be a defined SFTP location. There can be multiple SFTP locations defined in the system. This feature can be registered as a task and the task configured to run every day.
Important Notes:
■A file that is already imported to Cisco Vision Director using the SFTP feature cannot be reimported with the same content name.
■If you did not specify a Folder in the import action, you must move all the files to the correct Workspace folder or subfolders you’ve created. Otherwise the content is not available to use in a playlist.
■If you delete a site, the site is not visible in the list. However, the site details are not removed until the scheduled task runs. The default is 8:00 am.
To create a site with the same name before the scheduled task runs:
1. Click Configuration > System Configuration > Scheduled Tasks > ContentImportDelete (Figure 42). Click Edit. The Schedule Task — Edit dialog box appears.
Figure 42 ContentImportDelete Task
  2. Change the Task Time. Choose the Servers. Click Save.
This allows you to add the same site details the same day.
Internationalization and Localization
Caution: A Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director system that is using language support from Release 6.3, will lose that support when upgraded until language packs for the new release are available and installed.
Internationalization (i18n)
Internationalization (known as i18n) support refers to the software infrastructure that is designed to accommodate multiple language translations (localization) without requiring additional engineering changes to that software.
The Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director Release 6.3 software supports i18n for the following general areas of the solution:
■Dynamic Menu Board application
■IP Phone user interface
■Software Manager
■TV user interface
Localization (L10n)
Localization (known as L10n) refers to the implementation of the specific regional language translation support within a software interface that has been designed for i18n. English is the default language.
Note: Certain locales are not supported, such as right-to-left languages.
Language Packs for Localization
Note: Language packs are release-specific. They follow the release of a Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director version. Install available language packs after you install or upgrade to a release. Language packs are posted in the same download location on cisco.com as the release.
Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director Release 6.3 provides the flexibility to upload and install only the specific language(s) that you want to support through the independent installation of Language Packs. The upload and installation of the language packs is performed using the Software Manager from the Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director main menu. For more information about how to install language packs, see the Cisco Vision Software Installation and Upgrade Guide: Dynamic Signage Director Release 6.3.
The supported languages in Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director Release 6.3.0-684 and later are:
■Deutsch (de_DE)
■English (en_US). This is the default locale in all Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director releases.
■French (fr_FR)
■Japanese (jp_JN)
■Portuguese (pt_BR)
■Russian (ru_RU)
■Simplified Chinese (zh_CN)
■Spanish (es_ES)
■Swedish (sv_SE)
■Traditional Chinese (zh_TW)
■Turkish (tr_TR)
For more information about requirements and restrictions in configuring localization in Cisco StadiumVision Director, including IP phone support, see the Cisco StadiumVision Director Localization Guide.

TIP: Use the TUI within the VM console to upgrade to the Cisco Vision Director Release 6.3 software. This reduces the possibility of interruption during the upgrade process and provides a more secure connection and recovery process. See the Release 6.3: Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director System Administration Guide .
ISO Files
ISO files are packaged images that are available in two versions:
■An ISO full image—The full ISO file is to be installed only on brand new Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director virtual machines that have no prior Cisco Vision Director (or StadiumVision) software version installed.
■An ISO upgrade image—The upgrade ISO file is built for processing using the TUI upgrade utility or Software Manager.
Note: Use the ISO upgrade image to upgrade from Release 6.3.0-902 to the current Release 6.3.0-1108.
IMPORTANT : For Release 6.3, full image and upgrade image ISOs files use SHA-512 checksum. Download and use the SHA-512 checksum file. See Changes to the TUI Interface.
Note : For the Language Packs, the RPM will show sha-512 checksum.
