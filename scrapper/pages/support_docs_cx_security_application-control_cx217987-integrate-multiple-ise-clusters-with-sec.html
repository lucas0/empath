Introduction
This document describes the procedure to send Security Group Tag (SGT) information from multiple ISE Deployments to a single Cisco Secure Web Appliance (Formally Web Security Appliance WSA) through pxGrid in order to take advantage of SGT-Based Web Access Policies in a TrustSec deployment.
Prior to version 14.5, Secure Web Appliance can only integrate with a single ISE cluster for identity policies based on SGT. With the introduction of this new version, Secure Web Appliance can now interoperate with information from multiple ISE clusters with a separate ISE node that aggregates between them. This brings great benefit and enables us to export user data from different ISE clusters and the liberty to control the exit point a user can use without the need for a 1:1 integration.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:
Identity Services Engine (ISE)
Secure Web Appliance
RADIUS protocol
TrustSec
pxGrid
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
Secure Web Appliance 14.5
ISE version 3.1 P3
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Limitations
All ISE Cluster need to maintain uniform mappings for SGTs.
ISE Aggregation Node must have the SGTs name/number of the rest of the ISE clusters.
Secure Web Appliance can only identify policy (Access/Decryption/Routing) based on SGT Tag and not group nor username.
Reporting and Tracking is SGT based.
Existing ISE/Secure Web Appliance sizing parameters continue to apply for this feature.
Network Diagram
Process:
1. When the end user connects to the network, they receive an SGT based on Authorization policies in ISE.
2. The different ISE clusters then send this SGT information in form of SGT-IP mappings to ISE Aggregation Node through SXP.
3. ISE Aggregation Node receive this information and share with the single Secure Web Appliance through pxGrid.
4. Secure Web Appliance uses the SGT information it has learnt to provide access to users based on Web Access Policies.

Here you can see an endpoint from ISE Cluster 2 assigned an SGT after successful authentication and authorization:
SXP Mappings
Since SXP communication is enabled between the cluster ISE nodes and ISE aggregation node, these SGT-IP mappings are learned by ISE aggregation through SXP:
These SXP mappings, from different ISE clusters, are then sent to WSA over pxGrid through the ISE aggregation node:
SGT based policy enforcment
Here you can see the different endpoints match its respective policies and traffic are blocked based on their SGT:
