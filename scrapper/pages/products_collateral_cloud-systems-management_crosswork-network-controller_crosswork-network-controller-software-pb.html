Cisco Crosswork Network Controller Software Release Delivery
Cisco is introducing an updated software release delivery model and specific EOL guidelines starting with the Cisco Crosswork Network Controller 3.0 software release.
Types of Software Releases
The Cisco Crosswork Network Controller Software model has three types of software releases. Each release type has its own content, scope and release frequency. Major and minor releases are time-based with 6-month cadence. The patch is released on per-need basis to address critical software defects.
The examples in these guidelines use the X.Y.Z format for release version numbers, for example 2.1.1.
Likely to cause a change to X:
●      Introduce significant market value, including infrastructure or architectural changes, new use-cases. For example, Release 2.0 introduced Clustering based High Availability architecture.
Likely to cause a change to Y:
●      New functions, features and enhancement to existing capabilities.
Likely to cause a change to Z:
●      Bug fixes. For example, a patch release can include security patches and fixes to CFDs (Customer Found Defects).
Cisco may alter the frequency of this release interval upon customers' feedback and market conditions in the future, but every attempt is made to maintain a time-based release.
