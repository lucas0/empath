Feature Description
Cisco SD-WAN Getting Started
Support for Deploying Cisco Catalyst 8000V Instances for Supported Cloud Services Provider Platforms
Starting from this release, Cisco Catalyst 8000V instances can be deployed on Cloud Services Provider portals such as Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services.
Support for Managing Root CA Certificates in Cisco vManage
This feature enables you to add and manage root certificate authority (CA) certificates.
Support for Subject Alternative Name (SAN)
This feature enables you to configure subject altenative name (SAN) DNS Names or uniform resource identifiers (URIs). It enables multiple host names and URIs to use the same SSL certificate.
Upgrade the Software of Cisco ISR1100 Series Integrated Services Routers to Cisco IOS XE
This release introduces Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN support for Cisco ISR1100 Series Integrated Services Routers (Cisco ISR1100-4G, Cisco ISR1100-6G, and Cisco ISR1100-4GLTE). These devices can use either Cisco vEdge software or Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN. You can upgrade these routers from Cisco vEdge software to Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN, or vice-versa.
One Touch Provisioning: Onboard Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices Using Generic Bootstrap Configuration
You can generate a generic bootstrap configuration on Cisco vManage and use this configuration to onboard multiple Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. When you boot a device with the generic bootstrap configuration, the device is listed on Cisco vManage as an unclaimed WAN edge device. To complete the onboarding, claim the device on Cisco vManage and attach a device template that configures the system IP address and site ID.
Systems and Interfaces
Type 6 Passwords on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Routers
This feature allows you to use type 6 passwords that use secure reversible encryption. This encryption provides enhanced security by using more secure algorithms to encrypt your passwords. These passwords are supported for the templates detailed in .
Configure a Cellular Gateway
This feature provides templates for configuring a supported cellular gateway as an IP pass-through device.
This release supports the Cisco Cellular Gateway CG418-E.
Cisco SD-WAN Multitenancy
With Cisco SD-WAN multitenancy, a service provider can manage multiple customers, called tenants, from Cisco vManage. In a multitenant Cisco SD-WAN deployment, tenants share Cisco vManage instances, Cisco vBond Orchestrators and Cisco vSmart Controllers. Tenant data is logically isolated on these shared resources.
Qualified Commands for Cisco IOS XE Release 17.4.1a
Starting Cisco IOS XE Release 17.4.1a, you can use additional commands in CLI Add-on feature templates.
Jumbo Frames Support
Jumbo Frames are supported for 1 GE interfaces on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. Starting Cisco IOS XE Release 17.4.1a, the MTU can range from 576 through 9216 bytes on these 1 GE interfaces.
Routing
Ability to Match and Set Communities during BGP to OMP Redistribution
This feature enhances the implementation of match and set clauses for redistribution from BGP to OMP and vice versa on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. You can redistribute the routes from a BGP into an OMP routing process, using the redistribute command in router configuration mode. The route-maps are defined locally on each device to manipulate communities. The following commands are updated:
route-map
advertise bgp route-map bgp-to-omp
redistribute omp route-map omp-to-bgp
Policies
Policy Matching with ICMP Message
This feature provides support for a new match condition that you can use to specify a list of ICMP messages for centralized data policies, localized data policies, and Application-Aware Routing policies.
For information on matching ICMP messages in a centralized data policy, see Match Parameters - VPN List.
For information on matching ICMP messages in a localized data policy, see Match Parameters.
For information on matching ICMP messages in an Application-Aware Routing policy, see Structural Components of Policy Configuration for Application-Aware Routing.
Traffic Redirection to SIG Using Data Policy
With this feature, while creating a data policy, you can define an application list along with other match criteria and redirect the application traffic to a Secure Internet Gateway (SIG).
Enhanced Policy Based Routing for Cisco SD-WAN
This release extends Enhanced Policy Based Routing (ePBR) to Cisco SD-WAN. ePBR is a protocol-independent traffic-steering mechanism that routes traffic based on flexible policies for traffic flows. You can create ePBR policies using CLI add-on templates in Cisco vManage.
Per-class Application-Aware Routing
This feature enahances the capabilities of directing traffic to next-hop addresses based on the SLA definitions. These SLA definitions along with the policy to match and classify traffic types can be used to direct traffic over specific Cisco SD-WAN tunnels. The SLA definition comprises of values of loss, latency and jitter, which are measured using the BFD channel that exists between two TLOCs.
FNF Support for IPv6 and Cache Size Modification
This feature enables export of packet to external collector over IPv6 transport on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices and provides the visibility of IPv6 network traffic. If you want to monitor IPv4 and IPv6 traffic together, this feature enables you to modify the cache size on the data plane. Cisco Flexible NetFlow (FNF) is a technology that provides customized visibility into network traffic. In Cisco SD-WAN, FNF enables exporting data to Cisco vManage which makes it easy for the customers to monitor and improve their network.
Security
Support for Rule Sets
This feature allows you to create sets of rules called rule sets. Rule sets are a method to create multiple rules that have the same intent. You can also re-use rule sets between security policies.
Configure Port-Scanning Detection Using a CLI Template
This feature lets you configure port-scanning detection and apply a severity level (low, medium, or high) for identifying and classifying potential attacks using a CLI template.
IPSEC/GRE Tunnel Routing and Load-Balancing Using ECMP
This feature allows you to use the SIG template to steer application traffic to Cisco Umbrella or a Third party SIG Provider. The application traffic is steered to a SIG based on a defined data policy and other match criteria.
This feature also allows you to configure weights for multiple GRE/IPSEC tunnels for distribution of traffic over multiple tunnels. Equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) routing and load balancing is supported on multiple GRE/IPSEC tunnels.
TCP Optimization
Support for Multiple, External AppQoE Service Nodes
This feature allows you to configure multiple AppQoE service nodes that are external to the intercepting edge routers or AppQoE service controllers. It extends AppQoE support to edge routers in which AppQoE can't run as an integrated service node. This feature also allows AppQoE to scale, where integrated AppQoE has limitations on the throughput and number of connections. The ability to configure multiple AppQoE service nodes help meet the scale and throughput requirements of large enterprise sites, such as data centers.
Cloud OnRamp
Azure Government Cloud Support for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices
This feature allows you to configure the Cisco Catalyst 8000V devices on Microsoft Azure Government Cloud. With these cloud devices now supported on Microsoft Azure Government Cloud, Government Cloud customers can use the same advanced routing and security benefits, which are already available on Azure public cloud.
AWS Government Cloud Support for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices
Starting from this release, Cisco Catalyst 8000V devices are supported on AWS Government Cloud.
Application Feedback Metrics for Office 365 Best Path Selection on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices
This feature adds new metrics as inputs to the best-path selection algorithm for Office 365 traffic. The new inputs include best-path metrics from Microsoft Cloud Services. The feature also provides a new page for viewing detailed logs of the input data used by the best path algorithm.
Automated Integration of Azure Virtual WAN and Cisco SD-WAN
This feature enhances Cloud OnRamp integration with Microsoft Azure by allowing Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge Software (Cisco Catalyst 8000V) to be deployed inside the Azure Virtual WAN Hub instead of deploying it in transit VNets. It also automates the Cisco SD-WAN fabric connection to Azure Virtual WAN Hub through Cisco Catalyst 8000V. The connectivity between inter-region Azure Virtual WAN Hubs is also supported.
In addition, you can convert the Azure virtual WAN hubs created using Cisco vManage into secured hubs by deploying Azure firewall inside them. However, secured virtual hubs can only be configured using the Microsoft Azure portal.
Integration of Cisco SD-WAN and Azure Virtual WAN Hub Using Azure Portal
As part of the integration of Cisco SD-WAN with Azure Virtual WAN, you can also use the Azure portal to upload bootstrap configuration files for Cisco Catalyst 8000V instances. These instances can then be used to create a virtual WAN hub using the Azure portal.
Support for Cisco Cloud Services Platform, CSP-5456 (Cloud onRamp for Colocation)
Starting from this release, Cisco CSP-5456 is supported on the Cloud onRamp for Colocation solution. The CSP-5456 offers a higher capacity of 56 cores, which maximizes the placement of VNFs in service chains.
Support for Cisco Catalyst 8000V Devices (Cloud onRamp for Colocation)
Starting from this release, Cisco Catalyst 8000V devices are now supported as a validated VNF in the Cloud onRamp for Colocation solution.
Onboarding CSP Device with Day-0 Configuration Using USB Drive (Cloud onRamp for Colocation)
This feature enables you to onboard CSP devices by loading the Day-0 configuration file to a USB drive. Use this onboarding option when you can't access the Internet to reach the Plug-and-Play Connect server.
Monitor and Maintain
Ethernet Connectivity Fault Management Support on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices
Starting from this release Cisco SD-WAN supports the Ethernet Connectivity Fault Management functionality on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. This feature helps to monitor the Carrier Ethernet Network links.
Binary Trace for Cisco SD-WAN Daemons
Binary trace enhances the troubleshooting of Cisco SD-WAN daemons. Binary trace logs messages from the daemons in a binary format. Messages are logged faster in the binary format, improving the logging performance, and use lesser storage space than in the ASCII format. The binary trace CLI allows you to set the debug levels for additional process modules compared to the debug command.
From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.4.1a, binary trace is supported for the following Cisco SD-WAN daemons:
fpmd
ftm
ompd
vdaemon
cfgmgr
Cisco SD-WAN Command Reference Guide

This feature provides validated support for disaster recovery for a 6 node Cisco vManage cluster.
New and Enhanced Hardware Features
New Features
Support for UCS-E module—This feature adds a UCS-E template in Cisco vManage for configuring Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) E-Series servers. For related information, see Getting Started Guide for Cisco UCS E-Series Servers and the Cisco UCS E-Series Network Compute Engine and Configuring Devices using vManage.

Note
Currently, backplane interfaces are not supported for UCS-E module. Only external connectivity is supported.
Support for Cisco IR1101 Integrated Services Router Rugged—Cisco SD-WAN capability can now be enabled onCisco IR1101 Integrated Services Router Rugged. The following notes apply to this support:
Controller devices (Cisco vBond orchestrators, Cisco vManage NMSs, and Cisco vSmart controllers) must run Cisco SD-WAN Release 19.2 or later.
The default topology is full mesh, but the hub and spoke topology is often used for IoT applications.
Cisco SD-WAN support on the Cisco IR1101 Integrated Services Router Rugged requires Cisco IOS-XE Release 16.12.
The Cisco IR1101 Integrated Services Router Rugged has four fixed switch-ports. Make sure to select the correct template.
The CLI template is not currently supported.
Starting from Cisco IOS-XE Release 16.12.1, Cisco IR1101 Integrated Services Router Rugged has dual LTE support with LTE extension module.
We recommend using up to 50 BFD sessions for scaling.
Important Notes, Known Behavior, and Workaround
From Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.4.1.1, Microsoft Azure environment is supported for deploying Cisco SD-WAN controllers (Cisco vBond orchestrator, Cisco vSmart controller, and Cisco vManage). The support is limited to Cisco SD-WAN cloud-based deployments only.
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices with the SFP-10G-SR module do not support online insertion and removal (OIR) of this module.
Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1 implements a hardened security posture to comply with FedRamp guidelines. As a result, your vAnalytics login credentials that are stored locally get erased on upgrading the software, and you cannot access the vAnalytics service directly through Cisco vManage. In this case, log in to vAnalytics using this URL: https://analytics.viptela.com. If you can’t find your vAnalytics login credentials, open a case with Cisco TAC support.
