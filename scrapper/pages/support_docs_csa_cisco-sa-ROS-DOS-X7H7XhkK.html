Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.
Details
The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.
Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows.
Cisco TelePresence CE and RoomOS Software Denial of Service and Information Disclosure Vulnerability
A vulnerability in the web engine feature of Cisco TelePresence CE Software and Cisco RoomOS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition or view sensitive information.
This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of URIs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using debug URIs in the web engine of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to simulate a process crash, resulting in a DoS condition, or view sensitive information about the affected device.
Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
