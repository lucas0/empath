All device and controller combinations listed in this table have been validated. However, there are no software changes in this controller software release, which impact the device-to-controller backwards compatibility for previous releases that are not listed in the table.
UCS-E Series using External Interfaces are supported from Cisco SD-WAN Release 19.2.1 and later releases.
UCS-E Series using Internal Backplane Interfaces such as ucse x/y/0 and ucse x/y/1 have a limited feature support configurable using only Cisco vManage CLI templates, starting from Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.1.1 and later releases.
