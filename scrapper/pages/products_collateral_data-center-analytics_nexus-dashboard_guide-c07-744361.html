    The Cisco Nexus® Dashboard is a single console for full-lifecycle hybrid-cloud network automation and operations where the applications Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights, Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator (ND Orchestrator), and Cisco Nexus Dashboard Data Broker operate. Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC) runs as a service on the Cisco Nexus Dashboard. Third-party ecosystem applications can also run on the Cisco Nexus Dashboard.
This document covers the ordering of Cisco® Data Center Networking and Day-2 operations (Day2Ops) solutions. Components include:
Cisco Nexus Dashboard Platform (formerly Cisco Applications Services Engine): Physical compute, Virtual Nexus Dashboard, Cloud Nexus Dashboard.
Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights: automates troubleshooting, monitoring, auditing, and planning, resulting in rapid troubleshooting, proactive detection of anomalies, and early remediation. It is hosted on the Cisco Nexus Dashboard where Cisco ACI® and NDFC (formerly DCNM) sites are onboarded. Data from these sites is ingested and correlated by Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights.
Ordering is made easy through two simple steps
Step 1: Choose either a Cisco DCN Premier license or a Cisco DCN Day 2 Operations license.
Cisco DCN Premier license (for Greenfield Nexus 9000 customers): provides Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights (formerly Network Insights Resources, Network Insights Advisor, and Cisco Network Assurance Engine). Customers with an existing Cisco DCN Essentials or Advantage subscription can transition to Premier and receive the Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights capabilities.
Cisco DCN Day-2 Operations or D2Ops solution suite (for Brownfield Customers): This is recommended for customers who already have a Cisco DCN Advantage or Essentials license. The add-on license provides Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights. Day-2 operations can be used across Cisco Nexus 9000, Cisco Nexus 3000, and Cisco Nexus 7000 platforms.
Step 2: Choose Cisco Nexus Dashboard Platform: physical, virtual, or cloud.
Cisco Nexus Dashboard Platform (previously known as the Cisco Application Services Engine): The Cisco Nexus Dashboard Platform (ND-CLUSTER-L4) is a purpose-built appliance that is designed to run Cisco applications seamlessly. The Cisco Nexus Dashboard Platform offers high availability, lifecycle management, and network automation for the applications running on it. It is a cluster of three nodes and provides the necessary hardware performance and scale for applications. More information on Cisco Nexus Dashboard.
