Hierarchical SD-WAN: Secondary Regions
Secondary regions provide another facet to the Hierarchical SD-WAN architecture and enable direct tunnel connections between edge routers in different primary access regions. When you assign an edge router a secondary region, the router effectively operates in two regions simultaneously, and has different paths available through its primary and secondary regions.
Hierarchical SD-WAN: Transport Gateways
An edge router or border router that has connections to two networks that lack direct connectivity can function as a transport gateway. This is helpful for enabling connectivity between routers that are configured to be within the same access region, but which do not have direct connectivity.
Hierarchical SD-WAN: Router Affinity
Often a router has multiple options to choose for the next hop when routing a flow to its destination. When multiple devices can serve as the next hop for a flow, you can specify the order of preference among the devices by configuring router affinity groups. The result is that a router attempts to use a route to the next-hop device of highest preference first, and if that device is not available, it attempts to use a route to the next-hop device of the next lower preference. Affinity groups enable this functionality without requiring complex control policies.
Match Traffic by Destination: Access Region, Core Region, or Service VPN
You can apply a policy to traffic whose destination is any one of the following—access region, core region, service VPN. Use this match condition for data policy or application route policy on a border router.
Match Routes According to Path Type
When configuring a control policy for a Hierarchical SD-WAN architecture, you can match routes according to whether the route uses a hierarchical path, a direct path, or a transport gateway path.
