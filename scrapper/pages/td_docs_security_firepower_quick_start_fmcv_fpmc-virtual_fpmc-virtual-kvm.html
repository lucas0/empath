About Deployment Using KVM
KVM is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions (such as Intel VT). It consists of a loadable kernel module, kvm.ko, that provides the core virtualization infrastructure and a processor specific module, such as kvm-intel.ko.
Management Center Virtual Requires 28 GB RAM for Upgrade (6.6.0+)
The management center virtual platform has introduced a new memory check during upgrade. The management center virtual upgrades to Version 6.6.0+ will fail if you allocate less than 28 GB RAM to the virtual appliance.

Important
We recommend you do not decrease the default settings: 32 GB RAM for most management center virtual instances, 64 GB RAM for the management center virtual 300 (FMCv300). To improve performance, you can always increase a virtual appliance’s memory and number of CPUs, depending on your available resources.
As a result of this memory check, we will not be able to support lower memory instances on supported platforms.
Memory and Resource Requirements
You can run multiple virtual machines running unmodified OS images using KVM. Each virtual machine has private virtualized hardware: a network card, disk, graphics adapter, and so forth. See the Cisco Firepower Compatibility Guide for hypervisor compatibility.

Important
When upgrading the management center virtual, check the latest Release Notes for details on whether a new release affects your environment. You may be required to increase resources to deploy the latest version.
When you upgrade, you add the latest features and fixes that help improve the security capabilities and performance of your deployment.
The specific hardware used for the management center virtual deployments can vary, depending on the number of instances deployed and usage requirements. Each virtual appliance you create requires a minimum resource allocation—memory, number of CPUs, and disk space—on the host machine.
The following lists the recommended and default settings for the management center virtual appliance on KVM:
Processors
Requires 4 vCPUs
Memory
Minimum required 28 / Recommended (default) 32 GB RAM

Prerequisites for Deployment Using KVM
Download the management center virtual qcow2 file from Cisco.com and put it on your Linux host:
https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html
A Cisco.com login and Cisco service contract are required.
For the purpose of the sample deployment in this document, we assume you are using Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. Install the following packages on top of the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS host:
qemu-kvm
libvirt-bin
bridge-utils
virt-manager
virtinst
virsh tools
genisoimage
Performance is affected by the host and its configuration. You can maximize the throughput on KVM by tuning your host. For generic host-tuning concepts, see Network Function Virtualization: Quality of Service in Broadband Remote Access Servers with Linux and Intel Architecture.
Useful optimizations for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS include the following:
macvtap—High performance Linux bridge; you can use macvtap instead of a Linux bridge. Note that you must configure specific settings to use macvtap instead of the Linux bridge.
Transparent Huge Pages—Increases memory page size and is on by default in Ubuntu 18.04.
Hyperthread disabled—Reduces two vCPUs to one single core.
txqueuelength—Increases the default txqueuelength to 4000 packets and reduces drop rate.
pinning—Pins qemu and vhost processes to specific CPU cores; under certain conditions, pinning is a significant boost to performance.
For information on optimizing a RHEL-based distribution, see Red Hat Enterprise Linux6 Virtualization Tuning and Optimization Guide.
Guidelines and Limitations
The management center virtual appliances do not have serial numbers. The System > Configuration page will show either None or Not Specified depending on the virtual platform.
Nested hypervisors (KVM running on top of VMware/ESXi) are not supported. Only bare-metal KVM deployments are supported.
Cloning a virtual machine is not supported.
High Availability support
Management Center Virtual 300 (FMCv300) for KVM—A new scaled management center virtual image is available for KVM that supports managing up to 300 devices and has higher disk capacity.
Management Center Virtual High Availability (HA) is supported.
The two management center virtual appliances in a high availability configuration must be the same model. You cannot pair the management center virtual with the management center virtual 300.
To establish the management center virtual HA, management center virtual requires an extra management center virtual license entitlement for each Secure Firewall Threat Defense (formerly Firepower Threat Defense) device that it manages in the HA configuration. However, the required threat defense feature license entitlement for each threat defense device has no change regardless of the management center virtual HA configuration. See License Requirements for threat defense devices in a High Availability Pair in the Secure Firewall Management Center Device Configuration Guide for guidelines about licensing.
If you break the management center virtual HA pair, the extra management center virtual license entitlement is released, and you need only one entitlement for each threat defense device. See High Availability in the Secure Firewall Management Center Device Configuration Guide for more information and guidelines about high availability.
Prepare the Day 0 Configuration File
You can prepare a Day 0 configuration file before you launch the management center virtual. The Day 0 configuration is a text file that contains the initial configuration data that gets applied at the time a virtual machine is deployed. This initial configuration is placed into a text file named “day0-config” in a working directory you chose, and is manipulated into a day0.iso file that is mounted and read on first boot.

Note
The day0.iso file must be available during first boot.
If you deploy with a Day 0 configuration file, the process allows you to perform the entire initial setup for the management center virtual appliance. You can specify:
EULA acceptance
A host name for the system
A new administrator password for the admin account
Network settings that allow the appliance to communicate on your management network If you deploy without a Day 0 configuration file, you must configure System-required settings after launch; see Deploy Without the Day 0 Configuration File for more information.

Note
We use Linux in this example, but there are similar utilities for Windows.
Leave both DNS entries empty to use the default Cisco Umbrella DNS servers. To operate in a non-DNS environment, set both entries to “None” (not case sensitive).
Procedure
Step 1
Enter the CLI configuration for the management center virtual network settings in a text file called “day0-config”.
Example:
#FMC
{
    "EULA": "accept",
    "Hostname": "FMC-Production",
    "AdminPassword": "r2M$9^Uk69##",
    "DNS1": "10.1.1.5",
    "DNS2": "192.168.1.67",
    
    "IPv4Mode": "manual",
    "IPv4Addr": "10.12.129.45",
    "IPv4Mask": "255.255.0.0",
    "IPv4Gw": "10.12.0.1",
    "IPv6Mode": "enabled",
    "IPv6Addr": "2001:db8::a111:b221:1:abca/96",
    "IPv6Mask": "",
    "IPv6Gw": "",
}
Step 2
Generate the virtual CD-ROM by converting the text file to an ISO file:
Example:
/usr/bin/genisoimage -r -o day0.iso day0-config
or
Example:
/usr/bin/mkisofs -r -o day0.iso day0-config
Step 3
Repeat to create unique default configuration files for each management center virtual you want to deploy.
What to do next
If using virt-install, add the following line to the virt-install command:
--disk path=/home/user/day0.iso,format=iso,device=cdrom \
If using virt-manager, you can create a virtual CD-ROM using the virt-manager GUI; see Launch Using Virtual Machine Manager.
Launch the Management Center Virtual
You can launch the management center virtual on KVM using the following methods:
Using a Deployment Script—Use a virt-install based deployment script to launch the management center virtual; see Launch Using a Deployment Script.
Using Virtual Machine Manager—Use virt-manager, a graphical tool for creating and managing KVM guest virtual machines, to launch the management center virtual; see Launch Using Virtual Machine Manager.
Using OpenStack—Use an OpenStack environment to launch the management center virtual; see Launch Using OpenStack.
You can also choose to deploy the management center virtual without the Day 0 configuration file. This requires you to complete the initial setup using the appliance’s CLI or the web interface.

Before you begin
Be aware that you can optimize performance by selecting the best guest caching mode for your environment. The cache mode in use will affect whether data loss occurs, and the cache mode can also affect disk performance.
Each KVM guest disk interface can have one of the following cache modes specified: writethrough, writeback, none, directsync, or unsafe. The writethrough mode provides read caching; writeback provides read and write caching; directsync bypasses the host page cache; unsafe may cache all content and ignore flush requests from the guest.
A cache=writethrough will help reduce file corruption on KVM guest machines when the host experiences abrupt losses of power. We recommend that you use writethrough mode.
However, cache=writethrough can also affect disk performance due to more disk I/O writes than cache=none.
If you remove the cache parameter on the --disk option, the default is writethrough.
Not specifying a cache option may also significantly reduce the time required for the VM creation. This is due to the fact that some older RAID controllers have poor disk caching capability. Hence, disabling disk caching (cache=none) and thus defaulting to writethrough, helps ensure data integrity.
Procedure
Step 1
Create a virt-install script called “virt_install_fmc.sh”.
The name of the management center virtual instance must be unique across all other virtual machines (VMs) on this KVM host. The management center virtual can support one network interface. The virtual NIC must be Virtio.
Example:
virt-install \
    --connect=qemu:///system \
    --network network=default,model=virtio \
    --name=fmcv \
    --arch=x86_64 \
    --cpu host \
    --vcpus=4 \
    --ram=8192 \
    --os-type=generic \
    --virt-type=kvm \
    --import \
    --watchdog i6300esb,action=reset \
    --disk path=<fmc_filename>.qcow2,format=qcow2,device=disk,bus=virtio,cache=writethrough \
    --disk path=<day0_filename>.iso,format=iso,device=cdrom \
    --console pty,target_type=serial \
    --serial tcp,host=127.0.0.1:<port>,mode=bind,protocol=telnet \
    --force
Note
  In the deployment script, ensure to set the value of the --os-type parameter to generic for the deployment process to correctly identify the platform on which the virtual instance is deployed.
Step 2
Run the virt_install script:
Example:
/usr/bin/virt_install_fmc.sh
Starting install...
Creating domain...
A window appears displaying the console of the VM. You can see that the VM is booting. It takes a few minutes for the VM to boot. Once the VM stops booting you can issue CLI commands from the console screen.
Launch Using Virtual Machine Manager
Use virt-manager, also known as Virtual Machine Manager, to launch the management center virtual. virt-manager is a graphical tool for creating and managing guest virtual machines.
Procedure
Step 1
Start virt-manager (Applications > System Tools > Virtual Machine Manager).
You may be asked to select the hypervisor and/or enter your root password.
Step 2
Click the button in the top left corner to open the New VM wizard.
Step 3
Enter the virtual machine details:
For the operating system, select Import existing disk image.
This method allows you to import a disk image (containing a pre-installed, bootable operating system) to it.
Click Forward to continue.
Step 4
Load the disk image:
Click Browse... to select the image file.
Choose Use Generic for the OS type.
Click Forward to continue.
Step 5
Configure the memory and CPU options:
Set Memory (RAM) to 8192.
Set CPUs to 4.
Click Forward to continue.
Step 6
Check the Customize configuration before install box, specify a Name, then click Finish.
Doing so opens another wizard that allows you to add, remove, and configure the virtual machine's hardware settings.
Step 7
Modify the CPU configuration.
From the left panel, select Processor, then select Configuration > Copy host CPU configuration.
This applies the physical host's CPU model and configuration to your virtual machine.
Step 8
8. Configure the Virtual Disk:
From the left panel, select Disk 1.
Select Advanced options.
Set the Disk bus to Virtio.
Set the Storage format to qcow2.
Step 9
Configure a serial console:
From the left panel, select Console.
Select Remove to remove the default console.
Click Add Hardware to add a serial device.
For Device Type, select TCP net console (tcp).
For Mode, select Server mode (bind).
For Host, enter 0.0.0.0 for the IP address and enter a unique Port number.
Check the Use Telnet box.
Configure device parameters.
Step 10
Configure a watchdog device to automatically trigger some action when the KVM guest hangs or crashes:
Click Add Hardware to add a watchdog device.
For Model, select default.
For Action, select Forcefully reset the guest.
Step 11
Configure the virtual network interface.
Choose macvtap or specify a shared device name (use a bridge name).
Note
  By default, the management center virtual instance launches with one interface, which you can then configure.
Step 12
If deploying using a Day 0 configuration file, create a virtual CD-ROM for the ISO:
Click Add Hardware.
Select Storage.
Click Select managed or other existing storage and browse to the location of the ISO file.
For Device type, select IDE CDROM.
Step 13
After configuring the virtual machine's hardware, click Apply.
Step 14
Click Begin installation for virt-manager to create the virtual machine with your specified hardware settings.
Launch Using OpenStack
You can deploy the Management Center Virtual in an OpenStack environment. OpenStack is a set of software tools for building and managing cloud computing platforms for public and private clouds, and is tightly integrated with the KVM hypervisor.
About the Day 0 Configuration File on OpenStack
OpenStack supports providing configuration data via a special configuration drive (config-drive) that is attached to the instance when it boots. To deploy the Management Center Virtual instance with Day 0 configuration using the nova boot command, include the following line:
    --config-drive true --file day0-config=/home/user/day0-config \ 
When the --config-drive command is enabled, the file =/home/user/day0-config, as found on the Linux filesystem where the nova client is invoked, is passed to the virtual machine on a virtual CDROM.

Note
While the VM may see this file with the name day0-config, OpenStack typically stores the file contents as /openstack/content/xxxx where xxxx is an assigned four-digit number (e.g. /openstack/content/0000). This may vary by OpenStack distribution.
