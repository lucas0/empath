Information About Single Sign-On
This chapter describes how to configure single sign-on (SSO) for Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN. Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN supports SSO for the following identity providers (IdPs):
Okta
Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)
PingID
Azure Active Directory (AD)

Note
For Cisco SD-WAN Manager 20.3.x release and later, use IdP SAML metadata with 2048-bit key signature certificate for SSO authentication because metadata with 1024-bit key signature certificate is not supported.
Network administrators must access different websites or applications to carry out their operations. To access these websites or applications, they must have multiple sets of credentials for each website or application. There's a possibility that they have forgotten their credentials, or someone has stolen them. With the help of the single sign-on (SSO) technique, network administrators can now have a secured access to multiple applications or websites with only one set of credentials.
For the SSO to work, we mainly require three components:
Identity provider (IdP): This system stores user data, maintains and supports the authentication mechanism, for example, Okta, ADFS, PingID, and Azure AD.
Service provider: This system hosts the website or application of interest, for example, Cisco vManage.
Users: People with a registered account with the IdP and the service provider.
To integrate IdPs with service providers, the SSO uses security assertion mark-up language (SAML). SAML is an XML-based communication standard that allows you to share identities among multiple organizations and applications.
The following steps describe the intergration of IdPs with service providers:
Whenever a network administrator tries to log in to a service provider using an IdP, the service provider first sends an encrypted message to the IdP.
The IdP decrypts the message and validates the credentials of the network administrator by comparing the information with the IdP's database.
After the validation, the IdP sends an encrypted message to the service provider. The service provider decrypts the message from the IdP, and the administrator is allowed to access the service provider.
In general, IdP and service provider exchange information based on predefined standards. This standard is a set of certificates called SAML.
After completing the above process, the administrator is redirected to the IdP portal. The administrator must enter IdP credentials to log in to Cisco SD-WAN Manager.

Note
The privileges for a particular administrator are provided based on the information available about that administrator in the IdP's database.
Benefits of Single Sign-On
Benefits of Single Sign-On
With a properly deployed SSO solution, you can do the following:
Eliminate weak passwords for each cloud application
Streamline the secured access process
Provide one-click access to cloud applications
Prerequisites for Single Sign-On
In Cisco SD-WAN Manager, ensure that the identity provider settings (Administration Settings > Identity Provider Settings) are set to Enabled.
For more information on enabling identiy provider, see Enable an Identity Provider in Cisco vManage.
Availability of SAML metadata files for configuring IdP and service provider.
Cisco SD-WAN Manager requires access to an internet connection that doesn’t have a firewall restriction for Cisco SD-WAN Manager to reach the SSO.
Configure Single Sign-On Using Okta
Okta provides a secure identity management service that lets you connect any person with any application on any device using single sign-on (SSO).

Note
Beginning with Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1, Cisco SD-WAN Manager no longer supports MD5 or SHA-1. All x.509 certificates handled by Cisco SD-WAN Manager need to use at least SHA-256 or a higher encryption algorithm.
Perform the following procedures to configure SSO.
Enable an Identity Provider in Cisco SD-WAN Manager
Configure SSO on the Okta Website
Assign Users to the Application on the Okta Website
Enable an Identity Provider in Cisco SD-WAN Manager
To configure Okta SSO, use Cisco SD-WAN Manager to enable an identity provider and generate a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) metadata file.
From Cisco vManage Release 20.10.1, you can use Add New IDP Settings to configure up to three IdPs. For more information on integrating with multiple IdPs, see the chapter Configure Multiple IdPs.
From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Administration > Settings.

Configure SSO for Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)
This section describes how to use Cisco SD-WAN Manager and ADFS to configure SSO.
The configuration of Cisco SD-WAN Manager to use ADFS as an IdP involves two steps:
Step 1 - Import ADFS metadata to Cisco SD-WAN Manager.
Step 2- Export Cisco SD-WAN Manager metadata to ADFS.
Step 2 can be further divided into:
Edit and then import Cisco SD-WAN Manager metadata to ADFS.
Set up ADFS manually using the information from the Cisco SD-WAN Manager metadata.

Note
There is no support for customized certificates for Cisco SD-WAN Manager SSO. If ADFS is configured, the signature and signing certificates are generated from the Cisco SD-WAN Manager metadata.
For more information on configuring ADFS, see Enable an Identity Provider in Cisco vManage. The steps are the same as for configuring Okta as an IdP.
Import Metadata File into ADFS
Add ADFS Relying Party Trust
Add ADFS Relying Party Trust Manually
Import Metadata File into ADFS

Note
This procedure involves a third-party website. The details are subject to change.
Step 1 - Import ADFS Metadata to Cisco SD-WAN Manager:
Download the ADFS metadata file, typically from the ADFS URL: https://<your ADFS FQDN or IP>/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml.
Save the file as adfs_metadata.txt.
From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Administration > Settings > Identity Provider Settings > Enable, and then upload adfs_metadata.txt to Cisco SD-WAN Manager.
Step 2 - Export Cisco SD-WAN Manager Metadata to ADFS:
With Identity Provider Settings enabled, Click here to download SAML metadata and save the contents to a file, which is typically 192.168.1.15_saml_metadata.xml.
After the SAML metadata is downloaded, verify that the signing certificate and the signature certificate are the same.
If the signing certificate and the signature certificate are the same, proceed to Step 6 to edit the Cisco SD-WAN Manager metadata file.
If the signing certificate and the signature certificate are not the same, use the signature certificate for the remaining steps, not the signing certificate.
Edit the Cisco SD-WAN Manager metadata file by deleting everything from <ds:Signature xmlns:ds="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#"> to </ds:Signature>.
Edit the Cisco SD-WAN Manager metadata file by deleting everything from <md:KeyDescriptor use="encryption"> to </md:KeyDescriptor>.
Import the new modified Cisco SD-WAN Manager metadata file into ADFS, and enter the entityID as Display Name.
Click Next until the end.
Open Edit Claim Rule, and add the following four new custom rules in the exact sequence:
@RuleName = "sAMAccountName as Username" c:[Type == "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/windowsaccountname", Issuer == "AD AUTHORITY"]=> issue(store = "Active Directory", types = ("Username"), query = ";sAMAccountName;{0}", param = c.Value);
@RuleName = "sAMAccountName as NameID" c:[Type == "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/windowsaccountname", Issuer == "AD AUTHORITY"] => issue(store = "Active Directory", types = ("http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier"), query = ";sAMAccountName;{0}", param = c.Value);
@RuleName = "Get User Groups and save in temp/variable" c:[Type == "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/windowsaccountname", Issuer == "AD AUTHORITY"] => add(store = "Active Directory", types = ("http://temp/variable1"), query = ";tokenGroups;{0}", param = c.Value);
@RuleName = "Parse temp/variable1 and Send Groups Membership" c:[Type == "http://temp/variable1", Value =~ "(?i)^SSO-"] => issue(Type = "Groups", Value = RegExReplace(c.Value, "SSO-", ""));
Verify the final result.
In the Active Directory, create the following two security groups: SSO-Netadmin and SSO-Operator.

Note
If you are using different naming convention for the two security groups, then you have to modify the regular expression value "(?i)^SSO-" in the step above.
Any active directory users who are not members of the two groups will only have Basic access to Cisco SD-WAN Manager.
