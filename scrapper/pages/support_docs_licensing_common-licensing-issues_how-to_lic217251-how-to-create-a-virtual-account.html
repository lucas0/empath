Introduction
This article describes the process of creating a Virtual account.
Virtual account is a subfolder in a Smart account that helps you manage your licenses, devices, services, and subscriptions. There is no limit to the number of Virtual accounts that you can have in your Smart account. However, you can have a maximum of ten subfolder layers in each Virtual account. When a Smart account is created, a default Virtual account is automatically created. Virtual accounts enable you to organize and manage your devices and licenses; grant management rights to the users within a Virtual account; control access and assign users to specific accounts; and categorize licenses and devices by your organizational needs.
Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following:
Active Cisco.com account
Smart account administrator role (To request access to a Smart account or Virtual account, refer to How to Request Access to an Existing Smart Account.)
Creating a Virtual Account
Step 1: 
Go to Cisco Software Central and log in with your Cisco.com account.
Step 2:
In the Manage Smart Account section, click Manage account.
Step 3:
On the Virtual Accounts tab, click Create Virtual Account.
Step result: The system displays the Create New Virtual Account page.
Step 4:
On the Create New Virtual Account page, on the Account Settings tab, fill in the Name field. From the Parent Account drop-down list, select whether you want to place the new Virtual account beneath an existing Virtual account that you have an access to, or place it at the top level - directly beneath the Smart account. From the Access Level drop-down list, select whether you want to keep the new Virtual account public or private.
Note: By default, the system places the new Virtual account at the top level.
Caution: If the new Virtual account is visible in commerce applications, it simplifies depositing of licenses during purchase. By setting the Access Level to Private, users cannot find this Virtual account in the search results of the Cisco Commerce Workspace. By setting the Access Level to Public, the users can find this Virtual account in the search results of Cisco Commerce Workspace.
