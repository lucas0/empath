Overview of BFD
In enterprise networks, the convergence of business-critical applications onto a common IP infrastructure is becoming more common. Given how critical data is, these networks are typically constructed with a high degree of redundancy. While such redundancy is desirable, its effectiveness is dependent upon the ability of individual network devices to quickly detect failures and reroute traffic to an alternate path. The detection times in existing protocols are typically greater than one second, and sometimes much longer. For some applications, this duration is too long to be useful. This is where Bi-directional Forwarding Detection (BFD) comes in.
BFD provides rapid failure detection times between forwarding engines, while maintaining low overhead. It also provides a single, standardized method of link/device/protocol failure detection at any protocol layer and over any media, thus enabling faster reconvergence of business-critical applications.
Benefits of Configuring BFD for Routing Protocols
Fast failure detection times for all media types, encapsulations, topologies, and routing protocols
Faster reconvergence of applications
Consistent method of failure detection
How BFD Works in Cisco SD-WAN
With the introduction of this feature, the Cisco SD-WAN solution now has two types of BFDs that are distinct features that work independently without conflict.
BFD Support for Cisco SD-WAN Routing Protocols (Legacy BFD): This feature is termed as legacy BFD because is already available for Cisco IOS XE and is being extended to the Cisco SD-WAN solution starting Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.1a.
Cisco SD-WAN BFD: This feature is specific to overlay BFD, which is an existing feature in Cisco SD-WAN.
For more information on Cisco SD-WAN BFD, see Cisco SD-WAN BFD.
Table 2. Differences: BFD for Cisco SD-WAN Routing Protocols Versus Cisco SD-WAN BFD
BFD for Cisco SD-WAN Routing Protocols
Cisco SD-WAN BFD
Runs on both, transport-side and service-side interfaces
The following protocols can be registered: BGP, OSPF, and EIGRP
BGP (transport and service side
EIGRP (service side)
OSPF and OSPFv3 (service side)
Detects link failures for peers in terms of whether a peer is up or down
Runs on a Cisco SD-WAN tunnel to detect failures in the overlay tunnel
Is enabled by default and cannot be disabled
Is typically enabled for OMP
Besides link failures, it also measures latency, loss, and other link statistics used by application-aware routing

Note
The rest of this document is specific to BFD for Routing Protocols in Cisco SD-WAN (legacy BFD).
As represented in the image, BFD is configured for a routing protocol through Cisco vManage. Cisco vManage then pushes this configuration to the edge router. In this example, let's assume that OSPF is configured to receive forwarding path detection failure messages from BFD. If there’s a physical link failure, OSPF is prompted to shut down its neighbors and restore any routing information it may have advertised to or received from its remote neighbors.
Similarly, the router, Edge 1 is connected to the internet router through its transport interface. BFD is configured for BGP between the transport side of Edge 1 and the internet router. Here, BFD detects the health of the connection and reports any failures.
Supported Protocols and Interfaces
Supported Protocols
The following routing protocols in Cisco SD-WAN can be configured to receive forwarding path detection failure messages from BFD:
BGP
EIGRP
OSPF and OSPFv3
Supported Interfaces
GigabitEthernet
TenGigabitEthernet
FiveGigabitEthernet
FortyGigabitEthernet
HundredGigabitEthernet
SVI
Subinterfaces
Limitations and Restrictions
The following restrictions apply to Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices in controller mode.
Only single-hop BFD is supported.
BFD is not supported for static routes.
To change the BFD session modes between software mode and hardware mode, you need to remove all existing BFD configuration and reconfigure it.
BFD is only supported for BGP, EIGRP, OSPF, and OSPFv3.
BFD for routing protocols in Cisco SD-WAN cannot be monitored through Cisco vManage. Use CLI show commands for monitoring BFD for Cisco SD-WAN routing protocols.
Once a BFD session is established, BFD session modes (echo to no echo, and vice-versa; or software to hardware, and vice-versa) don’t update immediately after changing the BFD template parameters in Cisco vManage. The BFD mode change takes effect only after the session flaps at least once.
Configure BFD for Routing Protocols
Cisco vManage does not provide an independent template to configure BFD for routing protocols. However, supported protocols can be registered or deregistered to received BFD packets by adding configurations using the CLI add-on template in Cisco vManage. Use the CLI add-on template to configure the following:
Add a single-hop BFD template with parameters such as timer, multiplier, session mode, and so on.
Enable the BFD template under interfaces. Only one BFD template can be added per interface.
Enable or disable BFD for the supported routing protocols. The configuration to enable or disable BFD is different for each of the supported routing protocols: BGP, EIGRP, OSPF, and OSPFv3.

From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Templates.
Click Feature Templates.

Note
In Cisco vManage Release 20.7.x and earlier releases, Feature Templates is titled Feature.
Click Add Template.
Choose a device from the device list.
Choose the CLI Add-on Template under Other Templates.
Enter the CLI configuration to add a single-hop BFD template and to enable BFD for service-BGP as shown in the following example.
bfd-template single-hop t1
 interval min-tx 500 min-rx 500 multiplier 3
 ！

    neighbor 10.20.24.17 fall-over bfd
    !
  address-family ipv6 vrf 1
    neighbor 2001::7 fall-over bfd
Understanding the CLI Configuration
In this example, a single hop BFD template is created specifying the minimum and maximum interval and the multiplier. Specifying these parameters is mandatory. In addition, you have the option to also specify other BFD parameters such as echo mode (enabled by default), and BFD dampening (off by default). Once created, the BFD template is enabled under an interface (GigabitEthernet1, in this example).

Note
To modify a BFD template enabled on an interface, you need to remove the existing template first, modify it, and then enable it on the interface again.

Note
If you attach the BFD configuration to a device template that already has a BGP feature template attached, ensure that you update the BGP configuration in the CLI add-on template to include the no neighbor ip-address ebgp-multihop command. This change is required because the neighbor ip-address ebgp-multihop command is activated on the BGP feature template by default.
Click Save.
Attach the CLI Add-on Template with this configuration to the device template.

Note
For the configuration to take effect, the device template must have a BGP feature template attached to it.
Attach the device template to the device.
Configure BFD for Transport-Side BGP
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Templates.
Click Feature Templates.

Note
In Cisco vManage Release 20.7.x and earlier releases, Feature Templates is titled Feature.
Click Add Template.
Choose a device from the device list.
Choose the CLI Add-on Template under Other Templates.
Enter the CLI configuration to add a single-hop BFD template and to enable BFD for transport-BGP as shown in the following example:

Understanding the CLI Configuration
In this example, a single hop BFD template is created specifying the minimum and maximum interval and the multiplier. Specifying these parameters is mandatory. In addition, you have the option to also specify other BFD parameters such as echo mode (enabled by default), and BFD dampening (off by default). Once created, the BFD template is enabled under an interface (GigabitEthernet1, in this example). In this example, GigabitEthernet1 is also the source of the SD-WAN tunnel. Allowing service under the tunnel interface of GigabitEthernet1 ensures that BGP and BFD packets pass over the tunnel.

Note
To modify a BFD template enabled on an interface, you need to remove the existing template first, modify it, and then enable it on the interface again.

Note
If you attach the BFD configuration to a device template that already has a BGP feature template attached, ensure that you update the BGP configuration in the CLI add-on template to include the no neighbor ip-address ebgp-multihop command. This change is required because the neighbor ip-address ebgp-multihop command is activated on the BGP feature template by default.

Issues in Pushing Device Template to Device
If you identify issues with pushing the device template to the device, collect debug logs on the edge device as shown below.
debug netconf all
request platform soft system shell
tail -f /var/log/confd/cia-netconf-trace.log
If Cisco vManage has successfully pushed the configuration to the device and the issue still persists, run the show sdwan running-config command to view all details related to BFD.
Issues with Transport-Side BFD
If the transport-side BFD session is down, check the packet filter data under the SD-WAN tunnel interface to ensure that you have allowed the BFD packets to pass through on the transport side. Look for allow-service bgp and allow-service bfd in the output.
