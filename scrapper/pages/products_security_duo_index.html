Customer stories
Sonic Automotive
"Duo was an easy choice for us. It can help us to achieve our vision of zero-trust security. The deployment was effortless and smooth. We opted for a phased roll-out starting with critical applications and expanding to all the applications and users."
-Jeff Smith, Senior Information Security Engineer, Sonic Automotive
Lyft
"Duo Beyond has enabled us to push our zero-trust strategy faster, allowing us to utilize client systems (ChromeOS to be specific) that were difficult and costly to support, making it very low effort to bring new services online and granting granular access control."
-Mike Johnson, CISO, Lyft
University of Louisville Hospital
"We are adopting a zero-trust security framework, and we know we needed MFA to start with. It was an easy choice for us. It was the first-ever security solution recommended by the users and by clinicians. This never happens in healthcare."

MFA for Companies of All Sizes
Duo has allowed us to pursue very advanced security practices, including being able to authenticate callers to our helpdesk as legitimate employees. Although uncommon of an attack vector in our space, it gives an enterprise-level of protection to businesses of ANY size.

Cisco Duo, upgrade your authentication processes, sleep at night, be awesome.
This allowed us to take one step further in our PCI compliance which required MFA for Privliged accounts. It takes its job a bit further by allowing us to geofence our users to ensure they are accessing their resources from know locations for instance within the united states. To sum it up it provides a layer of protection against external threats gaining access to our network by abusing our services that is a leap above our previous capabilities.

DUO Security: Market leader for a reason
We were regularly having users get their o365 accounts compromised via phishing attempts that we had to reactively fix via Microsoft. With MFA that number has decreased substantially to the point that we rarely have to worry about that.
