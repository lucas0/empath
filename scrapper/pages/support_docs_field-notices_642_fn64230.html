Problem Description
The NCS1K-CNTRL unit might fail after 18 months or longer in operation due to a clock signal component failure.
Background
A clock signal component manufactured by one supplier, and included in some Cisco products, has been seen to degrade over time in some units.
Although the Cisco products with these components are currently performing normally, we expect product failures to increase over the years, beginning after the unit has been in operation for approximately 18 months.
Once the component has failed, the system will stop functioning, will not boot, and is not recoverable.
To support our customers and partners, Cisco will provide replacement products for those affected products under warranty as of November 16, 2016 or currently covered by any valid hardware services contract dated July 27, 2019 or prior, which have this component.
An affected product that is not covered by a warranty or service contract is subject to Cisco’s Support Reinstatement Policy before a service contract can be purchased. An affected product that is covered by a valid hardware service contract dated after July 27, 2019 is subject to Cisco’s normal process for hardware replacement. Please see the Service and Support Descriptions for more information.
These clock signal components are used by other companies and are included in a number of Cisco products.
Customers can learn more about this topic at http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/clock-signal.html.
Problem Symptom
The product will no longer function and, subsequently, the system fails to boot.
Workaround/Solution
Customers with affected products (see the How To Identify Affected Products section) that are under warranty as of November 16, 2016 or currently covered by any valid hardware services contract dated July 27, 2019 or prior should go to the Clock Signal Component Issue page and follow the instructions in order to request replacements.
Due to the age-based nature of the failure and the volume of replacements, Cisco will prioritize orders based on the product's time in operation. Customers are reminded to return equipment promptly after replacement.
Note: There is no workaround for this issue.

How To Identify Affected Products
In order to verify if your product is affected by this issue, examine the Version ID (VID) number and/or Serial Number for the line card.
Any unit with a VID number equal to or earlier than the "Possibly Affected VID" is possibly affected.
Any devices with a VID number equal to or later than the "Fixed VID" are not affected and will not be replaced.
Any unit with a VID number equal to or earlier than the "Possibly Affected VID" is possibly affected, use the Cisco Serial Number Validation Tool in order to validate your NCS1K-CNTLR serial number(s).
The serial numbers for the affected devices should be included in the Replacement Product Order Spreadsheet. Cisco will determine if they are eligible for replacement.
