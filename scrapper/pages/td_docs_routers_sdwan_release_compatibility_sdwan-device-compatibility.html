Cisco SD-WAN Device Compatibility
The tables that follow describe devices compatible with Cisco SD-WAN, and indicate the minimum software version required for support.

Note
On Cisco vEdge devices, downgrade is not supported completely. When you upgrade to a newer version and then revert to an older version, the downgrade is successful as it uses the original config database. However, when you try to downgrade to a different version, the downgrade may fail as the older version is not compatible to the new config database.
For example, when there is a node running on 20.3.2 version and is upgraded to 20.6.1 and if you want to go back to 20.3.2 version, it is successful. But, if you want to downgrade to 20.3.1 version or any versions other than 20.3.2, it may fail.
