Chapter Contents
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN includes the following types of Network Address Translation (NAT) configuration:
NAT Direct Internet Access (DIA): Allows remote sites to route traffic directly to the internet rather than routing the traffic to a central site or data center.
NAT service-side: Allows you to configure inside and outside NAT on data traffic traveling to and from the service hosts of the network overlay. Service-side NAT translates data traffic, of inside and outside host addresses, that match a configured centralized data policy.
NAT is designed for IP address conservation. NAT enables private IP networks that use nonregistered IP addresses to connect to the internet. NAT operates on a device, usually connecting two networks. Before packets are forwarded onto another network, NAT translates the private (not globally unique) addresses in the internal network into legal addresses.
NAT allows a single device to act as an agent between the internet (or public network) and a local network (or private network), which means that only a single unique IP address is required to represent an entire group of computers to anything outside their network.

Note
When NAT performs maintenance operations, it needs to lock the NAT database. When the NAT database is locked, NAT does not process any packets for translations. Typically, NAT maintenance operations are less than a second to a few seconds. Usually, NAT sending out untranslated packets is not an issue because these packets are dropped by an ISP.
Configure the following command to ensure that NAT drops packets when performing NAT database updates:
ip nat service modify-in-progress drop

Information About NAT DIA
NAT DIA allows branch sites to route traffic directly to the internet rather than having to go through a central site to be inspected. This allows cloud-based applications to go directly to the internet and to cloud-service providers without having to use unnecessary bandwidth.
NAT DIA Flow-Stickiness
Minimum supported releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.1a, Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1
When NAT DIA is configured with centralized data policy with application match, the application flows subject to NAT DIA policy may get reset due to path change. For example, when you have a data policy matching an application list and the action is NAT DIA, the first few packets may not be identified by deep packet inspection (DPI). So, the packets not matching NAT DIA application policy follow routing to the Cisco SD-WAN overlay path. When the flow is identified, the later packets of the flow will take the NAT DIA path as defined by the data policy. This path change results in a flow reset as different paths means different client source or port combination towards the server and the server resets the unknown TCP flows.
The Flow-Stickiness feature is enabled to record the flow level state of the NAT path. If the first packet of the flow is non-NAT, it keeps the rest of the packets of this flow to non-NAT paths. If the first packet flow is via the NAT DIA path, it keeps the rest of the packets of this flow to the NAT DIA path. It is enabled by default with NAT DIA data policy.
To disable flow stickiness, use the command flow-stickiness-disable under the localized policy using CLI add-on template.

Advertise NAT Routes Through OMP
The following sections provide information about advertising NAT routes through OMP.
Information About Advertising NAT Routes Through OMP
Enable NAT Route Advertisements Through OMP Using the CLI
Verify NAT Route Advertisements Through OMP Using the CLI
Information About Advertising NAT Routes Through OMP
Starting from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.5.1a, you can configure NAT DIA default routes to be advertised through OMP. OMP is enabled by default on all Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices, and so, there is no need to explicitly configure or enable OMP. OMP must be operational for the overlay network to function. If you disable OMP, you disable the overlay network.
When NAT DIA advertisement is configured on any designated Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device on the network, OMP advertises the NAT default route to the branches. The branches receive the default route and use it to reach the hub for all DIA traffic. The Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device acts as the internet gateway for all DIA traffic.
Figure 1. Advertising NAT Routes Using OMP
Enable NAT Route Advertisements Through OMP Using the CLI
To advertise the default route over OMP, use the sdwan omp command.
Use the following configuration to advertise NAT routes through OMP.

Note
This command has been tested using only the device CLI template.
ip nat route vrf 1 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 global

Restrictions for NAT DIA IPv4 over an IPv6 Tunnel
NAT DIA tracker is not supported.
Unified Threat Defense (UTD) is not supported.
Keepalive traffic on a tunnel interface is not supported.
Use Case for NAT DIA IPv4 over an IPv6 Tunnel
A customer has an IPv6-only device, but requires access to IPv4 websites and services. To support this scenario, use an IPv6 tunnel for directing the IPv4 traffic to the internet.
Figure 2. NAT DIA IPv4 over IPv6 Tunnel Support
Minimum supported release: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.11.1a and Cisco vManage Release 20.11.1
The border router acts as a gateway between IPv6 and IPv4 traffic to send IPv4 bound traffic through static IPv6 tunnel. When the border router and the IPv6 tunnel is unreachable, the WAN edge device cannot determine if the IPv6 tunnel is inactive and therefore cannot re-route the traffic.
Associating IPv4 DIA tracker to an IPv6 tunnel and the border router, helps the WAN edge device to determine if the IPv6 tunnel is active based on the tracker status. When IPv4 tracker is inactive, the associated IPv6 tunnel is also inactive and the traffic is re-routed to an alternative path based on the routing table. When the IPv4 tracker is active, the associated IPv6 tunnel is also active and the traffic is resumed back to the IPv6 tunnel.

Minimum supported releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.9.1a, Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1
This feature provides support for Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) dialer interfaces for the NAT DIA use case. Use dialer interfaces to access IPv4 internet services and sites.
A dialer interface specifies how to handle traffic from clients, including default routing information, the encapsulation protocol, and the dialer pool to use.
The following dialer interfaces are supported:
Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE)
Point-to-Point Protocol over Asynchronous Transfer Mode (PPPoA)
Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet over Asynchronous Transfer Mode (PPPoEoA)
For more information on configuring PPPoE, see the Configuring PPPoE section in the Cisco SD-WAN Systems and Interfaces Guide, Cisco IOS XE Release 17.x.
Adjust the TCP Maximum Segment Size for NAT DIA

Note
Beginning with Cisco IOS XE Release 17.9.1a and Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1, you can adjust the TCP maximum segment size (MSS) value for preventing dropped TCP sessions.
For more information on configuring TCP MSS, see the Configure TCP MSS and Clear Dont Fragment section in the Cisco SD-WAN Systems and Interfaces Guide, Cisco IOS XE Release 17.x.

NAT DIA Static NAT Mapping with HSRP
The following sections provide information about configuring NAT DIA static NAT mapping with HSRP.
Information About Static NAT Mapping with HSRP
Restrictions for Static NAT Mapping with HSRP
Configure Static NAT Mapping with HSRP Using a CLI Template
Verify Static NAT Mapping with HSRP
Information About Static NAT Mapping with HSRP
Minimum supported releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.9.1a, Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1
HSRP is a first-hop redundancy protocol (FHRP) designed to allow transparent failover of the first-hop IP device. HSRP provides high availability by providing first-hop routing redundancy for IP hosts on networks configured with a default gateway IP address. HSRP is used for identifying an active and standby device in a group of routers.
For more information on HSRP configuration, see the "Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP)" chapter of the Cisco SD-WAN Systems and Interfaces Configuration Guide, Cisco IOS XE Release 17.x.
Address Resolution with ARP
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) finds the hardware address, also known as a Media Access Control (MAC) address, of a host from its known IP address. ARP maintains a cache table in which MAC addresses are mapped to IP addresses.
Gratuitous ARP
When a host sends an ARP request to resolve its own IP address, it is called gratuitous ARP. In the ARP request packet, the source and destination IP addresses are filled with the same source IP address itself. The destination MAC address is the Ethernet broadcast address.
When a router becomes active, it broadcasts a gratuitous ARP packet with the HSRP virtual MAC address to the affected LAN segment. If the segment uses an Ethernet switch, this allows the switch to change the location of the virtual MAC address so that packets flow to the active router instead of the one that is no longer active. End devices do not need gratuitous ARP if routers use the default HSRP MAC address.
Static NAT Mapping with HSRP
When an ARP query is triggered for an address that is configured with NAT static mapping and owned by the device, NAT responds with the virtual MAC address configured for this HSRP group. Two devices act as the HSRP active and standby. Configure the NAT inside interfaces of the active and standby devices to belong to an HSRP group.
When both the active and standby routers are configured with the same static NAT mapping, only the active device responds to the ARP request for a static NAT mapping entry. Traffic that fails over from the HSRP active device to the standby device does not have to wait for the ARP request to time out before failing over.
The new HSRP active device automatically resumes the ownership of the static NAT mapping entry without waiting for the ARP request to time out. The HSRP active device also sends out a gratuitous ARP request for the static NAT mapping entry. This is done by leveraging the HSRP group name that is mapped to the ip nat outside source static command.
For more information on static NAT mapping with HSRP, see the IP Addressing: NAT Configuration Guide.

The redundancy keyword is supported for the ip nat outside source static command only. The redundancy keyword is not supported for the ip nat inside source static command.
Configure both the HSRP active router and the standby router with the same HSRP group name and the same static NAT mapping.
Configure the ip nat inside command for translating the source IP in addition to configuring the ip nat outside command for destination NAT.
When you send a packet from the service side to the internet, NAT DIA translates the destination IP address, which can also be a private IP address, to a public IP address. This is known as destination NAT.
Configure a centralized data policy to support ip nat outside functionality. The traffic bound for destination NAT may not fall under the policy sequence.

Minimum supported releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.9.1a, Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1
An application-level gateway (ALG), also known as an application-layer gateway, is an application that translates the IP address inside the payload of an application packet. You use an ALG to interpret the application-layer protocol and perform firewall and NAT translations.
Specific protocols that embed the IP address information within the packet payload require the support of an ALG. The following protocols require an ALG for NAT translations of the application payload:
Domain Network System (DNS)
File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
SIP adds the ability to deploy NAT on VoIP solutions based on SIP.
Starting with Cisco vManage Release 20.11.1 and Cisco IOS XE Release 17.11.1a, following protocols are supported:
Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)
Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)
Sun Remote Procedure Call (SUNRPC)
Skinny Client Control Protocol (SCCP)
H.323

Note
If a zone-based firewall (ZBFW) is enabled for NAT DIA, the NAT ALG feature interoperates with the ZBFW.
For more information on ALGs, see the IP Addressing: NAT Configuration Guide.
Benefits of Using ALGs with NAT DIA
Benefits of Using ALGs with NAT DIA
Allows client applications to use dynamic TCP or UDP ports to communicate with the server application.
Supports interoperability between NAT ALGs configured with NAT DIA and a zone-based firewall (ZBFW).
Restrictions for Using ALGs with NAT DIA
Minimum supported releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.9.1a, Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1
No support for ALGs with service-side NAT. Only NAT DIA is supported.
No support for configuring an ALG using the ip nat outside source command.
A Domain Name System (DNS) ALG requires a static entry in a NAT translation table to modify the payload. If there is no static entry in the NAT translation table, DNS ALG does not work.
Use the following command to create a static entry in a NAT translation table:
ip nat inside source static local-ip global-ip vrf vrf-id egress-interface interface-type-number
If you run the clear ip nat translations command, the ALG session is cleared. To recreate translations by NAT, run new NAT commands. This is the expected behavior.

Minimum supported releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.9.1a, Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1
Port forwarding with NAT DIA provides users who run servers within a private network the ability to share a public IP address and a port number that maps to an inside local IP address and port number. This feature can forward different ports to different internal IP addresses, allowing multiple servers to be accessible from the same public IP address.
Prior to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.9.1a and Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1, port forwarding was available only for service-side NAT.
Figure 4. NAT DIA Port Forwarding with a Port Change
From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.11.1a and later releases, you can configure loopback interfaces for port forwarding with NAT DIA. Loopback interfaces ensure that the IP address assigned to the interface is always reachable if the IP routing protocols continue to advertise the subnet that is assigned to the loopback interface. After the loopback interface and the port number are configured, the source IP address and the source port number are translated to the loopback IP address and port number respectively.
From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.11.1a, you can configure loopback interfaces by either using device CLI templates or CLI add-on feature templates. For more information about configuring the loopback interface, see Configure Port Forwarding with NAT DIA Using a CLI Template.

No support for dialer virtual interfaces.
UDP ports 8000-48199 are reserved for VoIP traffic. If VoIP is enabled on a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device, NAT DIA canâ€™t use the same UDP ports that are reserved for VoIP traffic.
NAT DIA port forwarding for a TLOC egress interface doesnâ€™t support fragmented packets sourced from outside the network.
Define up to 128 port-forwarding rules to allow requests from an external network to reach devices on the internal network.
An IP address plus a port number to an IP address plus a port number translation is supported using Cisco vManage feature templates and CLI templates.
Interface port forwarding is supported using a CLI template only.
When you use an interface rather than an IP address in your port-forwarding rule, this is known as interface port forwarding.

Port forwarding with NAT DIA using a loopback interface
From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.11.1a, you can configure loopback interfaces for port forwarding with NAT DIA. While configuring a loopback interface, provide the egress interface, which is the internet-facing interface.
Here is a configuration example for configuring port forwarding with NAT DIA by using a loopback interface.
Configure ip nat outside on the WAN interface:
interface GigabitEthernet1
 ip address 10.1.2.1 255.255.255.0
 ip nat outside
 negotiation auto
 no mop enabled
 no mop sysid
exit
Define the loopback interface:
interface Loopback3
 ip address 10.1.3.1 255.255.255.255
exit
Configure the loopback interface:
ip nat inside source static tcp 192.168.1.100 8080 interface Loopback3 8585 vrf 1 egress-interface GigabitEthernet1
ip nat inside source static tcp 192.168.1.100 80 interface Loopback3 5050 egress-interface GigabitEthernet1 
In the preceding configuration example, the incoming TCP packet with the source IP address of 192.168.1.100 is translated to the IP address assigned to Loopback3, which is 10.1.3.1. The source port 8080 is translated to 8585.
If you specify a VRF number in the range of 1â€“512, port forwarding occurs within the service VPN. When you donâ€™t specify a value for the VRF number, port forwarding is configured on the transport VPN, which is VPN 0, by default.
The loopback interface remains active till you run the shutdown command in the interface configuration mode.

NAT HSL lets you enable or disable NAT high-speed logging for virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) instances. When HSL is configured, NAT provides a log of the packets flowing through the routing devices (similar to the Version 9 NetFlow-like records) to an external collector. NAT translations exported to an external collector can include service-side VRF to global DIA and intra-service VRF (service-side VRF NAT) translations. When sessions are created and deleted, records are generated for each binding (binding is the address binding the local address and the global address to which the local address is translated).
You can turn on the collector for viewing the HSL information for NAT. You can turn on HSL only when required, and HSL log records are created and sent to the collector accordingly. This saves CPU cycles and bandwidth by not creating and sending HSL logging records when not needed.
Benefits of NAT HSL
Benefits of NAT HSL
Supports the sending of flow monitor records for NAT operations to an external collector.
Enables creation and sending of HSL records only when required, which saves CPU cycles and bandwidth.
Sends an HSL message automatically when a NAT pool runs out of addresses (also referred to as pool exhaustion).

Service-side NAT VRF does not support IPv6 addresses.
Export of an IPv6 target in a service-side VRF is not supported.
Export of translations using IPv6 in a VRF is not supported.
Prerequisites for NAT HSL
Ensure that the NAT translations are available on the router.
Confirm that the log messages are being generated.
Best Practices for NAT HSL
Verify that the configured IP address and port address for logging are as per the configurations in the collector.
Use the show interface statistics command to verify the output packet counters and confirm the flow of packets from the router interface connecting to the collector.
Configure NAT HSL Using a CLI Template
For more information about using CLI templates, see CLI Add-On Feature Templates and CLI Templates.

Note
By default, CLI templates execute commands in global configuration mode.
The following is a sample CLI configuration to enable the high-speed logging of translations by NAT using a flow exporter:
ip nat log translations flow-export v9 udp destination IPv4address-port source interface-name interface-number 
The following is a configuration example to enable translation logging for a specific destination and source interface:
ip nat log translations flow-export v9 udp destination 10.10.0.1 1020 source gigabithethernet 0/0/1
Verify NAT HSL Configuration
The following is a sample output from the show ip nat translations command. You can view the translations log in the export target collector.

Information About Source Port Preservation for the Well-Known SD-WAN Ports
SD-WAN deployment uses UDP port number ranging 12346 to 12445 and TCP ports ranging 23456 to 24356 for control connections on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. When an external Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device is behind the firewall during NAT, the control traffic port can translate to a different port. This is normally not an issue but when BFD sessions go down, NAT translates the new BFD control packet to a different port. The firewall doesn't accept the newly translated port and drops BFD packets as it has saved translated port of the older BFD session.
With this feature, you can configure Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices to preserve the source ports for the known SD-WAN ports during NAT. There is a set of reserved ports for the control traffic and within this range the ports are preserved during NAT. On enabling this feature, Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device preserves the source port from the known SD-WAN port range. Thus, firewall can handle SD-WAN devices behind NAT.

Note
Ensure that no service side traffic uses these port ranges, else it results in control connections failure.
Enabling the feature allows source port preservation for control traffic using SD-WAN known ports for the following NAT mapping conditions:
Interface overload
Loopback overload
Figure 6. Topology of Source Port Preservation in SD-WAN Deployment
The topology depicts a dual router site. cE1 has tloc-extension configured to use cE2 for INET connectivity to reach controllers. cE1 is using the known SD-WAN port 12346, when the packet reaches cE2. The NAT functionality on cE2 preserves this source port number 12346 and doesn't change it before sending the packets out.
Features of Source Port Preservation
The traffic with the specified port within the reserved port range is translated to the same port after configuring ip nat settings preserve-sdwan-ports command.
As the locally generated traffic does not go through NAT, they always get port preservation in the reserved port range. If a local and an external device are using the same port in the reserved port range, the local traffic gets the preference.
Reserved ports for UDP are in the range 12346â€”12426, and for TCP reserved port range is 23456â€”24356.
TLS (TCP) control connections can take port value > 1024. As source port preservation is only supported for the reserved port range 23456â€”24356 for TCP, any other port value may not be preserved after translation.
Prerequisites for Source Port Preservation
If there are existing NAT mapping configurations, ensure that you reboot the device after configuring the ip nat settings preserve-sdwan-ports command to achieve the expected behavior. If not, add NAT mapping configurations after configuring the ip nat settings preserve-sdwan-ports command.
Restrictions for Source Port Preservation
Service-side traffic cannot use the reserved port range.
If the SD-WAN well-known port is already allocated for a flow and another flow requests translation for the same port, then the packets for the new flows are dropped.
If there are existing NAT mapping configurations, reboot the device after executing the ip nat settings preserve-sdwan-ports command to achieve the expected behavior. If not, add the NAT mapping configurations after executing the ip nat settings preserve-sdwan-ports command.

Information about Destination NAT
Minimum supported releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.11.1a and Cisco vManage Release 20.11.1
When you send a packet from the service side to the internet, NAT Direct Internet Access (DIA) translates the destination IP address, which can also be a private IP address, to a public IP address. This is known as destination NAT.
Any WAN edge device situated between two endpoints can be used to perform destination NAT. Destination NAT is used to redirect incoming packets with the destination of a private IP address to a public IP address. It is generally used to redirect packets destined for a specific IP address on one host to a different address on a different host.
Restrictions for Destination NAT
Minimum supported releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.11.1a and Cisco vManage Release 20.11.1
Only NAT DIA is supported with destination NAT.
Only traffic originating from inside to outside direction is supported.
Only data-policy-based DIA is supported.
Does not support route-based DIA configurations.
Does not support port forwarding with NAT DIA.
Same NAT rules for packets are not applicable on different VRFs.
Use Case for Destination NAT
Minimum supported releases: Cisco IOS XE Release 17.11.1a and Cisco vManage Release 20.11.1
A customer device using a Cisco VPN client initiates a DNS query to the device operating the firewall service, which is assigned with a private IP address. This private IP address is the overlay IP address. In case NAT DIA is not configured, the data policy uses VPN 0 fallback to the overlay to send the traffic to the firewall with the private IP address. The overlay IP address, which is a private IP address, is translated to a public IP address.
The prefered path for the traffic route is through the path with NAT DIA configured, where both the source and the destination IP addresses are translated.

Description
NAT DIA Tracker for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1
This feature allows you to configure a system tracker to probe the transport interface periodically to determine if the internet or external network becomes unavailable.
You can configure the DIA tracker using the Tracker tab of the Cisco System template.
You can apply the tracker to a transport interface using either the Cisco VPN Interface Ethernet or the Cisco VPN Interface Cellular template.
Dual Endpoint Support for Interface Status Tracking on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1
This feature allows you to configure tracker groups with dual endpoints using the Cisco vManage system template and associate each tracker group to an interface. Despite having an active Internet connection, a single endpoint may sometimes be inactive. This condition leads to false negatives. To overcome this disadvantage of a single endpoint tracker, you can use a dual endpoint tracker configuration.
NAT DIA Tracker for IPv6 Interface
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.11.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.11.1
NAT DIA tracker is now supported on IPv6 interfaces.
You can configure IPv6 DIA tracker using the IPv6-Tracker and IPv6-Tracker Group options under transport profile in configuration groups.

Information About NAT DIA Tracking
The DIA tracker helps determine if the internet or external network has become unavailable. The NAT DIA Tracking feature is useful when NAT is enabled on a transport interface in VPN 0 to allow data traffic from the router to exit directly to the internet.
Fore more information on NAT DIA, see NAT Direct Internet Access.
If the internet or external network becomes unavailable, the router continues to forward traffic based on the NAT route in the service VPN. Traffic that is forwarded to the internet gets dropped. To prevent the internet-bound traffic from being dropped, configure the DIA tracker on the edge router to track the status of the transport interface. The tracker periodically probes the interface to determine the status of the internet and return the data to the attach points that are associated with the tracker.
When the tracker is configured on the transport interface, the interface IP address is used as a source IP address for probe packets.
IP SLA monitors the status of probes and measures the round-trip time of these probe packets and compares the values with the configured latency in the probe. When the latency exceeds the configured threshold value, the tracker considers the network as unavailable.
If the tracker determines that the local internet is unavailable, the router withdraws the NAT route from Service VPN, and reroutes the traffic based on the local routing configuration, to overlay.
The local router continues to periodically check the status of the path to the interface. When it detects that the path is functioning again, the router reinstalls the NAT route to the internet.
From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.7.1a, you can configure a tracker group with two trackers, and associate this tracker group to an interface. Probing a tracker group with two trackers (two endpoints) helps in avoiding false negatives that might be introduced when an internal or external network gets erroneously marked as unavailable.
From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.11.1a, you can configure NAT DIA tracker on IPv6 interfaces. The tracker and tracker group address type should match IPv4 or IPv6 address types on the interface configuration. For example, if an IPv4 address is configured on a NAT DIA interface, only an IPv4 tracker can be applied. If an IPv6 address is configured on a NAT DIA interface, only an IPv6 tracker can be applied. If both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are configured on a NAT DIA interface, both IPv4 and IPv6 tracker can be applied correspondingly.
Supported Interfaces for NAT DIA Tracker
You can configure the NAT DIA tracker for the following interfaces:
Cellular Interfaces
Ethernet Interfaces
Ethernet (PPPoE) Interfaces
Subinterfaces
DSL Dialer Interfaces (PPPoE and PPPoA)

Note

Table 6. Tracker Parameters
Parameter Field
Description
Name
Name of the tracker. The name can be up to 128 alphanumeric characters. You can configure up to eight trackers.
Threshold
Duration to wait for the probe to return a response before declaring that the transport interface is down. Range: 100 to 1000 milliseconds. Default: 300 milliseconds
Interval
Frequency at which a probe is sent to determine the status of the transport interface. Range: 20 to 600 seconds. Default: 60 seconds (1 minute)
Multiplier
Number of times a probe can be resent before declaring that the transport interface is down. Range: 1 to 10. Default: 3
Tracker Type
Choose Interface to configure the DIA tracker.
End Point Type: IP Address
IP address of the end point. This is the destination in the internet to which the router sends probes to determine the status of the transport interface. Make sure that the IP address is enabled to respond to HTTP port 80 probes.
End Point Type: DNS Name
DNS name of the end point. This is the destination in the internet to which the router sends probes to determine the status of the transport interface.
Click Add.

Table 7. Tracker Group Parameters
Parameter Field
Description
Tracker Type: Tracker Elements
This field is displayed only if you chose Tracker Type as the Tracker Group. Add the existing interface tracker names (separated by a space). When you add this tracker to the template, the tracker group is associated with these individual trackers, and you can then associate the tracker group to an interface.
Tracker Type: Tracker Boolean
This field is displayed only if you chose Tracker Type as the Tracker Group. Select AND or OR.
OR is the default boolean operation. An OR ensures that the transport interface status is reported as active if either one of the associated trackers of the tracker group reports that the interface is active.
If you select the AND operation, the transport-interface status is reported as active if both the associated trackers of the tracker group, report that the interface is active.

Note
Ensure that you have configured two single endpoint trackers before configuring a tracker group.
Click Add.
Click Advanced and enter the Track Interface information.
Enter the name of the tracker to track the status of transport interfaces that connect to the internet.

Note
Tracking the interface status is useful when you enable NAT in a transport interface in VPN 0 to allow data traffic from the router to exit directly to the internet rather than having to first go to a router in a data center. In this situation, enabling NAT in the transport interface splits the TLOC between the local router and the data center into two, with one going to the remote router and the other going to the internet. When you enable transport tunnel tracking, the software periodically probes the path to the internet to determine whether it is up. If the software detects that this path is down, it withdraws the route to the internet destination, and traffic destined to the internet is then routed through the data center router. When the software detects that the path to the internet is functioning again, the route to the internet is reinstalled.

Note
Ensure that you complete filling all the mandatory fields before you update the template.
Click Update.

Information About Service-Side NAT
On a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device, you can configure NAT on the service-side of the device so that data traffic is NATed before entering the overlay tunnel that is located in the transport VPN. The service-side NAT masks the IP address of data traffic it receives.
You can configure both dynamic and 1:1 static NAT on the service-side of a device. To do this, you configure a NAT pool interface within a service VPN on the device, and then you configure a centralized data policy on the Cisco vSmart Controller. The policy directs data traffic with the desired prefixes to the service-side NAT. You configure either dynamic NAT or static NAT on the desired NAT pool interface.
When service-side NAT is enabled, all matching prefixes in VPN 1 are directed to the NAT pool interface. This traffic is NATed, with the NAT swapping out the service-side IP address and replacing it with its NAT pool IP address. The packet then gets forwarded to its destination.
You can configure NAT for data that enters or exits the service-side of the network. The service-side NAT translates data traffic, of inside and outside host addresses, that match a configured centralized data policy.
Inside Source Address Translation
When service-side or LAN-side hosts send traffic to remote branches, the inside address translation services allow the source IP address (inside host) translation. This translation occurs before the data traffic is sent out to the overlay tunnels. The NAT inside pool and the inside static NAT addresses are redistributed to the overlay. These addresses are advertised to all the remote branches using the Overlay Management Protocol (OMP). Thus, the remote host is aware of the path to reach inside hosts.
For inside-address translation, the data traffic from service-side is matched with the centralized data policy match condition for dynamic NAT. If the source IP address satisfies the match condition, the data traverses the NAT configured on the service VPN before entering the remote edge router through the overlay. Address translation occurs on the tunnel egress interface. In releases before Cisco IOS XE Release 17.4.1a and earlier up to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.1a, the static-inside NAT does not need a match condition in a centralized data policy. The static translation occurs if the source IP address matches the configured IP address for static NAT.
Starting from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.5.1a, you can map static NAT to a pool and static NAT is applied to the traffic if there is a data policy match.
Outside Source Address Translation
When the traffic from a remote site traverses through the overlay tunnels, the outside address translation service translates the remote host source IP address (outside host). The translation occurs before the traffic is sent to the LAN (VPN) side of the network. If route redistribution is configured, the NAT outside pool address or routes are redistributed to the LAN side of the network through Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) or other protocols. Thus, the inside host is aware of the path to reach remote hosts.
In releases before Cisco IOS XE Release 17.4.1a and earlier up to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.1a, both inside and outside service-side NAT must be a dynamic NAT configuration. You can also configure 1:1 static NAT mapping for both inside and outside address translation.
Starting from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.5.1a, you can configure a NAT pool action for static NAT as well, using a centralized data policy.

Note
Configure dynamic NAT before you configure static NAT.
Data Policy for Service-Side NAT
To enable NAT on the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices, configure a centralized data policy for static and dynamic NAT. A data policy provides the match criteria and NAT pool action for dynamic NAT.
Starting from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.5.1a, you can create a data policy to configure match criteria and a NAT pool action for static NAT.
Benefits of Service-Side NAT
Benefits of Service-Side NAT
Provides translation of source IPv4 addresses to destination IPv4 addresses
Maps a public IPv4 address to a private source IPv4 address
Provides a way for service providers to implement a seamless transition to IPv6
Traffic Flows for Service-Side NAT
The following are the two data traffic flows for service-side NAT:
Source translation for traffic from service-side of the network destined to the remote edge through the overlay network
Source translation for traffic destined to the service-side of the network from the remote edge through the overlay network
NAT Feature Invocation Array (FIA) from service-sideâ€”When the traffic is from the service-VPN that is destined to the remote edge through the tunnel, NAT FIA is enabled on the egress interface, which is the tunnel interface. The data policy direction is configured as from-service.
NAT FIA from-tunnelâ€”When the traffic is from the remote edge that comes through the tunnel and reaches the service VPN, NAT FIA is enabled on the egress interface, which is the service VPN LAN interface. The data policy direction is configured as from-tunnel.
When the data policy direction is configured as all (all directions), NAT FIA is enabled on service VPN interfaces and tunnel interfaces.

Note
The IP addresses of a centralized data policy and static NAT source IP address must not overlap in Cisco IOS XE Release 17.4.1a and earlier releases up to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.1a. The centralized data policy must be clearly defined so that there are no overlapping traffic match conditions.
Restrictions for Service-Side NAT
Only NAT pool translations are supported.
Translations between different VRFs are not supported.
In Cisco vManage, you can configure a maximum of 32 pools.
Specify the NAT pool name as natpool natpool-number , where natpool-number must match the NAT pool value specified in the data policy.
Example: natpool10
In Cisco IOS XE Release 17.4.1a, Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.1a, and Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.2, a static NAT address must not be shared in pool addresses.
Starting from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.5.1a, the static NAT address may belong to the configured NAT pool address list, if it is used along with a data policy.
A data policy and dynamic NAT pool must be defined for static NAT for a VRF.
IPv4 translations for NAT64 are not supported.
Each service VPN must have a unique NAT pool number.
NAT entries cannot be edited after they are first created.
Configure Service-Side NAT
Workflow for Configuring Service-Side NAT
Configure a centralized data policy for the Cisco vSmart Controller to include a NAT pool number and action. The direction of the centralized data policy for NAT inside must be from-service. The direction of the policy for NAT outside must be from-tunnel.
Configure a dynamic NAT pool number using a Cisco VPN template, which is a service-side VPN.
Configure dynamic NAT mappings using a Cisco VPN template.
(Optional) Configure a static NAT mapping using a Cisco VPN template.
Starting from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.5.1a, you can configure a NAT pool for static NAT and create a data policy to provide match criteria and a NAT pool action for static NAT.
For more information on configuring service-side static NAT, see Configure Service-Side Static NAT.
For NAT inside, the NAT pool subnet and static NAT translation of IP addresses are automatically advertised into OMP. For NAT outside, you can manually configure redistribution of the NAT pool subnet and static NAT translation of IPv4 addresses to the service-side protocols.

Note
If the data policy action is configured for VPN 0, the action is configured for DIA traffic. If the data policy action is configured for any of the service VPNs (example: VPN 1), which includes a NAT pool configuration, the action is for service-side NAT.

Note
Starting from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.3.1a, the ip nat settings central-policy command is required for NAT on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices to work in Cisco SD-WAN mode. If you use a Cisco vManage feature template to enable NAT on the device, Cisco vManage automatically pushes this command to the device. However, if you are using a device CLI template only to configure NAT on the device, you need to add the ip nat settings central-policy command to the device CLI template configuration.

Information About Intra-VPN Service-Side NAT
Intra-VPN service-side NAT is an extension to service-side NAT, which allows a service-side LAN interface to communicate with another service-side LAN interface within the same VPN. Intra-VPN service-side NAT uses static or dynamic NAT so that data traffic can be initiated in either direction. You can apply static or dynamic NAT rules for packets to be routed from other LAN interfaces to the interface configured as the outside interface using the ip nat outside command.
You configure intra-VPN service-side NAT using a device CLI template or a CLI add-on template.
You can configure port forwarding for intra-VPN service-side NAT.
For more information on configuring port forwarding for intra-VPN service-side NAT, see Configure Service-Side Port Forwarding for NAT.

Description
Service-Side NAT Object Tracker Support
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.8.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.8.1
This feature adds support for tracking LAN prefixes and LAN interfaces for service-side inside static NAT.
When the object tracker that is associated with a NAT route changes state (up or down), the NAT OMP route is added or removed from the routing table. You can view notifications in Cisco vManage for monitoring the NAT routes and interfaces that are added or removed.
You can configure the service-side NAT object tracker using Cisco vManage, a device CLI template, or a CLI add-on template.

Information About Service-Side NAT Object Tracker
The service-side NAT object tracker provides support for tracking the following:
LAN prefixes: Tracks the prefixes in the Route Information Base (RIB) of a routing table.

Note
If a prefix is missing in the routing table, the service-side NAT object tracker removes the OMP route of the NAT prefix.
LAN interfaces: Tracks whether the LAN interface is up or down.
Each tracked object is identified by a unique number that is specified in Cisco vManage, a device CLI, or a CLI add-on template. Client processes use this number to track a specific object.
The tracking process periodically polls the tracked objects and notes changes in values, if any. The changes in the tracked object are communicated to interested client processes, either immediately or after a specified delay. The object values are reported as either up or down.
Depending on the state of the LAN prefix or LAN interface, NAT route advertisements through OMP are either added or removed. You can view event logs in Cisco vManage for monitoring which NAT route advertisements are added or removed.
For more information on monitoring object tracker event logs in Cisco vManage, see Monitor Service-Side NAT Object Tracker.
You can configure the service-side NAT object tracker using Cisco vManage, a device CLI, or a CLI add-on template.
A track keyword is added to the ip nat inside source command.
For more information on the track keyword, see the ip nat inside source command in the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Qualified Command Reference.
Benefits of Service-Side NAT Object Tracker
Benefits of Service-Side NAT Object Tracker
Adds or removes NAT route advertisements through OMP, based on the state of the object tracker.
Provides Cisco vManage event log notifications for monitoring the NAT route advertisements that are added or removed.

Configure the inside static NAT with a tracker name and a tracker ID:
Device(config)# ip nat inside source static 192.168.11.10 10.11.11.10 vrf 1 
match-in-vrf track 1
Configure an inside static NAT pool with a prefix length:
Device(config)# ip nat pool natpool2 10.11.11.0 10.11.11.25 prefix-length 27 
Configure an inside static NAT global pool with overload mode, a tracker name, and a tracker ID:
Device(config)# ip nat inside source list global-list pool natpool2 vrf 1 match-in-vrf overload track 1
Track the reachability of an IP route:
Device(config)# track 1 ip route 192.168.11.0 255.255.255.0 reachability
Device(config-track)# ip vrf 1

Note
A tracked object is considered to be up when a routing table entry exists for the route, and the route is accessible.
Track the line-protocol state of an interface:
Device(confige)# track 1 interface GigabitEthernet5.101 line-protocol

Verify the Service-Side NAT Object Tracker Configuration
The following sections provide information on verifying the service-side NAT object tracker configuration.
Verify the State of the Service-Side NAT Object Tracker
The following is a sample output from the show track object-id command:
Device# show track 1
 Track 1
  Interface GigabitEthernet5.101 line-protocol
  Line protocol is Up
    1 change, last change 01:38:57
  Tracked by:
    NAT 0
In this output, Line protocol is Up (OMP), indicates that the service-side object tracker is up.
Verify that NAT Routes Through OMP are Added to the Routing Table
The following is a sample output from the show ip route vrf command:
Device# show ip route vrf 1
Routing Table: 1
Codes: L - local, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP
       D - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter area
       N1 - OSPF NSSA external type 1, N2 - OSPF NSSA external type 2
       E1 - OSPF external type 1, E2 - OSPF external type 2, m - OMP
       n - NAT, Ni - NAT inside, No - NAT outside, Nd - NAT DIA
       i - IS-IS, su - IS-IS summary, L1 - IS-IS level-1, L2 - IS-IS level-2
       ia - IS-IS inter area, * - candidate default, U - per-user static route
       H - NHRP, G - NHRP registered, g - NHRP registration summary
       o - ODR, P - periodic downloaded static route, l - LISP
       a - application route
       + - replicated route, % - next hop override, p - overrides from PfR
       & - replicated local route overrides by connected
Gateway of last resort is not set
      10.0.0.0/24 is subnetted, 3 subnets
m        10.11.11.1 [251/0] via 192.168.11.10, 04:03:35, Sdwan-system-intf
m        10.11.11.6 [251/0] via 192.168.13.10, 04:03:35, Sdwan-system-intf
m        10.11.11.30 [251/0] via 192.168.11.21, 04:03:35, Sdwan-system-intf
In this output, Ni - NAT inside is configured.
In this output, the lines beginning with m indicate that the NAT routes are added to the routing table.
