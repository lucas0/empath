  Dynamic VLAN Assignment with RADIUS Server
In most WLAN systems, each WLAN has a static policy that applies to all clients associated with a Service Set Identifier (SSID), or WLAN in the controller terminology. Although powerful, this method has limitations because it requires clients to associate with different SSIDs in order to inherit different QoS and security policies.
Cisco WLAN solution addresses that limitation by the support of identity networking. This allows the network to advertise a single SSID but allows specific users to inherit different QoS, VLAN attributes, and/or security policies based on the user credential.
Dynamic VLAN assignment is one such feature that places a wireless user into a specific VLAN based on the credentials supplied by the user. This task to assign users to a specific VLAN is handled by a RADIUS authentication server, such as Cisco ISE. This can be used, for example, in order to allow the wireless host to remain on the same VLAN as it moves within a campus network.
The Cisco ISE server authenticates wireless users against one of several possible databases, which includes its internal database. For example:
Internal DB
Active Directory
Generic Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)-compliant relational databases
Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman (RSA) SecurID token servers
RADIUS-compliant token servers
Cisco ISE Authentication Protocols and Supported External Identity Sources list the various authentication protocols supported by ISE internal and external databases.
This document focuses on authenticating wireless users that use Windows Active Directory external database.
After successful authentication, ISE retrieves the group information of that user from the Windows database and associates the user to the respective authorization profile.
When a client attempts to associate with a LAP registered with a controller, the LAP passes the credentials of the user to the WLC with the help of the respective EAP method.
WLC sends those credentials to ISE with the use of RADIUS protocol (encapsulating the EAP) and ISE passes the credentials of users to AD for validation with the help of the KERBEROS protocol.
AD validates the user credentials and upon successful authentication, informs the ISE.
Once the authentication is successful, the ISE server passes certain Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) attributes to WLC. These RADIUS attributes decide the VLAN ID that must be assigned to the wireless client. The SSID (WLAN, in terms of WLC) of the client does not matter because the user is always assigned to this predetermined VLAN ID.
The RADIUS user attributes used for the VLAN ID assignment are:
IETF 64 (Tunnel Type)—Set this to VLAN
IETF 65 (Tunnel Medium Type)—Set this to 802
IETF 81 (Tunnel Private Group ID)—Set this to VLAN ID
The VLAN ID is 12 bits and takes a value between 1 and 4094, inclusive. Because the Tunnel-Private- Group-ID is of type string, as defined in RFC2868 for use with IEEE 802.1X, the VLAN ID integer value is encoded as a string. When these tunnel attributes are sent, it is necessary to fill in the Tag field.
As noted in RFC 2868, section 3.1: the Tag field is one octet in length and is intended to provide a means of grouping attributes in the same packet which refer to the same tunnel. Valid values for this field are 0x01 through 0x1F, inclusive. If the Tag field is unused, it must be zero (0x00). Refer to RFC 2868 for more information on all RADIUS attributes.
Configure
This section provides the information needed to configure the described features in the document.
Network Diagram
Configurations
These are the configuration details of the components used in this diagram:
The IP address of the ISE (RADIUS) server is 10.48.39.128.
The Management and AP-manager Interface address of the WLC is 10.48.71.20.
DHCP server resides in the LAN network and is configured for respective client pools; it is not shown in the diagram.
VLAN1477 and VLAN1478 are used throughout this configuration. Users from the Marketing department are configured in order to be placed into the VLAN1477 and users from the HR department are configured in order to be placed into VLAN1478 by the RADIUS server when both users connect to the same SSID ― office_hq.
VLAN1477: 192.168.77.0/24. Gateway: 192.168.77.1 VLAN1478: 192.168.78.0/24. Gateway: 192.168.78.1 
This document uses 802.1x with PEAP-mschapv2 as the security mechanism.
Note: Cisco recommends that you use advanced authentication methods, such as EAP-FAST and EAP-TLS authentication, in order to secure the WLAN.
These assumptions are made before you perform this configuration:
The LAP is already registered with the WLC
The DHCP server is assigned a DHCP scope
Layer 3 connectivity exists between all devices in the network
The document discusses the configuration required on the wireless side and assumes that the wired network is in place
Respective users and groups are configured on AD
In order to accomplish dynamic VLAN assignment with WLCs based on ISE to AD group mapping, these steps must be performed:
ISE to AD integration and configuration of authentication and authorization policies for users on ISE.
WLC configuration in order to support dot1x authentication and AAA override for SSID 'office_hq'.
End client supplicant configuration.
ISE to AD Integration and Configuration of Authentication and Authorization Policies for Users on ISE
Login to the ISE Web UI interface using an admin account.
Navigate to Administration > Identity management > External Identity Sources > Active directory.



Click Add and enter the domain name and identity store name from the Active Directory Join Point Name settings. In the example, ISE is registered to the domain wlaaan.com and joinpoint is specified as AD.wlaaan.com - locally significant name to ISE.



A pop-up window opens after Submit button is pressed that asks you if you want to join ISE to AD immediately. Press Yes and provide Active Directory user credentials with admin rights to add a new host to the domain.



After this point, you must have ISE successfully registered to AD.



In case you have any issues with the registration process, you can use the Diagnostic Tool  in order to run the tests required for AD connectivity.
You must retrieve groups for the active Directories that are used in order to assign respective authorization profiles. Navigate to Administration > Identity management > External Identity Sources > Active directory > <Your AD> > Groups, then click Add and choose Select Groups from Active Directory.



A new pop-up window opens where you can either specify a filter in order to retrieve specific group(s) or retrieve all groups from AD.
Choose the respective groups from the AD group list and press OK.



Respective Groups are added to ISE and can be saved. Press Save.



Add WLC to the ISE Network device list - navigate to Administration > Network Resources > Network Devices and press Add.
Complete configuration, by providing WLC management IP address and RADIUS shared secret between WLC and ISE.



Now after you joined ISE to AD and added the WLC to the device list, you can start the configuration of authentication and authorization policies for users.
Create an authorization profile in order to assign users from Marketing to VLAN1477 and from the HR group to VLAN1478.
Navigate to Policy > Policy Elements > Results > Authorization > Authorization profiles and click the Add button in order to create a new profile.



Complete the authorization profile configuration with VLAN information for the respective group; the example shows Marketing group configuration settings.



Similar configuration must be done for other groups and respective VLAN tag attributes must be configured.
After authorization profiles are configured, you can define authentication policies for wireless users. This can be done either by configuring Custom or modifying the Default Policy set. In this example, the Default policy set is modified. Navigate to Policy > Policy Sets > Default. By default for dot1x authentication type, ISE is going to use All_User_ID_Stores, although it works even with current default settings since AD is part of the identity source list of All_User_ID_Stores, this example uses a more specific rule WLC_lab for that respective LAB controller and uses AD as the only source for authentication.



Now you must create authorization policies for users that assign respective authorization profiles based on group membership. Navigate to Authorization policy section and create policies in order to accomplish that requirement.

WLC Configuration to Support dot1x Authentication and AAA Override for SSID 'office_hq'
Configure ISE as a RADIUS authentication server on WLC. Navigate to Security > AAA > RADIUS > Authentication  section in the web UI interface and provide the ISE IP address and shared secret information.



Configure SSID office_hq under the WLANs section on the WLC; this example configures SSID with WPA2/AES+dot1x and AAA override. Interface Dummy is chosen for the WLAN since the proper VLAN is assigned via RADIUS anyway. This dummy interface must be created on the WLC and given an IP address, but the IP address does not have to be valid and the VLAN in which it is put can not be created in the uplink switch so that if no VLAN is being assigned, the client cannot go anywhere.













You must also create dynamic interfaces on the WLC for user VLANs. Navigate to Controller > Interfaces UI menu. The WLC can only honor the VLAN assignment received via AAA if it has a dynamic interface in that VLAN.


Verify
Use the Windows 10 native supplicant and Anyconnect NAM in order to test connections.
Since you are using EAP-PEAP authentication and ISE is using a Self-Signed Certificate (SSC), you must agree to a certificate warning or disable certificate validation. In a corporate environment, you must use a signed and trusted certificate on ISE and ensure that the end-user devices have the appropriate root certificate installed under the Trusted CA list.
Test connection with Windows 10 and native supplicant:
Open Network & Internet settings > Wi-Fi > Manage known networks  and create a new network profile by pressing the Add new network  button;fill in the required information.



Check the authentication log on ISE and ensure the right profile is selected for the user.



Check client entry on WLC and ensure it is assigned to the right VLAN and is in the RUN state.



From the WLC CLI, the client status can be checked with the show client dertails <mac-address>:
