Chapter: Licensing on Cisco SD-WAN
Chapter Contents
Cisco DNA Software subscriptions for Cisco SD-WAN gives the flexibility to consume the latest technology, either on the Cloud or On-Premises across the entire routing stack. Cisco DNA Software subscriptions provide customers with four key benefits:
Investment protection of software purchases through software-services-enabled license portability
Software suites that address typical customer use-case scenarios at an attractive price
Flexible licensing models to smoothly distribute your software spending over time
Access to new technology from Cisco
Cisco DNA licenses offer both portability and flexibility to move from cloud management (Cisco vManage) to on-premises management (Cisco DNA Center) and across hardware platforms.

Restrictions for Cisco SD-WAN Licensing
Smart Licensing, a standardized licensing platform that simplifies the Cisco software experience, is supported across ISR Series, ASR series, CSR1000V, and ISRv routers. However, Cisco SD-WAN does not support Smart Licensing, which is distinct from Smart License Using Policy. Although you can use the Cisco SD-WAN functionalities through the CSR1000V 17.2.1r image - controller mode, Cisco SD-WAN does not support Smart Licensing.
Beginning with Cisco IOS XE Release 17.5.1a and Cisco vManage Release 20.5.1, Cisco SD-WAN supports Smart License Using Policy. For more information about Smart Licensing Using Policy, see Manage Licenses for Smart Licensing Using Policy.
You cannot view license consumption information on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices and Cisco vEdge devices.
Configure Cisco SD-WAN Licensing
For devices operating with Cisco SD-WAN, note the following:
Cisco CSR1000V, Cisco Catalyst 8000V, and Cisco Integrated Services Virtual Router (ISRv) devices operating with a throughput of up to 250 Mbps do not require any manual configuration for licensing.
Cisco CSR1000V, Cisco Catalyst 8000V, and Cisco Integrated Services Virtual Router (ISRv) devices operating with a throughput of more than 250 Mbps require Cisco Smart Licensing, as described in this section.
To configure Smart Licensing, do the following:
Configure Smart Call Home.
Generate the token or authorization ID on Cisco Smart Software Manager (Cisco SSM) satellite.
Register the ISR, CSR1000v, or ISRv device to Cisco SSM.
You can purchase Cisco SD-WAN licenses by placing a sales order. For more information, contact your Cisco sales team.
Configure Licensing for Integrated Services Router Series
For Cisco Integrated Services Routers, if you want more than 250 Mbps of IPSec throughput, you must have a HSECK9 license. This requirement is due to the US export control regulations. If you ordered the HSECK9 license when you ordered the router, the HSECK9 license is installed by default. If the HSECK9 license was not installed by default, you must get a HSECK9 PAK license file and install the license file on each router.
Configure Licensing for Cisco CSR1000V, Cisco Catalyst 8000V, and Cisco ISRv Routers
For virtual routers such as the Cisco CSR1000V, Cisco Catalyst 8000V, and Cisco Integrated Services Virtual Router (ISRv), if you want more than 250 Mbps throughput, perform one of the following configurations to configure the call-home profile and then perform the other steps to configure a Smart License.
Default Configuration
For platforms other than the Cisco Catalyst 8000V, the following call-home configuration is a part of the default configuration. This minimal configuration is applicable for direct cloud access either using the Smart Call Home Transport Gateway or using the HTTPS proxy, where the device reaches out to the cloud-hosted Cisco SSM service. You can verify whether this configuration is applied by executing the show running-config all command.
call-home
 contact-email-addr sch-smart-licensing@cisco.com
 profile "CiscoTAC-1"
  active
  destination transport-method http
  destination address http https://tools.cisco.com/its/service/oddce/services/DDCEService
For Cisco Catalyst 8000V platforms, the following call-home configuration is part of the default configuration:
smart license url default
license smart transport smart
Configure a Device With Multiple Interfaces
To configure two or more interfaces that can reach the Cisco SSM portal, execute the ip http client source interface CLI so that the device uses that specific interface to reach out to the Cisco SSM portal.
ip http client source-interface <interface-name>                     <===
call-home
 contact-email-addr sch-smart-licensing@cisco.com
 profile "CiscoTAC-1"
  active
  destination transport-method http
  destination address http https://tools.cisco.com/its/service/oddce/services/DDCEService
Configure Call Home for DNS Resolution
To configure a call home profile for DNS resolution, execute the http resolve-hostname ipv4-first command so that the device uses an IPv4 interface for DNS resolution and to reach out to the Cisco SSM. If there are multiple IPv4 interfaces, one after another is tried for successful DNS resolution, and that specific interface is used to reach out to the Cisco SSM.
http resolve-hostname ipv4-first                                     <===
 profile "CiscoTAC-1"
  active
  destination transport-method http
  destination address http https://tools.cisco.com/its/service/oddce/services/DDCEService

Note
For detailed information about call-home profile for Cisco CSR1000V and Cisco ISRv devices, see Configuring Call Home Profile for Cisco CSR1000V.

Note
For information about restoring Smart Licensing when a device switches from autonomous to controller mode and back to autonomous mode again, see Restore Smart Licensing and Smart License Reservation.
Allow-Service
If you configure call-home to use a service-side interface, and not VPN0, for connectivity to the Cisco Smart Licensing portal, you do not need to configure allow-service .

Note
We recommend using a service-side interface.
If you use VPN0 for connectivity to the Cisco Smart Licensing portal, configure allow-service as follows:
allow-service http
Verifying Call Home Configuration
To verify the call-home configuration, use the show call-home detail command:
