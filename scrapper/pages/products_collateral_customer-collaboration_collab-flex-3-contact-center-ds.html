Table 5.        Additional Cisco Collaboration Flex 3.0 Contact Center agent type considerations
Agent Type Capabilities and Considerations
Descriptions
Agent flexibility
Within a single subscription, mixing is allowed among all deployment models and agent types.
Committed agents
This is applicable for Webex Contact Center and Webex Contact Center Enterprise. Cisco charges based on a usage model. You have the option to pay for a committed quantity of agents on the order. The committed agent quantity will be used to determine your excess agent usage for each month.
Agent overages1
Cloud solutions allow for agent usage in excess of the committed agent quantity selected on the order. Agent overages are calculated each month when the total number of agents used exceeds the total number of purchased committed agents on the order. On a monthly basis, Cisco will bill your reseller for excess usage for the agents used in excess of the number of committed agents on the order. Overage SKUs are now same price and discount as committed SKUs.
Note:      1 All agent overages are billed in arrears on a monthly basis to reconcile any usage in excess of the committed agent quantities for applicable products.
Platform
For each Cisco Collaboration Flex 3.0 Contact Center agent, you will designate one of three deployment models: hosted in Cisco’s cloud infrastructure; deployed on the subscriber’s own premises; or hosted by a Cisco partner.
