Objective
A firmware is a program that controls the operation and functionality of the network device. It is the combination of software and hardware that has program code and data stored in it in order for the device to function. New firmware releases have advanced features for network devices. Updated firmware versions on network devices keep them up-to-date with the latest releases and technologies like enhanced security, new features, bug fixes, or performance upgrades.
The performance of a network device can be enhanced when used with upgraded software or firmware. This process is also necessary if you encounter the following:
Frequent network disconnection or intermittent connection on your devices
Slow connection
