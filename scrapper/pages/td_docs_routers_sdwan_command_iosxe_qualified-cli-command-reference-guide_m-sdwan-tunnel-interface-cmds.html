Device(config-interface-ge0/2.101)# access-list acl1 in
allow-service
To configure the services that are allowed on a tunnel interface, use the allow-service command in tunnel interface configuration mode. To disallow a service on a tunnel interface, use the no form of the command.
allow-service service-name
no allow-service service-name
Syntax Description
service-name
Type of service to allow or disallow on the WAN tunnel connection.
service-name can be all or one of more of bfd, bgp, dhcp, dns, https, icmp, netconf, ntp, ospf, sshd, and stun. By default, DHCP (for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6), DNS, HTTPS, and ICMP are enabled on a tunnel interface.
You cannot disallow the following services: DHCP, DNS, NTP, and STUN. If you allow the NTP service on the tunnel interface, you must configure the address of an NTP server with the system ntp command. The allow-service stun command pertains to allowing or disallowing a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device to generate requests to a generic STUN server so that the device can determine whether it is behind a NAT and, if so, what kind of NAT it is and what the device's public IP address and public port number are. On a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device that is behind a NAT, you can also have tunnel interface to discover its public IP address and port number from the Cisco vBond orchestrator, by configuring the vbond-as-stun-server command on the tunnel interface.
To configure more than one service, include multiple allow-service commands. Configuring allow-service all overrides any commands that allow or disallow individual services.
Command Default
By default, DHCP (for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6), DNS, HTTPS, and ICMP are enabled on a tunnel interface.
Command Modes
tunnel interface configuration mode (config-tunnel-interface)

Command History
Release Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.5.1a
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
Use the auto-bandwidth-detect to configure a device to automatically detect the bandwidth for the VPN interface when the device boots up and connects to Cisco SD-WAN Manager after completing the PnP process. By default, the device uses a public iPerf3 server to perform a speed test for bandwidth detection. You can specify a private iPerf3 server to use instead by using the iperf-server command.
The private iPerf3 server should run on port 5201, which is the default iPerf3 port.
Example
The following example shows how to enable automatic bandwidth detection:
Device(config)# sdwan
Device(config-sdwan)# interface GigabitEthernet
Device(config-interface-GigabitEthernet) auto-bandwidth-detect
Table 1. Related Commands
Command
Description
iperf-server
Specifies a local iPerf3 server that a device contacts to perform a speed test for automatic bandwidth detection.
bandwidth-downstream
To generate notifications when the bandwidth of traffic received on a physical interface in the WAN transport VPN (VPN 0) exceeds a specific limit, use the bandwidth-downstream command in the SD-WAN physical interface configuration mode. Specifically, notifications are generated when traffic exceeds 85 percent of the bandwidth you configure with this command. To stop notification generation, use the no form of the command.
bandwidth-downstream kbps
no bandwidth-downstream
Syntax Description
kbps
Maximum received on a physical interface to allow before generating a notification. When the transmission rates exceeds 85 percent of this rate, an SNMP trap is generated.
Range: 1 through 2147483647 kbps
Command Default
By default, bandwidth notifications are not generated.
Command Modes

color
To assign a color to a WAN transport tunnel, use the color command in tunnel interface configuration mode. To remove the color assignment and revert to the default configuration, use the no form of the command.
color color
no color
Syntax Description
color
Identify an individual WAN transport tunnel by assigning it a color. The color is one of the TLOC parameters associated with the tunnel. On a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device, you can configure only one tunnel interface that has the color default. The colors metro-ethernet, mpls, and private1 through private6 are private colors. They use private addresses to connect to the remote side Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device in a private network. You can use these colors in a public network provided that there is no NAT device between the local and remote vEdge routers.
Values:
3g, biz-internet, blue, bronze, custom1, custom2, custom3, default, gold, green, lte, metro-ethernet, mpls, private1, private2, private3, private4, private5, private6, public-internet, red, and silver

Device(config-interface-GigabitEthernet1)# tunnel-interface
Device(config-tunnel-interface)# color lte
encapsulation
To configure the encapsulation for a tunnel interface, use the encapsulation command in the tunnel interface configuration mode. To disable the encapsulation configuration, use the no form of the command.
encapsulation { gre | ipsec } [ weight number ]
no encapsulation { gre | ipsec } [ weight ]
Syntax Description
{ gre | ipsec }
Configure the encapsulation to use on the tunnel interface. This encapsulation is one of the TLOC properties associated with the tunnel, along with the IP address and the color. The default IP MTU for GRE is 1468 bytes, and for IPsec it is 1442 bytes because of the larger overhead.
weight number
Weight to use to balance traffic across multiple tunnels (that is, across multiple TLOCs). A higher value sends more traffic to the tunnel. You typically set the weight based on the bandwidth of the TLOC. When a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device has multiple TLOCs, all with the highest preference, traffic distribution is weighted according to the configured weight value. For example, if TLOC A has weight 10, and TLOC B has weight 1, and both TLOCs have the same preference value, then roughly 10 flows are sent out TLOC A for every 1 flow sent out TLOC B.
Range: 1 through 255
Default: 1
Command Default
Encapsulation is not configured for a tunnel interface.
Command Modes
Tunnel interface configuration mode (config-tunnel-interface)
Command History
Release
Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco vManage CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
For a single tunnel, you can configure both IPsec and GRE encapsulations, by including two encapsulation commands. Cisco SD-WAN then creates two TLOCs for the tunnel interface. Both TLOCs have the same IP address and color, but one has IPsec encapsulation while the other has GRE encapsulation.
GRE encapsulation
Device(config)# sdwan

hello-interval
To configure the keepalive interval between Hello packets sent on a DTLS or TLS WAN transport connection, use the hello-interval command in tunnel interface configuration mode. To revert to the default configuration, use the no form of the command.
hello-interval milliseconds
no hello-interval
Syntax Description
milliseconds
Interval between Hello packets sent on a DTLS or TLS WAN tunnel connection. The combination of the hello interval and hello tolerance determines how long to wait before declaring a DTLS or TLS tunnel to be down.
The hello tolerance interval must be at least two times the tunnel hello interval. The default hello interval is 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
Note
  The hello interval is configured in milliseconds, and the hello tolerance is configured in seconds.
With the default hello interval of 1 second and the default tolerance of 12 seconds, if no Hello packet is received within 11 seconds, the tunnel is declared down at 12 seconds. If the hello interval or the hello tolerance, or both, are different at the two ends of a DTLS or TLS tunnel, the tunnel chooses the interval and tolerance as follows:
For a tunnel connection between a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device and any controller device, the tunnel uses the hello interval and tolerance times configured on the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device. This choice is made to minimize the amount traffic sent over the tunnel, to allow for situations where the cost of a link is a function of the amount of traffic traversing the link. The hello interval and tolerance times are chosen separately for each tunnel between a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device and a controller device.
Range: 100 through 600000 milliseconds (10 minutes)
Default: 1000 milliseconds (1 second)
Note
  If the tunnel interface is configured as a low-bandwidth link, the control connection might flap if you use a hello-interval of 100 milliseconds. For low-bandwidth link interfaces, use hello-interval of more than 100 milliseconds.
Command Default
The default hello interval is 1000 milliseconds.

hello-tolerance
To configure how long to wait for a Hello packet on a DTLS or TLS WAN transport connection before declaring that transport tunnel to be down, use the hello-tolerance command in tunnel interface configuration mode. To revert to the default configuration, use the no form of the command.
hello-tolerance seconds
no hello-tolerance
Syntax Description
seconds
How long to wait since the last Hello packet was sent on a DTLS or TLS WAN tunnel connection before declaring the tunnel to be down. The hello tolerance interval must be at least twice the hello interval, to ensure that at least one keepalive packet reaches and then returns from the remote side before timing out the peer. The default hello interval is 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
Note
  The hello interval is configured in milliseconds, and the hello tolerance is configured in seconds.
The combination of the hello interval and hello tolerance determines how long to wait before declaring a DTLS or TLS tunnel to be down.

Command Default
None
Command Modes

Command History
Release Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.5.1a
This command was introduced.
Usage Guidelines
When you use the auto-bandwidth-detect command to configure a device to perform automatic bandwidth detection, the device contacts an iPerf3 server to perform a speed test to determine the bandwidth. By default, the device contacts a public iPerf3 server for this speed test. Use the iperf-server to designate a private iPerf3 server that a device contacts instead.
We recommend that you use a private iPerf3 server. If a private iPerf3 server is not specified, the device pings a system defined set of public iPerf3 servers and selects for the speed test the public server with the minimum hops value. If all servers have the same minimum hops value, the device selects the server with the minimum and latency value. If the speed test fails, the device selects another public server from the list. The device continues to select other public iPerf3 servers until the speed test is successful or until it has tried all servers. Therefore, a speed test on a public iPerf3 server can use a server that is far away and there can be a larger latency than the minimum.
Example
The following example shows how to specify a private iPerf3 server for automatic bandwidth detection:
Device(config)# sdwan
Device(config-sdwan)# interface GigabitEthernet1
Device(config-interface-GigabitEthernet1) auto-bandwidth-detect
Device(config-interface-GigabitEthernet1) iperf-server 10.1.1.1

last-resort-circuit
To configure a tunnel interface as the circuit of last resort, use the last-resort-circuit command in tunnel interface configuration mode. To remove the configuration as the circuit of last resort, use the no form of the command.
last-resort-circuit
no last-resort-circuit
Syntax Description
This command has no arguments or keywords.

Command History
Release
Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco vManage CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
There is a delay of 7 seconds before switching back to the primary tunnel interface from a circuit of last resort. This delay is to ensure that the primary interface is once again fully operational and is not still flapping.
When you configure a tunnel interface to be a last-resort circuit, the cellular modem becomes dormant and no traffic is sent over the circuit. However, the cellular modem is kept in online mode so that the modem radio can be monitored at all times and to allow for faster switchover in the case the tunnel interface needs to be used as the last resort.
To minimize the amount of extraneous data plane traffic on a cellular interface that is a circuit of last resort, increase the BFD Hello packet interval and disable PMTU discover.

Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco SD-WAN Manager CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
This configuration command is relevant only for a spoke router in a hub-and-spoke deployment scenario, where the spoke has a low-bandwidth link, such as an LTE link. You include this configuration command only on the spoke router, to minimize traffic sent between the hub and the spoke.
The low bandwidth synchronizes all the BFD sessions and control session hello-interval on LTE WAN circuits to timeout at the same time. The periodic heartbeat messages are sent out at the same time to make optimal usage of LTE circuits radio waves or radio frequency energy to transmit and receive packets. The low bandwidth feature cannot reduce the number of hello packets to be transmitted (Tx) or received (Rx) for the sessions, but synchronizes the hello interval timeout for the sessions.
For example, if the BFD session and control connection hello-interval is 1 sec, and there is no user data traffic active on LTE circuits, then the sessions hello packets transmitted is spread across 1 sec window interval. Each session will timeout anywhere within that 1 sec interval and transmits the hello packet. This makes the LTE radio to be active almost all the time. With low bandwidth feature, all the session hello packets transmits at the same time, and leave the rest of the 1sec interval idle, makes optimal usage of LTE modem radio energy.

Note
To prevent control-connection flapping when an interface is configured as a low-bandwidth link, use a hello-interval of greater than 100 milliseconds.
Example
Device(config)# sdwan                                                                                                                
Device(config-sdwan)# interface GigabitEthernet1

max-control-connections
To configure the maximum number of Cisco SD-WAN Controllers that a Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device is allowed to connect to, use the max-control-connections command in tunnel interface configuration mode. To remove the configuration, use the no form of the command.

Note
For control connection traffic without dropping any data, a minimum of 650-700 kbps bandwidth is recommended with default parameters configured for hello-interval (10) and hello-tolerance (12).
max-control-connections number
no max-control-connections
Syntax Description
number
Sets the maximum number of Cisco SD-WAN Controllers that the vEdge router can connect to. These connections are DTLS or TLS control plane tunnels.
Range: 0 through 100
Default: 
Command Default
By default, the maximum number of controller connections is set to the same value as the maximum number of OMP sessions configured using the system max-omp-sessions command.
Command Modes

Command History
Release
Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco SD-WAN Manager CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
When max-control-connections is configured without affinity, devices establish control connection with Cisco SD-WAN Controllers having higher System-IP.
Example
Device(config)# sdwan                                                                                                                
Device(config-sdwan)# interface GigabitEthernet1                                                                                     
Device(config-interface-GigabitEthernet1)# tunnel-interface
Device(config-tunnel-interface)# max-control-connections 1
nat-refresh-interval
To configure the interval between NAT refresh packets sent on a DTLS or TLS WAN transport connection, use the nat-refresh-interval command in tunnel interface configuration mode. This interval is how often a tunnel interface sends a refresh packet to maintain the UDP packet streams that traverse a NAT. To revert to the default configuration, use the no form of the command.
nat-refresh-interval seconds
no nat-refresh-interval
Syntax Description
seconds
Interval between NAT refresh packets sent on a DTLS or TLS WAN tunnel connection. These packets are sent to maintain the UDP packet streams that traverse a NAT between the device and the Internet or other public network. You might want to increase the interval on interfaces where you are charged for bandwidth, such as LTE interfaces.
Range: 1 through 60 seconds
Default: 5 seconds
Command Default
A tunnel interface has a default NAT refresh interval of 5 seconds.

port-hop
On a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device behind a NAT device, to configure a tunnel interface to rotate through a pool of preselected OMP port numbers, known as base ports, to establish DTLS connections with other WAN edge devices when a connection attempt is unsuccessful, use the port-hop command in tunnel interface configuration mode. To disable port hopping for a tunnel interface, use the no form of the command.
port-hop
no port-hop
Syntax Description
This command has no arguments or keywords.
Command Default
Port hopping is enabled on a tunnel interface.
Command Modes
tunnel interface configuration mode (config-tunnel-interface)
Command History
Release
Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco vManage CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
For a tunnel interface (TLOC) on a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device behind a NAT device, you can configure the interface to rotate through a pool of preselected OMP port numbers, known as base ports, to establish DTLS connections with other WAN edge devices when a connection attempt is unsuccessful. By default, port hopping is enabled on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices and on all tunnel interfaces on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.
There are five base ports: 12346, 12366, 12386, 12406, and 12426. These port numbers determine the ports used for connection attempts. The first connection attempt is made on port 12346. If the first connection does not succeed after about 1 minute, port 12366 is tried. After about 2 minutes, port 12386 is tried; after about 5 minutes, port 12406; after about 6 minutes, port 12426 is tried. Then the cycle returns to port 12346.
If you have configured a port offset with the port-offset command, the five base ports are a function of the configured offset. For example, with a port offset of 2, the five base ports are 12348, 12368, 12388, 12408, and 12428. Cycling through these base ports happens in the same way as if you had not configured an offset.
Example
Device(config)# sdwan

Command History
Release
Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco vManage CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
Configuring an interface to be a transport tunnel enables the flow of control and data traffic on the interface. On a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device, you must also configure the interface's TLOC attributes, which are carried in the TLOC OMP routes that the device sends to the Cisco vSmart controllers in its domain. For the TLOC attributes on the device, you must configure, at a minimum, a color and an encapsulation type. These two attributes, along with the router's system IP address, are the 3-tuple that uniquely identify each TLOC.
Example
Device(config)# sdwan                                                                                                                
Device(config-sdwan)# interface GigabitEthernet1                                                                                     
Device(config-interface-GigabitEthernet1)# tunnel-interface
vbond-as-stun-server
To enable Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) and allow the tunnel interface to discover its public IP address and port number when the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device is located behind a NAT, use the vbond-as-stun-server command in tunnel interface configuration mode. When you configure this command, Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices can exchange their public IP addresses and port numbers over private TLOCs. To disable STUN, use the no form of the command.
vbond-as-stun-server
no vbond-as-stun-server
Syntax Description
This command has no arguments or keywords.
Command Default
STUN is not enabled by default.
Command Modes
tunnel interface configuration mode (config-tunnel-interface)
Command History
Release
Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco vManage CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
With this configuration, the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device uses the Cisco vBond orchestrator as a STUN server, so that the device can determine its public IP address and public port number. The device cannot learn the type of NAT that it is behind. No overlay network control traffic is sent and no keys are exchanged over tunnel interface configured to use the Cisco vBond orchestrator as a STUN server. However, BFD does come up on the tunnel, and data traffic can be sent on it.
Example
Device(config)# sdwan                                                                                                                
Device(config-sdwan)# interface GigabitEthernet1                                                                                     
Device(config-interface-GigabitEthernet1)# tunnel-interface
Device(config-tunnel-interface)# vbond-as-stun-server
vmanage-connection-preference
To configure the preference for using a tunnel interface to exchange control traffic with the Cisco vManage NMS, use the vmanage-connection-preference command in tunnel interface configuration mode. Configuring this option is useful for LTE and other links on which you want to minimize traffic. To remove the configured preference and revert to the default configuration, use the no form of the command.
vmanage-connection-preference number
no vmanage-connection-preference
Syntax Description
number
Preference for using the tunnel interface to exchange control traffic with the Cisco vManage NMS. The tunnel with the higher value has a greater preference to be used for connections to the Cisco vManage NMS. To have a tunnel interface never connect to the Cisco vManage NMS, set the preference value to 0. At least one tunnel interface on the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device must have a non-0 preference value.
Range: 0 through 8
Default: 5
Command Default
A tunnel interface has a default preference of 5.
