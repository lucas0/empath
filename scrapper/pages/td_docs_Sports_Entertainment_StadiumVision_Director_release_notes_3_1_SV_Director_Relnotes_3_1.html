Figure 3 shows the use of Hierarchical Management in Cisco StadiumVision Director, where a central site user with administrator role-based access control (RBAC) permissions is located at the central site data center where the primary Cisco StadiumVision Director server resides.
Figure 3 Hierarchical Management in Centralized Cisco StadiumVision Director
  The administrator can perform all venue-related functions, including assigning venue operators, content and scripts into their corresponding venue-specific scopes of control. At the remote venues, the remote venue operators can control the scripts associated to their assigned venue scope-of-control.
For more information, see the following modules of the Cisco StadiumVision Director Server Administration Guide, Release 3.1 :
For a description of the supported user roles in Cisco StadiumVision Director, see the “User Management in Cisco StadiumVision Director” module.
For information about configuring remote venues in a centralized Cisco StadiumVision Director network architecture, see the “Configuring Cisco StadiumVision Director for Multiple Venue Support” module.
WAN Optimization
In the non-distributed Cisco StadiumVision Director environment, the Cisco StadiumVision Director server sends all staged content to every DMP over the local network. This distribution of content is not efficient for the smaller and more expensive WAN links in a distributed Cisco StadiumVision Director architecture with remote servers.
Figure 4 shows how transmission of data is optimized over the WAN in the distributed environment, where the central Cisco StadiumVision Director server sends each content piece directly to the Cisco StadiumVision Director Remote server once, rather than sending multiple transmissions of that content to each remote DMP. The remote server then sends the content it receives to each of the DMPs that it supports on its local network.
Figure 4 Scalable File-Based Content Distribution
  WAN optimization has the following benefits:
Improved performance by having each content piece cross a WAN link one time (per venue with Cisco StadiumVision Remote server).
Reduction in staging time.
Increased bandwidth availability for other business applications.
Reduced WAN infrastructure costs.
Multicast Optimization
The Multicast Optimization feature reduces the scope of multicast messages that are part of an event script configured for DMPs located in Cisco StadiumVision Director Remote venues. When configured properly, multicast optimization allows the Cisco StadiumVision Director Remote server to rebroadcast multicast messages associated with scripts for that venue to be seen only by the DMPs associated with that remote site.
Multicast optimization is automatically supported for Cisco StadiumVision Director Remote venues and is supported when DMP locations are associated to a venue and the script is configured to run only on DMPs at that venue.
For more information about configuring remote venues in a centralized Cisco StadiumVision Director network architecture, see the “Configuring Cisco StadiumVision Director for Multiple Venue Support” module of the Cisco StadiumVision Director Server Administration Guide, Release 3.1.
DMP Content Expiration
In Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.1, the system automatically expires content on DMPs that has not been referenced (that is, staged in a script) for a period of time. For non-video content, unreferenced content is expired after 14 days, and unreferenced video content is expired after 180 days.
In both cases, once the content has been flagged for expiration, it will be removed from the DMP at the next staging operation for that device.
The expiration periods are set by default in the following registry keys in the Management Dashboard ( Table 12 ):
  Table 12 Registry Keys for DMP Content Expiration
Registry Key
Default Value
staging.contentDaysToKeep
14 (days)
staging.videoContentDaysToKeep
180 (days)
External Content Integration
Figure 5 shows a high-level overview of the content support in the External Content Integration feature in Cisco StadiumVision Director. Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0 introduced integration with external data sources for content ingestion and presentation for NFL GSIS statistics, game clock, and certain scoreboard devices. Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.1 adds support for predefined data feeds such as RSS and Atom, as well as support for generic XML data sources.
Figure 5 External Content Integration High-Level Overview
  The enhancements to the External Content Integration feature in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.1 includes support for the following updates:
Predefined Atom and RSS data sources.
Generic XML data sources.
Advanced configuration support for Data views that allow you to merge data from multiple feeds and use an expression editor to select certain data elements from those feeds to be put into a single combined data source for presentation.
Preview of live data from the Data Integration interface and from the Widgets layout tool.
For more information on External Content Integration, see the Cisco StadiumVision Director External Content Integration Guide, Release 3.1.
Daktronics Scoreboard Integration
This section describes changes in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.1.0-787 (SP1) in addition to the feature support described in the Cisco StadiumVision Director External Content Integration Guide, Release 3.1.
In Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.1.0-787 (SP1), support for Daktronics scoreboard integration requires the addition of the Lantronix UDS1100-PoE box. This device must be configured to allow connectivity to the Cisco StadiumVision Director server. Figure 6 shows an updated high-level overview of the supported scoreboard integration with Cisco StadiumVision Director in Release 3.1 SP1.
Note Daktronics scoreboard integration supports hockey and NBA basketball data only.
Figure 6 Scoreboard Integration High-Level Overview in Release 3.1 SP1
  Data Throttling Default Values and Registry Configuration
In Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.1, certain data throttling values for External Content Integration that were configurable within the Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0 user interface per data source were changed to be configurable as registry keys in the Management Dashboard that now apply globally to all configured data sources.
Note The default values and units of measure (from seconds to milliseconds) for these registry keys were changed in Cisco StadiumVison Director Release 3.1 SP1. However, if you have modified these values from the original default values, then the new default values will not be applied. However, be aware that the units of measure will be changed to milliseconds so be sure that you manually convert your original value from seconds to milliseconds.
Caution Configuration of data throttling can be required to maintain optimum DMP performance to support External Content Integration in Cisco StadiumVision Director. Be sure that if you plan to modify the data throttling values, you understand that DMP performance could be severely impacted, and that you make changes only when no events are running in the venue and during an adequate maintenance window for the system.

The actual performance impact is dependent on a combination of factors including the registry values that are set, the number of data sources, and the amount of content / widgets / datasources visible on the DMP display.
Table 13 describes the global registry keys that apply to all data sources configured for External Content Integration in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.1.
  Table 13 External Content Integration Data Throttling Registry Keys
Registry Key
New Default (Release 3.1 SP1)
Old Default
(Release 3.1)
Description
databind.minUpdateInterval
500 ms
(.5 seconds)
10 seconds
Specifies the amount of time to wait since the last update before sending a multicast of new data from the External Content Integration service to all DMPs.
Modify this registry key value to tune the display of clock values in Cisco StadiumVision Director (when they are inaccurate to the second), by lowering the default number of milliseconds.
Note This global registry key corresponds to the original “Wait to push data to destination” data throttling option in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0, but the option can no longer be set per data source and applies to all configured data sources.
Tip This control is different than the “Incoming data filter rate” data throttling option that specifies the amount of time to process only new data from the data source to the External Content Integration service.
databind.maxUpdateInterval
60000 ms
(60 seconds)
60 seconds
Specifies the longest amount of time to wait before sending the multicast of any unchanged data to all DMPs.
For data sources that support setting of polling intervals, the practical lower limit for this registry key corresponds to that polling interval. The interval cannot be set lower than 1000 ms.
Note This global registry key corresponds to the original “Push data if wait exceeds” data throttling option in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.0, but the option can no longer be set per data source and applies to all configured data sources.
External Triggers
Beginning in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.1, output triggers also can be configured by the administrator to send a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request to notify external systems of a script event and trigger an action externally. This functionality can be used with the Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Streamer to trigger actions on mobile devices, such as for ad insertion.
Figure 7 shows the different methods that can be used as external output triggers from an event script on the Cisco StadiumVision Director server. Just as with input triggers, the supported methods include an HTTP call (like a software-based, virtual contact closure) with a 3rd party application, or a standard contact closure.
In addition, the Cisco StadiumVision Mobile Streamer can be used with the HTTP call method to initiate actions on mobile devices.
Figure 7 Output Trigger Methods From Cisco StadiumVision Director
  For more information about configuring external trigger support by Cisco StadiumVision Director administrators who are responsible for working with third-party developers and system integrators to establish connectivity for external triggers, see the Configuring Cisco StadiumVision Director for External Triggers, Release 3.1 guide.

Control Panel > Control—The Staging control has been relocated here.
Control Panel > Content—Playlist types have been modified to include mixed media support.
The following two types are supported in Release 3.1:
– Non Video—Used only for playlists that do not include video content.
– Video and Mixed Media—Used for any playlist that contains video content.
Control Panel > Setup
The following changes have been made:
– The tabs have been renamed.
– The Staging interface has been moved under the Control menu.
User TV Control
Support for all methods of user TV control is enabled by default in Cisco StadiumVision Director. This includes control of TV displays using local control devices and applications, IP phones, touch screens, and infrared remote (IR) control.
Some venues have a need to disable user TV control for certain events or suites, or to limit the TV to display a particular channel or control its volume.
Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.1 introduces two ways for you to disable user control of TVs:
Defining the “Disable User Control” action in a script.
Running the “Disable User Control” TV command from the Management Dashboard.
Using one of these two methods, you can disable support for all of the default types of user TV control (excluding TV off control). You can also use these methods to re-enable user TV control using the corresponding “Enable User Control” script action or TV command.
You can verify the user TV control state for a particular DMP using the Status Details area of the Management Dashboard. Go to the General drop-down menu and look at the value displayed in the User Input field as shown in Figure 8.

Important Upgrade Notes
Installation Requirements for Licensing Compliance
To maintain software licensing compliance, Cisco StadiumVision Director servers must be installed in the following manner:
The Cisco StadiumVision Director server is installed in a data center or in an enterprise data closet.
The Cisco StadiumVision Director Remote software is installed on the customer’s choice of hardware that supports a VMware virtualized environment, or the remote server hardware is installed in a data center or in an enterprise data closet.
Installation Requirements on New Platform 3 Servers
Caution New Platform 3 servers (SV-DIR-DIRECTOR-K9 and SV-PLATFORM3=) come preinstalled with a preliminary image of Cisco StadiumVision Director that is not intended for production operation. You must install the Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.1 software from a full ISO image (not an upgrade) that you downloaded from Cisco.com to be sure that you are running the released production version of Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.1.
For information about installing a fresh ISO image on a Platform 3 server, see the Cisco StadiumVision Director Software Installation and Upgrade Guide, Release 3.1.
Cisco StadiumVision Director Remote OVA Deployment
A known problem in the deployment of VMware OVA templates can occur with the Cisco StadiumVision Director Remote OVA template, where sometimes the Linux OS creates a new “eth0” network interface and renames the original one to “eth0.bak.” If this happens, ignore the “eth0.bak” interface and configure the network using the “eth0” interface.
For more information about installing Cisco StadiumVision Director Remote, see the Cisco StadiumVision Director Remote Installation and Upgrade Guide, Release 3.1.
CIMC and BIOS Firmware Installation for Cisco StadiumVision Director Platform 2 Servers
Platform 2 (SV-DIRECTOR-K9 or SV-PLATFORM2=) of the Cisco StadiumVision Director server requires installation of the Unified Computing System (UCS) Server Firmware Version 1.4(2) or later to avoid problems powering off the server hardware.
Verifying the BIOS Firmware Version
You can verify the firmware version installed on Platform 2 of the Cisco StadiumVision Director server by running a Basic System State Report from the Cisco StadiumVision Director main menu.
Note BIOS firmware version 1.4.1 is the compatible version packaged with CIMC firmware version 1.4.2.
In the OS Information section of the Basic System State Report, look for “BIOS Information” and “Version” below the “Handle 0x00005, DMI type 0, 24 bytes” line, as shown in the following example.
If your version is less than “1.4.1,” then an upgrade is needed:

Installation and Upgrade Files
Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.1 software is available in different types of files based on the installation or upgrade environment.
ISO Files
ISO files are packaged images that are available in two versions:
An ISO full image—The full ISO file is to be installed only on brand new Cisco StadiumVision Director servers that have no prior Cisco StadiumVision Director software version installed.
An ISO upgrade image—The upgrade ISO file is built for processing using the TUI upgrade utility.
Note ISO upgrade images are available for both Cisco StadiumVision Director and Cisco StadiumVision Director Remote software.
OVA Files
The Cisco StadiumVision Director Remote software is delivered as an Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) template to be installed with a VMware ESXi host.
Software Download
Note You are eligible to obtain information about how to access the Cisco StadiumVision Director full ISO file or Cisco StadiumVision Director Remote OVA file after you have purchased the proper licensing. Contact Cisco Technical Support for information about how to download these files.
If you have a Cisco CCO account and a contract for software download, you can download the Cisco StadiumVision Director installation and upgrade files on the Cisco.com software download site at:
http://www.cisco.com/cisco/software/navigator.html?mdfid=283479662&i=rm
Upgrade Process
Upgrades to the Cisco StadiumVision Director and Cisco StadiumVision Director Remote software are made available using the ISO upgrade utility available from the TUI. The ISO upload utility uses a special upgrade ISO file available from the Cisco.com software download site.
For Cisco StadiumVision Director, there are two upgrade environments for Release 3.1, which have different upgrade requirements:
Upgrading an existing server from Release 3.0.0-433 Service Pack 2 to Release 3.1.
Depending on your server environment, this requires you to upgrade DMP firmware, install additional hard drives, upgrade CIMC/BIOS, and perform the ISO upgrade.
Upgrading an existing server already running Release 3.1 to a more recent 3.1 release.
This environment generally requires that you only perform an ISO software upgrade.
For more details about upgrading the Cisco StadiumVision Director software for your environment, see the Cisco StadiumVision Director Software Installation and Upgrade Guide, Release 3.1.
For more details about upgrading the Cisco StadiumVision Director Remote software for your environment, see the Cisco StadiumVision Director Remote Installation and Upgrade Guide, Release 3.1.
VLAN Compliance Check
A VLAN compliance check for DMPs is supported in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.1. After you upgrade to release 3.1, you need to go to the Management Dashboard and change the Assigned VLAN property under Global DMP Settings for both the 4310 and 4310 v5.2.3 settings according to your DMP VLAN configuration as follows:
If all of your DMPs are located on the same VLAN (recommended)—Type the number of the VLAN and save the configuration.
If all of your DMPs are not located on the same VLAN, or you want to bypass any VLAN compliance checking—Type “ $svd_ignore ” and save the configuration.
Note The default Assigned VLAN property value is $svd_ignore.
The value in the Assigned VLAN property in the Management Dashboard settings for the DMP 4310s is checked against the value being sent by the DMP, unless you have configured $svd_ignore.
Caution DMP auto-registration support requires that the VLAN value is correctly set or “$svd_ignore” is used.
Figure 9 shows how to configure the Assigned VLAN property under the 4310 Settings for DMPs that are not located on the same VLAN using the “$svd_ignore” string.
You will also need to set this Assigned VLAN property value for the 4310 v5.x.x Settings:
Figure 9 Assigned VLAN Property Configuration for DMPs
  Limitations and Restrictions
When using Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.1, be aware of the following limitations and restrictions:
Caution Proof of play raw data repository in /var/sv/pofp/raw directory is not part of the backup process. In normal operation, a completed script with a green dot already has a copy of the raw data and is part of the backup data. No further action is needed aside from generating the PoP report. For completed scripts that do not have a green dot, it is very important to investigate or call for support within 60 days of the event, after which time the PoP messages in the raw directory will be deleted.
If you have previously accessed a different Cisco StadiumVision Director version on your computer, sometimes unexpected behavior or warnings arise, or you might access an older version of the interface. In this case, and especially after an upgrade, you must clear your browser cache.
The first release of Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.1 implements the infrastructure only to support i18n and L10n to support the independent installation of other language packs with Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.1 as they become available. Language support for Release 3.1 is introduced in Release 3.1.0-787 (SP1). See the “Service Packs for Localization” section.
Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.1 does not support internationalization for back-end messaging.
Non-English characters are not supported as a Cisco StadiumVision Director login credential.
Multi-user support in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.1 is limited to script editing only. No other Control Panel functions for templates, zones, groups, and playlists support a multi-user environment, and these areas can be deleted by other users. However, users are notified about potential impact due to currently locked scripts and are prompted for confirmation of deletion and given an option to use instant messaging to coordinate with the script owner.
No more than 10 users can be supported at any one time in the Management Dashboard and Control Panel areas. The system does not prevent more than 10 sessions to be opened, so you need to be careful that you do not exceed this limit.
No more than 50 staging threads can be processing in Cisco StadiumVision Director at any one time. The default maximum is 10. The maximum is configured using the “stagingThreadNum” registry found under the Tools > Advanced > Registry section of the Management Dashboard.
Note If auto-registration is enabled and a new DMP is detected, then Cisco StadiumVision Director initiates staging and always uses 50 as the maximum value. In this case, the stagingThreadNum registry setting is ignored and remains unchanged.
Consider the following restrictions and expected behavior when configuring playlists:
– Single video loop—You can configure a playlist to loop continuously when you have a playlist with a single video content item set for a duration of zero, with the playlist duration also set to zero.
– Single non-video loop—You can configure a playlist to loop continuously when you have a playlist with a single non-video content item by setting the item duration to -1, and setting the playlist duration to a number greater than or equal to zero.
– All playlists will loop their content (for example, once the last item plays, the playlist restarts with the first item) unless a duration of zero is configured on the first playlist item.
– To run a playlist one time, you can specify a duration of zero for the last item in the playlist. There is different behavior if the last item is a non-video item versus a video. If the last item has zero duration, and once the rest of the playlist items run, then if the last item is a non-video item, it continuously plays for the duration of the state. If the last item is a video, the video plays one time followed by a black screen for the duration of the state.
– If a change is made to a playlist and the playlist is currently being displayed, it is possible that items in the playlist that are past an item in the playlist with a duration of zero, could get displayed and the playlist continues until the item with zero duration is reached again.
Important Notes
This section includes other important information about the Cisco StadiumVision solution that you should know for optimal operation.
DMP Maintenance Recommendations
To avoid unexpected behavior and maintain normal operation of your devices, it is highly recommended that you perform a soft reboot of all of the DMPs in your system each week. You can reboot DMPs manually or configure a periodic task to run automatically.
Note Before you perform a reboot, be sure that there are not any active scripts running.
For more information see the “ How to Configure the Reboot DMP System Task From the Management Dashboard ” task note.

Open Defects in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.1.0-510
This section lists the defects that are open in Cisco StadiumVision Director Release 3.1.0-510.
CSCuf39019—In Content screen replacing multiple files at once might sometimes fail.
Symptom When uploading multiple (more than 1) content items at once to replace existing content (same filename but different content), only some of the files might get replaced.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Go to Control Panel > Content.
2. Upload some files (such as 5).
3. Using a different set of files, rename them to match the names of the 5 files that you have just uploaded.
4. Upload the new files.
Workaround Upload a single file at a time when replacing existing content.
CSCuf24673—Mixed template to mixed template state transition fails to stop video.
Symptom If the first item in the mixed media playlist for the destination state is a static image (jpeg, png, and so on), then the video continues to play in the background until the video finishes. At that point it will not go on to the next video in the playlist. The expected behavior is the video playback should stop.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Create a state in a video playlist with several videos and another state with static content (jpeg, png, etc.) playlist and both using a mixed media template.
2. Try using static content that is smaller than the region so the background shows through, so that it is easier to see the issue.
3. Increase the TV volume.
4. Start the script and go to the video playlist state.
5. Then, go to the static content state.
Workaround Avoid using static content (jpeg, png, and so on) as the first item in a mixed media playlist using a mixed template. If the static content state uses a non-video template then there is no issue. It is an issue for a mixed region state change to a mixed region.
DE1525 - SSC albums do not work for DMP locations that are associated with a Cisco StadiumVision Director Remote server venue.
Symptom For suite locations associated with Cisco StadiumVision Director Remote server venues, the CMS fails to publish an SSC album, but SSC shows that the publishing was successful. The files are copied to the DMP even though the CMS internally shows that staging failed.
Conditions The following steps recreate the conditions when this defect occurs:
1. Enable Cisco StadiumVision Director for multiple venue support.
2. Create a venue and make sure that a working Cisco StadiumVision Director Remote server is attached to that venue.
3. Assign a set of DMPs+Locations to the venue.
4. Create a luxury suite and assign one or more of your venue DMPs to the suite.
5. Create an SSC user and authorize all of the luxury suite DMPs for the SSC user.
6. Log into Cisco StadiumVision Director as the SSC user to go to the SSC portal.
7. Create a new album with some content in it.
8. Publish the album.
Workaround There is no workaround. Do not authorize remote DMP locations for SSC users.

4. Save and close the widget and then reload the UI.
5. Open the widget that you just created. Notice that the data binding was not saved.
Workaround To use data binding with RSS, Atom, or generic feeds, use the TextToScreen or PicToScreen components in the Widgets tool.
DE1489—After disassociate multiple locations from a venue, the UI becomes out of sync.
Symptom In Control Panel > Setup > Venues > Locations tab, when removing multiple locations from the Assigned Locations box to the Available Locations box, not all locations are shown as moved to Available Locations. The move-right button (>>) is also grayed out. Sometimes more than one location will be left in the Assigned Locations box, but at least one location is always left in the Assigned Locations box.

2. Select the Locations tab and add multiple locations to the venue by selecting the locations and clicking the << button.
3. Click Save.
4. Select all of those DMP locations that you just moved to the left and click on the >> button.
Notice that at least one location (sometimes even multiple locations) is still left in the Assigned Locations box. However, the >> button is disabled preventing the user from moving the location.
5. Save the changes and refresh the browser.
The leftover DMPs are still assigned to the venue.
Workaround Unselect and then reselect the locations that are still left in the Assigned location panel. This will enable the >> button. Then, click >> to remove the DMPs from the Assigned box and click Save.

Conditions In the Management Dashboard, run TV Commands > Show Init Swf for a DMP.
Workaround There is no workaround.
DE1435—After GetStatus on a non-compliant DMP, the Management Dashboard shows green status.
Symptom The status symbol for the non-compliant DMP is fully green even though it should be green with a yellow triangle.
Conditions In the Management Dashboard, perform a GetStatus on a DMP that is non-compliant.
Workaround In the Management Dashboard, run the Ping command immediately after GetStatus. This corrects any green status symbols that were in error.
