Configure SD-WAN RA
To configure SD-WAN RA headend functionality on a Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device, complete the following tasks.

Important
The configuration steps described here are presented as high-level tasks. For details about using Cisco vManage feature templates and CLI add-on templates, see the Cisco SD-WAN documentation. For information about configuring Cisco AnyConnect or a RADIUS server, see the documentation for those products.

Note
We recommend using a RADIUS server for per-user credentials, and for per-user and group policy. We do not recommend configuring credentials and policy locally, as this method does not scale.
Configuration Tasks

Note
When configuring a device to function as an SD-WAN RA headend, we recommend using a single CLI add-on template for all of the required configuration commands. The tasks are described separately, but you can combine the configuration commands into one template. Use the configuration commands in config-transaction mode.
In Cisco vManage, use a CLI add-on template for the SD-WAN RA headend device to configure the following:
Configure an IKEv2 proposal.
crypto ikev2 proposal ikev2-proposal-name 
encryption encryption-algorithms 
integrity integrity-algorithms 
group DH-group-numbers 
prf prf-algorithms 
Example:
crypto ikev2 proposal sdra_ikev2_proposal
encryption aes-cbc-256
integrity sha256
group 19
prf sha384
Configure an IKEv2 policy.
crypto ikev2 policy ikev2-policy-name 
proposal ikev2-proposal-name 
Example:
crypto ikev2 policy sdra_ikev2_policy
proposal sdra_ikev2_proposal
Configure IKEv2 parameters.
crypto ikev2 cookie-challenge threshold-half-open-connections 
crypto ikev2 fragmentation mtu ikev2-mtu 
Example:
crypto ikev2 cookie-challenge 100
crypto ikev2 fragmentation mtu 1400
Task 2: Configure a PKI Trustpoint for Certificate Enrollment
Perform this task if the RA headend is configured to use certificate authentication.
In Cisco vManage, use a CLI add-on template for the SD-WAN RA headend device to configure a PKI trustpoint that specifies a CA server for SCEP-based auto enrollment.
crypto pki trustpoint sdra_trustpoint 
 auto-enroll renewal_percentage 
 enrollment url http://ca-ip-address:80 
 fingerprint ca_certificate_fingerprint  
 subject-name cn= subj-name-string 
 revocation-check none  
 auto-trigger  
 vrf ca-vrf 
Example:
crypto pki trustpoint sdra_trustpoint
auto-enroll 80
enrollment url http://10.1.1.11
fingerprint 0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF
subject-name cn=sdra_headend_1
revocation-check none
auto-trigger
vrf 1
Task 3: Configure an IKEv2 Profile
The IKEv2 profile enables grouping of peers by identity, and specifies authentication and authorization policy.
Configure an IKEv2 Profile
In Cisco vManage, use a CLI add-on template for the SD-WAN RA headend device to configure the following:
Configure an IKEv2 profile.
Specify a name for the profile.
crypto ikev2 profile sdra_ikev2_profile 
Match peer identities and specify a local identity.

aaa authorization group peer-auth-type list sdra_author_mlist name-mangler sdra-group-author-name-mangler password sdra-radius-password 
Enable AAA accounting.
aaa accounting peer-auth-type list sdra_acc_mlist 
Specify an IPsec virtual-template interface.
virtual-template interface-number mode auto 
Example:
crypto ikev2 profile sdra_ikev2_profile
 match identity remote any 
 identity local email sdra_headend1@abc.com
 authentication local rsa-sig
 authentication remote anyconnect-eap aggregate
 pki trustpoint sdra_pki_trustpoint
 aaa authentication anyconnect-eap sdra_authen_mlist
 aaa authorization user anyconnect-eap cached
 aaa authorization group anyconnect-eap list sdra_author_mlist name-mangler sdra_group_author_name_mangler password sdra_radius_author_passwd
 aaa accounting anyconnect-eap sdra_acc_mlist
 virtual-template 1 mode auto
Configure the IKEv2 name mangler to extract the domain portion from the peer identity, using a Cisco vManage CLI template.
crypto ikev2 name-mangler sdra_group_author_name 
 fqdn domain 
 email domain 
 eap suffix delimiter @  
Example:
crypto ikev2 name-mangler sdra_group_author_name_mangler
fqdn domain
email domain
eap suffix delimiter @
Task 4: Configure IPsec Ciphers, Parameters, and Template Interface
Before You Begin
In step 3, the interface Virtual-Template command specifies a service VPN VRF. Before beginning this procedure, define the VRF. You can use a Cisco vManage feature template to define the VRF.
Configure IPsec Ciphers, Parameters, and Template Interface
In Cisco vManage, use a CLI add-on template for the SD-WAN RA headend device to configure the following:
Configure IPsec ciphers.
crypto ipsec transform-set sdwan-ra_transform_se ipsec-cipher 
mode tunnel 
Example:
crypto ipsec transform-set sdwan-ra_ipsec_ts esp-gcm 256
mode tunnel
Configure IPsec parameters.
crypto ipsec profile sdwan-ra_ipsec_profile 
set transform-set sdwan-ra_transform_set 
set security-association lifetime seconds ipsec_sa_life_sec  
set security-association replay window-size window-size 
set ikev2-profile sdwan-ra_ikev2_profile 
Example:
crypto ipsec profile sdwan-ra_ipsec-profile
 set security-association lifetime seconds 33600
 set security-association replay window-size 64 
 set transform-set sdwan-ra_transform_set
 set ikev2-profile sdwan-ra_ikev2_profile
Configure the IPsec virtual-template interface.
interface Virtual-Templatesdwan-ra_unnum_intf_num type tunnel 
 vrf forwarding sdwan-ra_service_vpn 
 ip address private_ipv4_addr subnet_mask 
interface Virtual-Templatesdwan-ra_vt_intf_num type tunnel

interface Virtual-Template100 type tunnel
 vrf forwarding sdwan-ra_service_vpn
 ip address 10.0.0.100 255.255.255.0
!
interface Virtual-Template101 type tunnel
 vrf forwarding sdwan-ra_service_vpn
 tunnel mode ipsec ipv4
 tunnel protection ipsec profile sdwan-ra_ipsec-profile
Task 5: Configure AnyConnect Profile Download
Before You Begin
Ensure that you have an AnyConnect profile XML file available. Step 3 uses the file. For information about AnyConnect profiles, see the documentation for AnyConnect.
Configure AnyConnect Profile Download
In Cisco vManage, use a CLI add-on template for the SD-WAN RA headend device to configure the following:
Disable HTTP secure server functionality.
no ip http secure-server 
Configure SSL policy and specify the Cisco SD-WAN RA WAN IP as the local address for profile download.
crypto ssl policy sdra_anyconnect_profile_download 
 pki trustpoint sdra_pki_trustpoint  sign 
 ip address local sdra_wan_ip port 443 
Copy the AnyConnect profile XML file to the SDRA headend bootflash and specify the path.

Note
You can copy the AnyConnect profile XML file to the Cisco SD-WAN RA headend bootflash from a host reachable in a service VPN, using the secure copy command on the Cisco SD-WAN RA headend.
crypto vpn anyconnect profile sdra_anyconnect_profile  bootflash: sdra_anyconnect_profile.xml 
Specify the AnyConnect profile name in the IKEv2 profile.
crypto ikev2 profile sdra_ikev2_profile 
 anyconnect profile sdra_anyconnect_profile 
Example:
no ip http secure-server
!
crypto ssl policy sdra_anyconnect_profile_download
 pki trustpoint sdra_pki_trustpoint sign
 ip address local 172.16.1.1 port 443
!
crypto vpn anyconnect profile sdra_anyconnect_profile bootflash: sdra_anyconnect_profile.xml
!
crypto ikev2 profile sdra_ikev2_profile
anyconnect profile sdra_anyconnect_profile
Task 6: Configure a Unique Local Private IP Pool on the SD-WAN RA Headend

Note
This task is optional if all RA users connect to the headend by hardware RA client.
Configure each SD-WAN RA headend with a unique private IP pool from which to assign IP addresses to RA clients. The IP pool can be shared across the service VPNs in which RA clients connect to the SD-WAN RA headend.
Configure a Unique Local Private IP Pool on the Cisco SD-WAN RA Headend
In Cisco vManage, use a CLI add-on template for the SD-WAN RA headend device to configure the local IP pool. Ensure that the IP pool range is sufficient for the expected number of RA connections.
ip local pool sdra-ip-pool ip-address-range-start ip-address-address-end 
Example:
ip local pool sdra_ip_pool 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.100
On the RADIUS server, configure the per-user or group policy to specify the IP pool name configured in the previous step.
Optionally, for each RA service VPN, use a Cisco vManage OMP feature template to advertise the RA IP pool range as a summary-only route.
If the SD-WAN RA IP pool summary is not advertised, OMP automatically advertises, for each RA client, static host routes that are dynamically programmed by the SD-WAN RA headend. This may not be optimal if there is a large number of RA clients across the Cisco SD-WAN fabric.
Task 7: Configure AAA Parameters and RADIUS Server Parameters
In Cisco vManage, use a CLI add-on template for the SD-WAN RA headend device to configure the following:
Configure RADIUS server parameters.
aaa new-model  
aaa group server radius sdra_radius_grp 
server-private radius-ip key encr_key 
ip vrf forwarding radius-vrf 
Configure AAA method lists for authentication, authorization and accounting.
aaa authentication login sdra_authen_mlist group sdra_radius_grp 
aaa authorization network sdra_author_mlist group sdra_radius_grp 
aaa accounting network sdra_acc_mlist group sdra_radius_group 
Example:
aaa new-model
aaa group server radius sdra_radius_group
server-private 10.0.8.100 key sdra-encr-key 
ip vrf forwarding 1
!
aaa authentication login sdra_authen_mlist group sdra_radius_grp
aaa authorization network sdra_author_mlist group sdra_radius_grp
aaa accounting network sdra_acc_mlist group sdra_radius_group
Task 8: Configure the RADIUS Server with User Credentials and Policy
Before You Begin
This task requires a working knowledge of RADIUS server configuration.
Configure the RADIUS Server with User Credentials and Policy
The SD-WAN RA headend relies on the RADIUS server as the repository of RA user authentication credentials, and of policy configuration details, such as VRF, security group tag (SGT), IP pool name, and server subnets. Using the RADIUS server for these functions is preferable to trying to manage credential and policy configuration on each RA headend device, as the RADIUS server centralizes this configuration and provides scalability.
The RADIUS server also functions as an extensible authentication protocol (EAP) server when RA clients use the EAP authentication method.
To support the SD-WAN RA headend, ensure that the following parameters are configured on the RADIUS server. These parameters are required for enabling RA connections:
User authentication credentials
Username and password for AnyConnect-EAP connections
Pre-shared keys for the pre-shared key authentication method
EAP credentials for EAP authentication method
Policy parameters that apply to a user or to a user group
VRF: Service VPN that the RA user is assigned to
IP pool name: Name of the IP pool defined on the RA headend
Server subnets: Subnet access to provide to the RA user
SGT: Trustsec SGT tag to assign to the user traffic
For full configuration information, see the RADIUS documentation. For a list of supported attributes, see FlexVPN RADIUS Attributes.
For reference, see the following subset of RADIUS parameters. These parameters are required, to enable SD-WAN RA to establish RA connections.
Table 1. Subset of the Parameters in a User Profile
Parameter
Description
Profile name
RA user identity.
Example:
user1@example.com
Cleartext-password := "password"
RA user password specified by the RA user on the RA client.
This is required for AnyConnect EAP authentication.
Tunnel-Password = pre-shared-key-string
Pre-shared-key string to use for the RA user.
This is required for pre-shared key authentication.
cisco-avpair+="ip:interface-config=vrf forwarding vrf-name"
VRF (service VPN) that the RA user is assigned to.
Prerequisite: Define the VRF locally on the headend.
cisco-avpair+="ip:interface-config=ip unnumbered interface-name"
The IP unnumbered interface for the virtual-template and virtual-access interfaces.
Prerequisite: On the SD-WAN RA headend, configure the interface to use for RA, and a private IP address, preferably from the IP pool subnet range.
The SD-WAN RA headend re-uses the private IP address described above for virtual-template and per-RA-user virtual-access interfaces.
Note
  If the VRF attribute is configured in a RADIUS profile, then the ip numbered interface attribute must also be configured after the VRF attribute.
Framed-Pool=pool-name
Name of the IP pool, defined on the headend, that the RA headend uses to assign an IP address to the RA user.
cisco-avpair+="ipsec:route-set=prefix prefix/prefix-length"
IP prefixes to which the RA user requires access over the RA VPN tunnel.
You can configure this attribute multiple times to specify multiple prefixes.
cisco-avpair+="ip:interface-config=cts role-based sgt-map sgt sgt-value"
The SGT to assign to the traffic from this RA user that is destined to a Cisco SD-WAN tunnel.
Table 2. Subset of the Parameters in a User Group Profile
Parameter
Description
Group profile name
Domain portion of the RA user identity.
The group profile enables grouping of RA users based on the domain portion of the RA user identity. Grouping enables you to specify common policy parameters.
Specifying example.com would include in the group any user with example.com domain after the @ character.
The RADIUS server applies the parameters specified in this group profile to any users included in this group.
Cleartext-password := "password"
For an authorization request from RA headend to the RADIUS server, the password is configured on the RA headend as part of the authorization command in IKEv2 profile.
If the password is not configured, the default password is cisco .
cisco-avpair+="ip:interface-config=vrf forwarding vrf-name"
VRF (service VPN) that the group of RA users is assigned to.
Prerequisite: Define the VRF locally on the headend.
cisco-avpair+="ip:interface-config=ip unnumbered interface-name"
The IP unnumbered interface for the virtual-template and virtual-access interfaces.
Prerequisite: On the SD-WAN RA headend, configure the interface to use for RA, and a private IP address, preferably from the IP pool subnet range.
The SD-WAN RA headend re-uses the private IP address described above for virtual-template and per-RA-user virtual-access interfaces.
Note
  If the VRF attribute is configured in a RADIUS profile, then the ip numbered interface attribute must also be configured after the VRF attribute.
Framed-Pool=pool-name
Name of the IP pool, defined on the headend, that the RA headend uses to assign IP addresses to this group of RA users.
cisco-avpair+="ipsec:route-set=prefix prefix/prefix-length"
IP prefixes to which the group of RA users require access over the RA VPN tunnel.
You can configure this attribute multiple times to specify multiple prefixes.
Task 9: Configure RA Traffic Rate Limiting
You can limit the rate of the aggregate upstream and downstream aggregate RA traffic by applying quality of service (QoS) policers and shapers.
Configure RA Traffic Rate Limiting
Rate limit RA upstream traffic (from the RA client).

Note
The upstream traffic may be destined to Cisco SD-WAN sites such as the SD-WAN RA headend, a data center LAN, or the internet.
Use one or both of the following options to rate limit to the required rate.
For encrypted upstream traffic: Using Cisco vManage, add an inbound QoS policer on the SD-WAN RA WAN interface, using the local data policy (access list), to rate limit encrypted upstream traffic.
Rate limiting encrypted traffic drops excess RA traffic, irrespective of the traffic destination, RA client type, or application type.
Configure the following match conditions and action:
Match IKEv2 and encrypted IPsec traffic. Include the following:
UDP ports 500 and 4500
IP protocol ESP
Action: Configure the required rate for the policing.
For decrypted upstream traffic: Using Cisco vManage, add an inbound QoS policer on the SD-WAN RA WAN interface, using the centralized data policy, to rate limit decrypted upstream traffic.
When rate limiting decrypted traffic, you can specify RA clients and application types.

Note
SD-WAN RA places an RA user in a service VPN based on the user identity. After decryption, the traffic from an RA user is treated as inbound traffic from the VPN of the RA user.
Configure the following match conditions and action:
Match RA inner (within the IPsec tunnel) traffic. Specify the following:
RA user service VPN
For the source IP, specify the IP address(es) assigned to the RA client.
Application
Action: Configure the required rate for the policing.
Using Cisco vManage, add an inbound QoS policer to the centralized policy to rate limit RA downstream (toward the RA client) traffic.
The traffic may originate from sources such as traffic from the site where the SD-WAN RA headend is located, a data center LAN, software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications, or the internet.
Effect: This step rate limits the enterprise and internet (including SaaS) RA return traffic as close as possible to the traffic source (application server). When rate limiting unencrypted traffic, you can specify RA clients and application types.
Configure the following match conditions and action:
Match RA inner (within the IPsec tunnel) traffic. Specify the following:
RA user service VPN
For the destination IP, specify the IP address(es) assigned to the RA client.
Application
Action: Configure the required rate for the policing.
For information, see Cisco SD-WAN Forwarding and QoS Configuration Guide, Cisco IOS XE Release 17.x.
Task 10: Configure RA Traffic Symmetry
At Cisco SD-WAN sites with multiple Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices acting as SD-WAN RA headends, you must ensure RA traffic symmetry (both directions of a flow using the same path) to enable return traffic to be correctly routed to RA clients.
A. Configure RA Traffic Symmetry for Sites That Use VRRP
At a site with multiple Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices functioning as SD-WAN RA headends, and with a LAN that uses the virtual router redundancy protocol (VRRP), use this procedure to ensure RA traffic symmetry and retrun traffic reachability.
Figure 1. Site With Service-Side VRRP
Ensure that each SD-WAN RA headend has a unique local private IP pool (RA IP pool) for assigning IP addresses to RA clients. RA clients use the assigned private IP as the source IP for all inner (within the IPsec tunnel) traffic.
On each SD-WAN RA headend, in each of the end user service VPNs, add a static route to the RA IP pool of each of the neighbor SD-WAN RA headends. For the static route, configure the corresponding SD-WAN RA headend as the next hop.
The effect of this step is that if there is an asymmetric traffic flow, where return traffic arrives at a different device at the site than forward traffic, the static route forwards the traffic to the correct SD-WAN RA headend device, which is the headend device with the IPsec tunnel and host route to the RA client.
Example:
In the example shown in the figure, there are two SD-WAN RA headend devices (SDRA-1 and SDRA-2) at the same site. They are interconnected with a service VPN. Each has a unique local IP pool.
On SDRA-1, configure a static route as follows:
Route destination: SDRA-2 IP pool subnet
Route next-hop: SDRA-2 service VPN IP
On SDRA-2, configure a static route as follows:
Route destination: SDRA-1 IP pool subnet
Route next-hop: SDRA-1 service VPN IP
B. Configure RA Traffic Symmetry for Sites That Use Routing Protocols
At a site with multiple Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices functioning as SD-WAN RA headends, and with a LAN that uses routing protocols such as open shortest path first (OSPF) or enhanced interior gateway routing protocol (EIGRP), use this procedure to ensure RA traffic symmetry and retrun traffic reachability.
Figure 2. Site With Service-Side Routing Protocol
Ensure that each SD-WAN RA headend has a unique local private IP pool for assigning IP addresses to RA clients (RA IP pool). RA clients use the assigned private IP as the source IP for all inner (within the IPsec tunnel) traffic.
On each SD-WAN RA headend, redistribute the RA IP pool into the service side routing protocol, so that the LAN-side router/L3 switch forwards any return traffic destined to RA clients to the correct device, based on the assigned IP address (return traffic destination IP).
Task 11: Configure Cisco SD-WAN Features for RA Traffic
When the SD-WAN RA headend establishes a connection with an RA user, it places the user in a service VPN based on the identity of the RA user. After the RA traffic is decrypted, it becomes inbound traffic on the assigned service VPN. The Cisco SD-WAN features that are configured for the service VPN apply to the RA traffic also. These feature include the following:
NAT-DIA
UTD
ZBF
Configure Cisco SD-WAN Features for RA Traffic
Ensure that each service VPN is configured with the Cisco SD-WAN features that you want to apply to the RA traffic that uses that service VPN.
Configure SD-WAN Remote Access Using Cisco vManage
Before You Begin
Global private IP pool for SD-WAN Remote Access: In the network hierarchy, define a global private IPv4 pool and IPv6 pool for remote access. Ensure that this pool address range is unique in the Cisco SD-WAN overlay.
This global private IP pool for remote access is used to allocate a unique IP pool to each device enabled for remote access. The devices use the allocated pool to assign a unique IP address to each remote access client. The remote access clients use the assigned IP address as the source IP address of the traffic from the client that is sent over an encrypted tunnel to the device.
Certificate authority: Define the certificate authority for SD-WAN Remote Access. The devices enabled for remote access receive a certificate from this certificate authority. The devices use the certificate to authenticate to remote access clients.
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Certificate Authority and select Enterprise CA and Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP).

Note
The other CA options such as Enterprise CA without SCEP, Cisco vManage as CA and Cisco vManage as intermediate CA are not supported for the SD-WAN Remote Access feature.
RADIUS server: Define a RADIUS server in a configuration group using the AAA feature profile in the System Profile. The devices enabled for remote access use the RADIUS server to authenticate and to fetch an authorization policy for remote access clients.
Configure the authentication and authorization policies and the attributes on the RADIUS server.
Default service VPN for SD-WAN Remote Access: Select one of the service VPNs as the default service VPN for remote access. The connection from each remote access client is placed in this service VPN unless the authorization policy from the RADIUS server specifies a different service VPN.
Configure SD-WAN Remote Access
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Workflows > Create Configuration Group.
Enter the configuration group name and the description in the Name and Description fields.
Click Next.
The Additional Features page opens.
Enable Remote Access.
For Radius Server Address, enter the IP address of the RADIUS server.
For Radius Server Key, enter the RADIUS server key.
Choose the service VPN to reach the RADIUS server from the Select Service VPN drop-down list.
Click Create Configuration Group.
Cisco vManage creates a new configuration group with the SD-WAN Remote Access feature enabled. The Remote Access feature profile appears in the System Profile.
For information about working with configuration groups, see Configuration Groups and Feature Profiles.
Add the SD-WAN Remote Access Feature Profile to an Existing Configuration Group
From the Cisco vManage menu, choose Configuration > Configuration Groups
Select an existing configuration group and select Edit.
Select Feature Profiles > Service Profile > VPN
Select one of the service VPNs and select Edit Feature under Actions.
In Basic Configuration, select Enable SDWAN Remote Acces.
Select Feature Profiles > System Profile > Add Feature > Remote Access.
For information about working with configuration groups, see Configuration Groups and Feature Profiles.
