Introduction
This document describes the new ISE Passive Identity Connector (ISE-PIC) Agent that was introduced in the ISE 3.0 version, its advantages, and the configuration of this agent on the ISE. ISE Passive Identity agent has become an integral part of the Identity Firewall solution using Cisco FirePower Management Center as well.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:

Cisco Identity Services Administration
MS-RPC, WMI Protocols
Active Directory Administration
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
Cisco Identity Services Engine version 3.0 and above
Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Standard

The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command.

Need for a New Protocol
ISE's Passive Identity (Passive ID) feature drives a number of important use cases including Identity-Based Firewall, EasyConnect, etc. This feature depends on the ability to monitor users logging into Active Directory Domain Controllers and learning their username and IP addresses. The current main protocol we use to monitor the Domain Controllers is WMI. However, It is hard/invasive to configure, has a performance impact on both clients and servers, and sometimes has extremely large latency in seeing logon events in scaled deployments. After thorough research and alternative ways to poll the information required for Passive Identity Services, an alternative protocol - known as the EVT or Eventing API, which is more efficient in handling this use case was decided upon. It is sometimes referred to as MS-EVEN6, also known as Eventing Remote Protocol, which is the underlying RPC-based on-the-wire protocol.
Advantages with the Use of MS-EVEN6
High Availability
The original agent had no High Availability option and if it is needed to do maintenance on the server where the agent was running or had an outage, logon events would be missed and features like Identity-based Firewall would see a loss of data during this period. This is one of the major concerns with the use of ISE PIC Agent prior to this release. ISE uses UDP Port 9095 to exchange heartbeats between the agents.
Scalability
The new agent provides better support with increased scale numbers for a supported number of domain controllers and the number of events that it can handle. Here are the scale numbers that were tested :
Maximum number of domain controllers monitored (With 2 pairs of Agents): 74
Maximum number of Mappings/events tested: 292,000 (3950 events per DC)
Maximum TPS tested: 500
Scale Test Setup Architecture
Historic Events Query
In case of Failover or in case of a service restart is done for the PIC-Agent, to ensure that no data is lost, events that are generated for the past given amount of time are queried and sent to the PSN nodes again. By default, 60 seconds worth of past events from the start of the service are queried by the ISE to negate any loss of data during the service loss.
Less Processing Overhead
Unlike WMI which is CPU intense under large scale or heavy load, EVT does not consume that many resources as does WMI. The scale tests showed a much-improved performance of the queries with the use of EVT.

Configurations
Configure ISE for PassiveID Agent
In order to configure PassiveID services, one must have the Passive Identity Services enabled on at least one Policy Service Node (PSN). A maximum of two nodes can be used for Passive Identity Services which functions in Active/Standby mode of operation. ISE must also be joined to an Active Directory domain and only those domain controllers present in that domain can be monitored by Agents configured on the ISE. In order to join ISE to an Active Directory domain, refer to the Active Directory Integration Guide.
Navigate to Administration > System > Deployment > [Choose a PSN]  > Edit to enable Passive Identity Services as shown here :
Navigate to Work Centers > PassiveID > Providers > Agents > Add to deploy a new Agent as show here :
Note: 1. If the agent is planned to be installed by ISE on the Domain controller, the account used here must have privileges sufficient enough to install a program and run it on the server mentioned in the Host FQDN field. The Host FQDN here can be that of a member server instead of a domain controller.

          2. If an agent is already installed manually or from a previous deployment from the ISE, with MSRPC, the permissions and configurations needed on the Active Directory or Windows side are fewer compared to WMI, the other protocol (and the only one available prior to 3.0) used by PIC agents. The user account used in this case can be a regular domain account which is part of Event Log Readers group. Choose Register Existing Agent and use these account details to register the agent which is manually installed on the domain controllers.
After a successful deployment, configure another agent on a different server and add it as a secondary agent and then its primary peer as shown in this image.
 In order to monitor the domain controllers using the agents, Navigate to Work Centers > PassiveID > Providers > Active Directory > [Click on the Join Point] > PassiveID . Click on Add DCs and choose the domain controllers from which the User-IP Mapping/events are retrieved and click OK and then click Save to save the changes, as shown in this image.
In order to specify the Agents which should be used to retrieve the events from, Navigate to Work Centers > PassiveID > Providers > Active Directory > [Click on the Join Point] > PassiveID. Choose the domain controllers and click Edit. Enter the User Name and Password. Choose Agent and then Save the dialogue box. Click on Save on the PassiveID tab to complete the configuration.
One can check if the configuration is correctly applied with the help of the Configure and Test buttons as shown in the images here:
Understand PassiveID Agent Configuration File
The PassiveID Agent configuration file is located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Cisco\Cisco ISE PassiveID Agent\PICAgent.exe.config . The configuration file has content shown here :
