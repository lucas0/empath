Overview of Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine
Network operators are facing challenges to support the exponential growth of network traffic while addressing the pressure to efficiently run network operations. They need a toolset to help automate bandwidth optimization and efficiently steer traffic with little operator intervention. Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine fulfills this need by providing real-time network optimization capabilities that allow operators to effectively maximize network utility as well as increase service velocity.
Looking at the following figure, Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine is built to fulfill the need for a closed-loop optimization loop as described under “Near Real-Time Feedback Loop”. Through Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine, the operator is able to define the optimization intent, implement the intent, and continuously monitor, track, and react to maintain the original intent.
Figure 1. Network Resolution Lifecycle
Real-time Visibility
To run their network effectively, end-to-end visibility is important to any network operator. Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine not only provides this visibility, but also the ability to visualize the network across different layers (optical to IP) and the relationship between each layer. Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine leverages IETF-standard BGP-LS protocol to discover IP network automatically, including the following features:
Real-time visibility: Provides the network operator with a true representation of the actual topology
Hierarchical topology view: Enables operators to define the different levels of granularity in the topology visualization
Simplified SR-TE Policy and RSVP-TE Tunnel Lifecycle Management
Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine also provides an easy to use UI and API to manage and monitor the TE tunnel lifecycle. The UI and API enables the network operator to perform the following tasks:
Visualize SR-TE (SR-MPLS and SRv6) policies and RSVP-TE tunnels.
Create, modify, and remove SR-MPLS policies and RSVP-TE tunnels using an intuitive workflow
Continuously track SR-MPLS policies and RSVP-TE tunnels and use dynamic path computations to maintain SLA objectives
Preview an SR-MPLS policy or RSVP-TE tunnel before deploying it to the network
Extensibility through Feature Packs
Crosswork Optimization Engine feature packs provide congestion mitigation and closed loop bandwidth optimization. A user defines the bandwidth optimization intent and the tools implement the intent, and continuously monitor, track, and react to maintain the original intent. A user can also define network congestion thresholds and configure whether to have the tool automatically remediate congestion or provide mitigation suggestions the operator can choose to act upon.
Due to licensing or the configuration of the role associated with your user account, you may not be able to access all of the features and functions. For licensing and ordering information, work with your Cisco Partner or Cisco Sales representative to review options described in the "Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine Ordering Guide".
What's New in Release 4.1.0
This section lists new features and changes delivered in Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine 4.1. For system requirements information, see the Cisco Crosswork Infrastructure and Application Installation Guide.
Table 2. New Features and Functionality in Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine 4.1
Feature
What's New?
Segment Routing Tree Segment Identifier (Tree-SID) Visualization
You can now visualize Tree-SID policies implemented in a network that uses the Segment Routing Path Computation Element (SR-PCE) using path computation element protocol (PCEP). You can view the Tree-SID details of the root, transit, leaf, and bud nodes. Visualization provides an easier way to confirm that Tree-SID is implemented correctly in your network.
Note
  Visualization of Tree-SID policies are supported on PCEs running IOS XR 7.7.1. If there are devices running other versions in the network, Tree-SID visualization will not work.
Traffic Engineering Dashboard
Crosswork Optimization Engine now supports TE Dashboard that provides a summary of SR-MPLS, RSVP-TE tunnel, SRv6, and Tree-SID policy information.
To view the historical data, from the main menu, choose Traffic Engineering > Traffic Engineering.
For every policy/tunnel, there is a new Historical Data tab that displays the traffic history and the path and state change event for the same. TE Dashboard also shows underutilized policies and top 'n' policies by events.
The configuration for TE affinity, and unused utilization threshold can be found in Administration > Settings > Traffic Engineering.
Policy and Tunnel Provisioning
Policy and tunnel provisioning preview details have been updated with more details and topology map enhancements.
Only PCC nodes that have a PCEP session with the PCE are available for headend selection.
SRv6 Support
IPv6 router ID and IPv6 SID information (when available) are now displayed in SRv6, SR-MPLS, RSVP, Tree SID policy details.
Different IGP/TE metrics may be used for each interface for IPv4 and IPv6.
For TE optimized IPv6 routing, IPv6 link metrics are used if it exists, otherwise IPv4 link metrics are used. The following metrics are used in order of preference:
IPv6 TE
IPv6 IGP
IPv4 TE
IPv4 IGP
Flexible Algorithm Support
You can now provision dynamic SR-MPLS policies to use a SID Algorithm constraint. For more information, see Create Dynamic SR-MPLS Policies Based on Optimization Intent.
The Flexible Algorithm SID attribute associated with each candidate path is displayed in the SR Policy table and in the policy details. To view the SID in the SR Policy table, you must enable the SID Algorithm column to show in the table.
Global PCE Maximum Latency Support
Crosswork now supports the global maximum latency value that is set manually on the PCE (via the CLI or NETCONF). For example:
Device-IOS-XR-771(config-pce)#constraints bounds cumulative type latency <max-latency-value>
If this value is configured on the device, then the SR-PCE will only allow LSPs within the threshold. This feature applies to dynamic policies with the metric type set to Latency. This is useful for advanced network users who are interested in paths with a lower latency.
Note
  For BWoD:
Only PCC-initiated policies are supported.
SR-PCE and PCC nodes must be running Cisco IOS XR 7.7.1.
Local Mitigation Congestion (LCM)
A new Stay in Area option restricts bypass LSP paths to stay within the mitigated area for OSPF or levels for ISIS.
The minimum value for the Congestion Check Interval has been changed to 60 seconds.
Instead of having to manually find LCM deployed policies, you can now click on a deployed policy from the LCM Operational Dashboard, and it will only display the deployed SR policies topology.
The Link Management page has been updated and renamed to Interface Thresholds. In addition to importing a CSV file containing interface thresholds, you can now add individual interface thresholds on the Interface Thresholds page.
A new advanced Maximum Segment Hops option allows you to specify a custom Maximum SID Depth (MSD) constraint to use for up to 5 device tag groups. When calculating bypass TTE policies, LCM uses the effective MSD available value (as entered in the LCM Configuration page) for the assigned device tag groups.
Crosswork Optimization Engine learns from SR-PCE the MSD for each platform advertising the hardware limit in the IGP and BGP-LS. It represents the hardware limit that can be imposed exclusive of any service/transport/special labels. Therefore, you may want to use this new option to assign less than the advertised MSD value that LCM can use for bypass TTE policy calculation.
Note
  To view the MSD value for a device, navigate to the Traffic Engineering topology map and click on the device. From the Device Details page, and click SR-MPLS > Prefixes tab > Expand All.
A new advanced Uneven ECMP Traffic Threshold option allows you to enter the percentage of sensitivity to detect uneven amounts of traffic across solution bypass tunnels.
When LCM detects no measured traffic (typically due to the “Profile ID” not being properly configured), then the LCM solution is marked as “degraded”.
For more information, see Configure LCM.
Device PCEP Session Details
Device PCEP session information is now displayed in the Device Details page (Traffic Engineering topology map > device-icon > Details tab).
Bandwidth on Demand (BWoD)
Extended existing support for MSDs to PCC-initiated BWoD policies. BWoD now computes a path to comply with the manually configured MSD constraint (sid-limit) on the headend router.
Device Grouping
Device group visualization enhancements have been made.
For more information, see View Device Group to Filter you Topolygy View.
Multivendor Support
You now have the ability to customize Device Package templates to support certain vendor specific traffic statistics. Contact your Cisco Crosswork Customer Experience representative for details.
APIs
The following API features have been updated:
Feature Packs—Extended LCM and Flexible Algorithm support.
SRv6:
Further support of IPv6 Router IDs
Support for discovery and reporting of IPv6 Link-Local style links

Upgrade Crosswork Optimization Engine Feature Packs
If you have enabled feature packs (LCM, Bandwidth Optimization, or BWoD) in Crosswork Optimization Engine 4.0 and want to upgrade to Crosswork Optimization Engine 4.1, you must perform the following tasks prior to upgrading:
LCM and Bandwidth Optimization (BWOpt)
From the LCM or Bandwidth Optimization Configuration page:
Set the Delete Tactical SR Policies when Disabled option to False. This task must be done prior to disabling LCM or BWOpt so that tactical polices deployed by LCM or BWOpt remain in the network after the upgrade.
Set the Enable option to False. If LCM or BWOpt remains enabled, there is a chance that tactical policies may be deleted after the upgrade.
Note all options (Basic and Advanced) in the LCM or BWOpt Configuration page so that you can confirm the same configuration has been migrated after the upgrade.
Export the current list of interfaces managed by LCM or BWOpt (Traffic Engineering > Local Congestion Mitigation or Bandwidth Optimization > Interface Threshold > Export icon). Confirm the interfaces are valid by reimporting the CSV file without errors. For more information, see "Add Individual Interface Thresholds" in the Cisco Crosswork Optimization Engine 4.1 User Guide.
After the upgrade, wait until the Traffic Engineering page shows all the nodes and links before enabling LCM or BWOpt.
Note:
After the system is stable and before enabling domains for LCM, confirm that the migration of previously monitored interfaces has completed and that each domain has the expected configuration options.
Navigate to Administration > Alarms > All > Events and enter LCM to filter the Source column.
Look for the following event: "Migration complete. All migrated LCM interfaces and policies are mapped to their IGP domains". If this message does not appear wait for the Congestion Check Interval period (set in the LCM Configuration page), then restart LCM (Administration > Crosswork Manager > Optimization Engine > optima-lcm > ... > Restart).
Wait until the optima-lcm service changes from Degraded to Healthy state.
For each domain, navigate to the Configuration page and verify the options have been migrated successfully. If the domain configurations are incorrect, restart LCM (Administration > Crosswork Manager > Optimization Engine > optima-lcm > ... > Restart).
Check the Events page for the event mentioned above and the Configuration page to verify the options.

Note
If the confirmation message does not appear or domain configuration options are incorrect, then contact Cisco Technical support and provide them with showtech information and the exported Link Management CSV file.
You can also manually add missing interfaces that were previously monitored or update domain configuration options after the system is stable.
BWoD
Set the Enable option to False. If BWoD remains enabled, there is a chance that tactical policies may be deleted after the upgrade.
Note all options (Basic and Advanced) in the BWoD Configuration page so that you can confirm the same configuration has been migrated after the upgrade.
After the upgrade, wait until the Traffic Engineering page shows all the nodes and links before enabling BWoD.
