Summary
Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read arbitrary files or conduct a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack through an affected device. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must have valid Administrator credentials on the affected device.
For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.
Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

Affected Products
Vulnerable Products
At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected Cisco ISE.
For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.
Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.
Details
The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.
Note: These vulnerabilities can be exploited only by valid and authorized users of the Cisco ISE system. As a best practice, customers can restrict console access and admin web access. To configure the access restrictions, choose Administration > System > Admin Access > Settings > Access > IP Access.
Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:
CVE-2023-20173: Cisco Identity Services Engine XML External Entity Injection Vulnerability
A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system of an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have valid Administrator level privileges on the affected device.
This vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted XML file that contains references to external entities. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve files from the local system, resulting in the disclosure of confidential information.
Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

CVE-2023-20174: Cisco Identity Services Engine XML External Entity Injection Vulnerability
A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack through an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have valid Administrator level privileges on the affected device.
This vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted XML file that contains references to external entities. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send arbitrary network requests that are sourced from the affected system.
Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.
