Exceptional Performance with Flexible Deployments
Get wire-rate, Layer 2 and Layer 3 switching with a comprehensive feature set, including Cisco Algo Boost technology, with the lowest latency in the industry. The Cisco Nexus 3548-X and XL Switches, part of the Unified Fabric Family, is well suited for mainstream top-of-rack, (ToR) data center deployments. It comes in a compact, 1-rack-unit (1 RU) form factor.
Features and capabilities
Algo Boost technology allows the Cisco Nexus 3548-X and XL to achieve exceptionally low latencies of 250 nanoseconds (ns) or less for all workloads. That includes unicast and multicast, and Layer 2 and 3 switching, regardless of the features applied.
Benefits include:
Multicast NAT and latency monitoring leading to simplified co-location integration and enhanced traffic visibility and troubleshooting
Warp mode to further reduce latency to 190 ns for small to midsize Layer 2 and 3 deployments
Warp SPAN to help enable stock market data delivery to trading servers in as little as 50 ns
Active Buffer Monitoring to help you take advantage of market volatility and handle micro bursts
Technology that supports Network Address Translation (NAT) for trade execution on any venue, without a latency penalty
Embedded Remote SPAN with nanosecond timestamps to help you monitor your traffic with superior precision
Next-generation 3548-X offers lower power consumption further lowering operational cost
