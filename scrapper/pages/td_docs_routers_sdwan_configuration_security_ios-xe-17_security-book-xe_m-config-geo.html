Geolocation-Based Firewall Rules for Allowing or Denying Network Traffic Based on Geolocation
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.5.1a
Cisco vManage Release 20.5.1
This feature enables you to configure firewall rules for allowing or denying network traffic based on the source and destination location instead of IP addresses.
This feature adds a new object group, geo, where you can specify countries and continents as objects in an Access Control List (ACL). An object group ACL simplifies policy creation in large networks, especially if the ACL changes frequently.
New object-group and geo commands were added.

Overview of Geolocation-Based Firewall Rules
Geolocation-based firewall rules allow you to configure firewall rules for allowing or denying network traffic based on the specified source and destination locations.
A third-party database is used for geolocation-to-IP-address mapping. Use the geo database update command to update the geolocation database periodically to pick up the latest changes.
After you configure a geolocation-based firewall rule by specifying source and destination locations in Cisco SD-WAN Manager, the geolocation database is automatically enabled in the CLI. Alternatively, you can use the geo database command to enable the geolocation database.
For more information on the CLI commands, see Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Qualified Command Reference.
This feature adds a new object group geo , where you can specify countries and continents as objects to use in Access Control Lists (ACLs). The new geo object group is then used in the ACL to enable geolocation-based firewall rules.
The geo object group is a collection of the following types of objects:
Three-letter country code objects
Two-letter continent code objects
An object group can contain a single object or multiple objects. You can nest other geolocation object groups using the group-object command.

Note
You cannot configure nested geo object groups in Cisco SD-WAN Manager. You can configure nested geo object groups using only the CLI.
Data packets are classified using geolocation-based firewall rules instead of using IP addresses. When classifying the data packet, if a firewall rule has a geolocation-based filter, an IP address lookup occurs against the geolocation database to determine which country or continent is associated with the IP address.
Use-Case Scenario
A client (192.168.11.10) in a local area network (LAN) initiates traffic over Dedicated Internet Access (DIA) to a destination IP addresses belonging to France (FRA) and Germany (GBR). As per the security firewall policy, traffic to France should be inspected and that to Germany should be dropped.
Benefits of Geolocation-Based Firewall Rules
You can restrict access to particular countries without needing to know the associated IP addresses for those countries.
A geolocation can be a country, a continent, or a list containing both continents and countries.

Note
After you have chosen a continent in a security firewall rule, all IP addresses belonging to that particular continent code are inspected as part of the security firewall rule.
You can add multiple geolocation lists or geolocations using a single policy.
When you update a geo object group, all the policies that use that geo object group are automatically updated.
Prerequisites for Geo Object Groups
To associate a geo object with an ACL, the geo object group must be already defined with at least one object.
Restrictions for Geo Object Groups
Empty geo object groups are not supported. Any empty geo object group is deleted in exiting global configuration mode. You cannot associate an empty object group with an ACL.

Note
An empty geo object group is a geo object group that does not contain any references to countries. To empty a geo object group, you need to remove any references to countries within the geo object group.
As long as a geo object group is in use inside the corresponding ACL or nested in another group, it can neither be deleted nor emptied.
A geo object group can be associated only with extended IPv4 ACLs and not with IPv4 standard ACLs.
Configure Geolocation-Based Firewall Rules
To configure firewall rules, specify the source and destination locations in the security firewall policies in Cisco SD-WAN Manager.
There are two ways to configure geofiltering using Cisco SD-WAN Manager:
Configure a geolocation list using Configuration > Security > Custom Options.
Create or add a geolocation list or a geolocation to an existing firewall security policy.
Prerequisite: You must have an existing security policy for the second bullet item.

Note
If you add a geolocation list, you cannot add a geolocation.
Conversely, if you add a geolocation, you cannot add a geolocation list.

Note
You cannot configure both a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) and a geo as a source data prefix and as a destination data prefix.
Configure a Geolocation List Using Configuration > Security > Custom Options
From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Configuration > Security.
From the Custom Options drop-down menu, choose Lists.
Click Geo Location in the left pane.
Click New Geo Location List.
Enter a name for the geolocation list.
Choose one or more geolocations from the drop-down menu.

Note
If you choose a continent, you cannot choose any of the countries that are part of the continent. If you want to choose a list of countries, choose the appropriate countries from the list.
Click Add.
Create a Geolocation List or Add a Geolocation to an Existing Security Firewall Policy
From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Configuration > Security.
Choose an existing security policy.
For the chosen policy, click ..., and click Edit.
The Edit Security Policy window displays.
Click Firewall.
For the desired policy you want to modify, click ... and click Edit.
The Edit Firewall Policy window displays.
Click Add Rule/Rule Set Rule.
From the drop-down menu, choose Add Rule.
The New Firewall window displays.
Click Source Data Prefix to add a source geolocation list or new geolocations.
From the Geo Location List drop-down menu, choose a previously configured geolocation list.
Alternatively, to create a new geolocation list, choose New Geo Location.
The Geo Location List dialog box displays.
In the Geo Location List Name field, specify a name for the geolocation list.
From the Select Geo Location drop-down menu, choose one or more locations.
Click Save.
From the Geo Location drop-down menu, choose one or more locations.
Click Save.
Click Destination Data Prefix to add a destination geolocation list or new geolocations.
Repeat Step 9 through Step 12.
Click Save Firewall Policy to save the security firewall rule.
Click Save Policy Changes.

Update the geodatabase for periodic updates:
Device# geo database update bootflash:geo_ipv4_db

Device(config)# object-group geo GEO_1
Add a continent to a geo group object:
Device(config-geo-group)# continent EU

Update the Geolocation Database Using the CLI
To ensure that you are using up-to-date geographical location data, we recommend that you update the geolocation database.
To update the geolocation database using the CLI:
On the CLI, use Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) or TFTP to copy the geolocation database to your Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device:
Device# copy scp: bootflash:
or
Device# copy tftp: bootflash:
