About Port Security
All switches in the Cisco MDS 9000 Family provide port security features that reject intrusion attempts and report these intrusions to the administrator.
Typically, any Fibre Channel device in a SAN can attach to any SAN switch port and access SAN services based on zone membership. Port security features prevent unauthorized access to a switch port in the Cisco MDS 9000 Family in the following ways:
•Login requests from unauthorized Fibre Channel devices (Nx ports) and switches (xE ports) are rejected.
•All intrusion attempts are reported to the SAN administrator through system messages.
•Configuration distribution uses the CFS infrastructure, and is limited to those switches that are CFS capable. Distribution is disabled by default.
•Configuring the port security policy requires the ENTERPRISE_PKG license (see the Cisco MDS 9000 Family NX-OS Licensing Guide).
This section includes the following topics:
•Port Security Enforcement
•About Auto-Learning
•Port Security Activation
Port Security Enforcement
To enforce port security, configure the devices and switch port interfaces through which each device or switch is connected, and activate the configuration.
•Use the port world wide name (pWWN) or the node world wide name (nWWN) to specify the Nx port connection for each device.
•Use the switch world wide name (sWWN) to specify the xE port connection for each switch.
Each Nx and xE port can be configured to restrict a single port or a range of ports.
Enforcement of port security policies are done on every activation and when the port tries to come up.
The port security feature uses two databases to accept and implement configuration changes.
•Configuration database—All configuration changes are stored in the configuration database.
•Active database—The database currently enforced by the fabric. The port security feature requires all devices connecting to a switch to be part of the port security active database. The software uses this active database to enforce authorization.
About Auto-Learning
You can instruct the switch to automatically learn (auto-learn) the port security configurations over a specified period. This feature allows any switch in the Cisco MDS 9000 Family to automatically learn about devices and switches that connect to it. Use this feature when you activate the port security feature for the first time as it saves tedious manual configuration for each port. You must configure auto-learning on a per-VSAN basis. If enabled, devices and switches that are allowed to connect to the switch are automatically learned, even if you have not configured any port access.
When auto-learning is enabled, learning happens for the devices or interfaces that were already logged into the switch and also for the new devices will login in future. Learned entries on a port are cleaned up after you shut down that port if auto-learning is still enabled.
Learning does not override the existing configured port security policies. So, for example, if an interface is configured to allow a specific pWWN, then auto-learning will not add a new entry to allow any other pWWN on that interface. All other pWWNs will be blocked even in auto-learning mode.
No entries are learned for a port in the shutdown state.
When you activate the port security feature, auto-learning is also automatically enabled.
Note If you activate port security feature, auto-learning gets enabled by default. You cannot re-activate port security until auto-learning is disabled or deactivate and activate again.
Port Security Activation
By default, the port security feature is not activated in any switch in the Cisco MDS 9000 Family.
By activating the port security feature, the following apply:
•Auto-learning is also automatically enabled, which means:
–From this point, auto-learning happens for the devices or interfaces that were already logged into the switch and also for the new devices will login in future.
–You cannot activate the database until you disable auto-learning.
•All the devices that are already logged in are learned and are added to the active database.
•All entries in the configured database are copied to the active database.
After the database is activated, subsequent device login is subject to the activated port bound WWN pairs, excluding the auto-learned entries. You must disable auto-learning before the auto-learned entries become activated.
When you activate the port security feature, auto-learning is also automatically enabled. You can choose to activate the port security feature and disable auto-learning.
Tip If a port is shut down because of a denied login attempt, and you subsequently configure the database to allow that login, the port does not come up automatically. You must explicitly issue a no shutdown CLI command to bring that port back online.
Port Security Configuration
The steps to configure port security depend on which features you are using. Auto-learning works differently if you are using CFS distribution.
This section includes the following topics:
•Configuring Port Security with Auto-Learning and CFS Distribution
•Configuring Port Security with Auto-Learning without CFS
•Configuring Port Security with Manual Database Configuration
Configuring Port Security with Auto-Learning and CFS Distribution
To configure port security, using auto-learning and CFS distribution, follow these steps:
Step 1 Enable port security. See the "Enabling Port Security" section.
Step 2 Enable CFS distribution. See the "Enabling Distribution" section.
Step 3 Activate port security on each VSAN. This turns on auto-learning by default. See the "Activating Port Security" section.
Step 4 Issue a CFS commit to copy this configuration to all switches in the fabric. See the "Committing the Changes" section. At this point, all switches are activated, and auto-learning.
Step 5 Wait until all switches and all hosts are automatically learned.
Step 6 Disable auto-learn on each VSAN. See the"Disabling Auto-learning" section.
Step 7 Issue a CFS commit to copy this configuration to all switches in the fabric. See the "Committing the Changes" section. At this point, the auto-learned entries from every switch are combined into a static active database that is distributed to all switches.
Step 8 Copy the active database to the configure database on each VSAN. See the "Copying the Port Security Database" section.
Step 9 Issue a CFS commit to copy this configuration to all switches in the fabric. See the "Committing the Changes" section. This ensures that the configure database is the same on all switches in the fabric.
Step 10 Copy the running configuration to the startup configuration, using the fabric option. This saves the port security configure database to the startup configuration on all switches in the fabric.
Configuring Port Security with Auto-Learning without CFS
To configure port security using auto-learning without CFS, follow these steps:
Step 1 Enable port security. See the "Enabling Port Security" section.
Step 2 Activate port security on each VSAN. This turns on auto-learning by default. See the "Activating Port Security" section.
Step 3 Wait until all switches and all hosts are automatically learned.
Step 4 Disable auto-learn on each VSAN. See the "Disabling Auto-learning" section.
Step 5 Copy the active database to the configure database on each VSAN. See the "Copying the Port Security Database" section.
Step 6 Copy the running configuration to the startup configuration This saves the port security configure database to the startup configuration.
Step 7 Repeat Step 1 through Step 6 for all switches in the fabric.
Configuring Port Security with Manual Database Configuration
To configure port security and manually configure the port security database, follow these steps:
Step 1 Enable port security. See the "Enabling Port Security" section.
Step 2 Manually configure all port security entries into the configure database on each VSAN. See the "Port Security Manual Configuration" section.
Step 3 Activate port security on each VSAN. This turns on auto-learning by default. See the "Activating Port Security" section.
Step 4 Disable auto-learn on each VSAN. See the "Disabling Auto-learning" section.
Step 5 Copy the running configuration to the startup configuration This saves the port security configure database to the startup configuration.
Step 6 Repeat Step 1 through Step 5 for all switches in the fabric.
Configuring Port Security Using the Configuration Wizard
The Port Security Configuration wizard provides step-by-step procedures for setting up the Port Security Policy for a selected VSAN. The Port Security Configuration wizard also supports the central management through CFS, making it possible to complete the entire configuration at one place.
The wizard automatically conducts few essential operations. For example, if you want central management, the wizard conducts operations to check CFS capability, enable CFS, and issue CFS commit at the proper stages.
To manage security at a particular port, you do not need to run through the wizard to configure the port security policy from the VSAN wide, but you can directly edit accesses on the port itself. This operation can be done through the Port Binding dialog box. If the port's belonging switch has not enabled port security yet, the dialog box enables security first. If the port security is enabled, the dialog box will edit the policy database based on user operations.
Prerequisites
The prerequisites for configuring port security are as follows:
•Port security is enabled on the switch.
•Port security policy should be defined either manually by editing bound devices or switches or ports or by using autolearning.
•Port Security policy is activated.
•Activated and configured databases are synchronized through copy.
•Activated database is copied to be the startup configuration.
•CFS should be enabled on all switches in the VSAN. A CFS master switch is selected to do all configurations. All changes will be distributed to the VSAN through the CFS commit command.
To configure port security, follow these steps:
Step 1 Click the Port Security button on the toolbar.
Before launching the Port Security Setup Wizard, Fabric Manager checks the CFS capability of the switches in the VSAN.
If VSAN context is not available, the wizard prompts to select VSAN as shown in Figure 9-1.

Port Security Manual Configuration
To configure port security on any switch in the Cisco MDS 9000 Family, follow these steps:
Step 1 Identify the WWN of the ports that need to be secured.
Step 2 Secure the fWWN to an authorized nWWN or pWWN.
Step 3 Activate the port security database.
Step 4 Verify your configuration.
This section includes the following topics:
•About WWN Identification
•Adding Authorized Port Pairs
•Deleting Port Security Setting
About WWN Identification
If you decide to manually configure port security, be sure to adhere to the following guidelines:
•Identify switch ports by the interface or by the fWWN.
•Identify devices by the pWWN or by the nWWN.
•If an Nx port is allowed to log in to SAN switch port Fx, then that Nx port can only log in through the specified Fx port.
•If an Nx port's nWWN is bound to an Fx port WWN, then all pWWNs in the Nx port are implicitly paired with the Fx port.
•TE port checking is done on each VSAN in the allowed VSAN list of the trunk port.
•All PortChannel xE ports must be configured with the same set of WWNs in the same PortChannel.
•E port security is implemented in the port VSAN of the E port. In this case the sWWN is used to secure authorization checks.
•Once activated, the config database can be modified without any effect on the active database.
•By saving the running configuration, you save the configuration database and activated entries in the active database. Learned entries in the active database are not saved.
Adding Authorized Port Pairs
After identifying the WWN pairs that need to be bound, add those pairs to the port security database.
Tip Remote switch binding can be specified at the local switch. To specify the remote interfaces, you can use either the fWWN or sWWN-interface combination.
To add authorized port pairs for port security using Fabric Manager, follow these steps:
Step 1 Expand a VSAN and select Port Security in the Logical Domains pane.
Step 2 Click the Config Database tab.
Step 3 Click Create Row to add an authorized port pair.
You see the Create Port Security dialog box shown in Figure 9-9.
Figure 9-9 Create Port Security Dialog Box
Step 4 Double-click the device from the available list for which you want to create the port security setting.
Step 5 Double-click the port from the available list to which you want to bind the device.
Step 6 Click Create to create the port security setting.
Step 7 Click the Apply Changes icon to save these changes.
Deleting Port Security Setting
To delete a port security setting from the configured database on a switch, follow these steps:
Step 1 Expand a VSAN and select Port Security in the Logical Domains pane.
Step 2 Click the Config Database tab.
You see the configured port security settings for that VSAN.
Step 3 Click the row you want to delete.
Step 4 Click Delete Row.
You see the confirmation dialog box.
Step 5 Click Yes to delete the row, or click No to close the confirmation dialog box without deleting the row.
Step 6 Click the Apply Changes icon to save these changes.
Port Security Configuration Distribution
The port security feature uses the Cisco Fabric Services (CFS) infrastructure to enable efficient database management, provide a single point of configuration for the entire fabric in the VSAN, and enforce the port security policies throughout the fabric.
This section includes the following topics:
•Enabling Distribution
•Locking the Fabric
•Committing the Changes
•Activation and Auto-learning Configuration Distribution
Enabling Distribution
All the configurations performed in distributed mode are stored in a pending (temporary) database. If you modify the configuration, you need to commit or discard the pending database changes to the configurations. The fabric remains locked during this period. Changes to the pending database are not reflected in the configurations until you commit the changes.
Note Port activation or deactivation and auto-learning enable or disable do not take effect until after a CFS commit if CFS distribution is enabled. Always follow any one of these operations with a CFS commit to ensure proper configuration. See the "Activation and Auto-learning Configuration Distribution" section.
Tip In this case, we recommend that you perform a commit at the end of each operation: after you activate port security and after you enable auto learning.
To enable distribution using Fabric Manager, follow these steps:
Step 1 Expand a VSAN and select Port Security in the Logical Domains pane.
You see the port security configuration for that VSAN in the Information pane (see Figure 9-8).
Step 2 Click the Control tab.
You see the switches for that VSAN.
Step 3 In the Command column, select enable or disable from the drop-down menu.
Step 4 Click the Apply Changes icon to save the changes.
Locking the Fabric
The first action that modifies the existing configuration creates the pending database and locks the feature in the VSAN. Once you lock the fabric, the following situations apply:
•No other user can make any configuration changes to this feature.
•A copy of the configuration database becomes the pending database.
Committing the Changes
If you commit the changes made to the configurations, the configurations in the pending database are distributed to other switches. On a successful commit, the configuration change is applied throughout the fabric and the lock is released.
Activation and Auto-learning Configuration Distribution
Activation and auto-learning configurations in distributed mode are remembered as actions to be performed when you commit the changes in the pending database.
Learned entries are temporary and do not have any role in determining if a login is authorized or not. As such, learned entries do not participate in distribution. When you disable learning and commit the changes in the pending database, the learned entries become static entries in the active database and are distributed to all switches in the fabric. After the commit, the active database on all switches are identical and learning can be disabled.
If the pending database contains more than one activation and auto-learning configuration when you commit the changes, then the activation and auto-learning changes are consolidated and the behavior may change (see Table 9-3).
Table 9-3 Scenarios for Activation and Auto- learning Configurations in Distributed Mode 
Scenario
Actions
Distribution = OFF
Distribution = ON
A and B exist in the configuration database, activation is not done and devices C,D are logged in.
1. You activate the port security database and enable auto-learning.
configuration database = {A,B}
active database = {A,B, C1 , D*}
configuration database = {A,B}
active database = {null}
pending database = {A,B + activation to be enabled}
2. A new entry E is added to the configuration database.
configuration database = {A,B, E}
active database = {A,B, C*, D*}
configuration database = {A,B}
active database = {null}
pending database = {A,B, E + activation to be enabled}
3. You issue a commit.
Not applicable
configuration database = {A,B, E}
active database = {A,B, E, C*, D*}
pending database = empty
A and B exist in the configuration database, activation is not done and devices C,D are logged in.
1. You activate the port security database and enable auto-learning.
configuration database = {A,B}
active database = {A,B, C*, D*}
configuration database = {A,B}
active database = {null}
pending database = {A,B + activation to be enabled}
2. You disable learning.
configuration database = {A,B}
active database = {A,B, C, D}
configuration database = {A,B}
active database = {null}
pending database = {A,B + activation to be enabled +
learning to be disabled}
3. You issue a commit.
Not applicable
configuration database = {A,B}
active database = {A,B} and devices C and D are logged out. This is equal to an activation with auto-learning disabled.
pending database = empty
1 The * (asterisk) indicates learned entries.

Tip In this case, we recommend that you perform a commit at the end of each operation: after you activate port security and after you enable auto-learning.
Database Merge Guidelines
A database merge refers to a union of the configuration database and static (unlearned) entries in the active database.
When merging the database between two fabrics, follow these guidelines:
•Verify that the activation status and the auto-learning status is the same in both fabrics.
•Verify that the combined number of configurations for each VSAN in both databases does not exceed 2 K.
Caution If you do not follow these two conditions, the merge will fail. The next distribution will forcefully synchronize the databases and the activation states in the fabric.
Database Interaction
Table 9-4 lists the differences and interaction between the active and configuration databases.

Saving the configuration only saves the activated entries. Learned entries are not saved.
Saving the configuration saves all the entries in the configuration database.
Once activated, all devices that have already logged into the VSAN are also learned and added to the active database.
Once activated, the configuration database can be modified without any effect on the active database.
You can overwrite the active database with the configured database by activating the port security database. Forcing an activation may violate the entries already configured in the active database.

Database Scenarios
Figure 9-10 depicts various scenarios to depict the active database and the configuration database status based on port security configurations.
Figure 9-10 Port Security Database Scenarios
Copying the Port Security Database
Tip We recommend that you copy the active database to the config database after disabling auto-learning. This action will ensure that the configuration database is in sync with the active database. If distribution is enabled, this command creates a temporary copy (and consequently a fabric lock) of the configuration database. If you lock the fabric, you need to commit the changes to the configuration databases in all the switches.
To copy the active database to the configuration database, using Fabric Manager, follow these steps:
Step 1 Expand a Fabric, expand a VSAN and then select Port Security in the Logical Domains pane.
Step 2 Click the Actions tab. You see all the configuration databases.
Step 3 Select the appropriate configuration database and check the Copy Active to Config check box.
Step 4 Click the Apply Changes icon to save your changes.
To view the differences between the active database and the configuration database using Fabric Manager, follow these steps:
Step 1 Expand a Fabric, expand a VSAN and then select Port Security in the Logical Domains pane.
You see the Port Security information in the Information pane.
Step 2 Click the Database Differences tab. You see all the configuration databases.
Step 3 Select the appropriate configuration database. Select the Active or Config option to compare the differences between the selected database and the active or configuration database.
Step 4 Click the Apply Changes icon to save your changes.
Deleting the Port Security Database
Tip If the distribution is enabled, the deletion creates a copy of the database. An explicit deletion is required to actually delete the database.
To delete a port security database using Fabric Manager, follow these steps:
Step 1 Expand a Fabric, expand a VSAN and then select Port Security in the Logical Domains pane.
You see the Port Security information in the Information pane.
Step 2 Click the Config Database tab. You see all the configuration databases.
Step 3 Select the appropriate configuration database and click the Delete Row button.
Step 4 Click Yes if you want to delete the configuration database.
Cleaning the Port Security Database
To clear all existing statistics from the port security database for a specified VSAN using Fabric Manager, follow these steps:
Step 1 Expand a Fabric, expand a VSAN and then select Port Security in the Logical Domains pane.
You see the Port Security information in the Information pane (see Figure 9-8).
Step 2 Click the Statistics tab.
You see all the configuration databases.
Step 3 Select the appropriate configuration database and check the Clear option.
Step 4 Click the Apply Changes icon to save your changes.
To clear any learned entries in the active database for a specified interface within a VSAN using Fabric Manager, follow these steps:
Step 1 Expand a Fabric, expand a VSAN and then select Port Security in the Logical Domains pane.
You see the Port Security information in the Information pane.
Step 2 Select the Actions tab. You see all the configuration databases.
Step 3 Select the appropriate configuration database and check the AutoLearn option.
Step 4 Click the Apply Changes icon to save your changes.
Note You can clear the Statistics and the AutoLearn option only for switches that are local and do not acquire locks. Also, learned entries are only local to the switch and do not participate in distribution.
Default Settings
Table 9-5 lists the default settings for all port security features in any switch.
