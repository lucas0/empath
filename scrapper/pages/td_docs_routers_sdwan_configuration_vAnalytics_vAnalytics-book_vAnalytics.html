Overview
Cisco vAnalytics is a cloud-based analytics service for Cisco SD-WAN offering comprehensive insights into application and network performance. The analytics service is available with Cisco DNA Advantage and Cisco DNA Premier software subscriptions. Cisco vAnalytics collects and stores metadata about traffic flows in its cloud storage and produces analytics based on this collected data.
Some of the key benefits of Cisco vAnalytics service are:
Network Visibility: Gain visibility into key network performance metrics, such as loss, latency, jitter, and availability.
Application Experience: Assess Quality of Experience (QoE) for applications deployed in data centres and on cloud.
Operational Insights: Establish historical benchmarks, identify trends, and correlate application experience with the underlying network behavior.
Path Recommendations: Gain insights into the quality of the current network paths your applications are taking, and the quality of the alternate recommended paths for better application experience.
Faster Resolution: Lower the mean time to identification (MTTI) of issues with faster root cause isolation.
Application Flows: Gain insights into application traffic flows over various network paths.
Top Talkers: Identify top consumers of network bandwidth.
Reporting: Generate analysis reports for offline review by CIO/CTO/COO and network teams.
Prerequisites
You must configure the following options in Cisco vManage to use Cisco vAnalytics:
An overlay must be onboarded to Cisco vAnalytics. If an overlay is not onboarded, open a case with Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC).
Configure app-visibility. See Configure Global Application Visibility.
Configure the network time protocol (NTP) servers. NTP must be configured to synchronize time on all the controllers and devices in the Cisco SD-WAN fabric. See Configure NTP using Cisco vManage.
Restrictions
Statistics for applications flowing through the Direct Internet Access (DIA) exit is displayed only if Cloud onRamp for SaaS is enabled for those applications.
To view statistics for custom applications flowing through the DIA exit, enable Cloud onRamp for SaaS for the custom application. The name of the application list in Cloud onRamp for SaaS must be the same as the custom application name.
Cisco vAnalytics accounts for only the egress traffic. Therefore, you may notice variations between application usage statistics reported by Cisco vManage and the statistics reported by Cisco vAnalytics.
Cisco vAnalytics provides insights only on sites and circuits that were actively used by application traffic on the overlay. Insights are not available for unused sites and circuits.
Cisco vAnalytics provides insights only for traffic passing through the Cisco SD-WAN tunnels or taking a DIA path (with CoR SaaS Enabled). Non SD-WAN tunnels (SIG Tunnels) are not supported in Cisco vAnalytics.
The Path Recommendations feature has limited availability and is available for those who have signed up for private preview in Americas. Contact your account representative for more details.
Onboarding Cisco vAnalytics
To onboard Cisco vAnalytics for your overlay for the first time, open a case with Cisco Support here: https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/case. In a multi-tenant deployment, each tenant must be separately onboarded to Cisco vAnalytics. After your overlay is onboarded to Cisco vAnalytics, enable data collection in your vManage configuration as described in the respective section below. Refer to Request New Onboarding of an Overlay for Cisco vAnalytics section for more details.

Authentication and Authorization
Cisco vAnalytics users can be authenticated using one of the following methods or IDs:
Cisco CCO ID: The ID that they use to log in to Cisco Software Central
My Organization ID: The ID defined in and authenticated by their organization's identity provider (IdP)

Note
The organization IdP must support SAML 2.0 or OIDC protocol to interoperate with Cisco vAnalytics
Existing Okta ID: The Cisco-assigned Okta ID

Note
Support for login using Cisco-assigned Okta ID has been deprecated, and in some cases it may still be in use. Cisco recommends such users to transition to using either your CCO ID or your organization's Id at the earliest.
Authorization with Cisco CCO ID
You can manage user access and operational privileges through Cisco Software Central. Each overlay is associated with a Virtual Account. To allow a user to access Cisco vAnalytics for a particular overlay, add the user to the Virtual Account in one of the following capacities:
Virtual Account Administrator: The user can access all Cisco vAnalytics screens for the overlay. In addition, the user can configure the IdP to be used for user authentication for the overlay.
Virtual Account User: The user can access all Cisco vAnalytics screens for the overlay.
Alternatively, you can add a user to a Smart Account. Doing so allows the user to access Cisco vAnalytics for all Virtual Accounts belonging to the Smart Account. This option of adding a user at the Smart Account level is especially useful for managed service providers (MSPs) and enterprises managing multiple overlays. You can add a user to a Smart Account in one of the following capacities:
Smart Account Administrator: The user can access all Cisco vAnalytics screens for all the overlays. In addition, the user can view the reports tab and generate reports for anlysis. This user can also configure the IdP to be used for all the overlays or configure the use of an organization IdP for a particular overlay.
Smart Account User: The user can access all the Cisco vAnalytics screens for the overlay.

Note
A Smart Account Approver has the same privileges as a Smart Account User.
Authorization with Organization ID
When authenticated by their organization's IdP, users are granted access to overlays and operations based on the default role assigned to them while defining organization IdP on Cisco vAnalytics. Alternatively, user role can be updated by using the authzCiscovAnalytics attribute on the organization IdP.
Use the following syntax to specify the default role or a value for the authzCiscovAnalytics attribute:
<syntax-version>;<overlay-1>:<role1>[,<role2>][;<overlay-2>:<role1>[,<role2>]]...
Currently, only one version of the syntax is supported and you must specify the syntax version as v1.
You can specify an overlay name and the user privileges for the overlay in the format: <overlay-1>:<role1>[,<role2>].
To assign the same privileges to the user for all the overlays, specify the overlay name as *. Further, if a set of overlays share a part of their name, you can specify the set of the overlays using a combination of the shared part of the name and the wildcard character *.
If you're configuring the IdP for a single overlay, specify the overlay name as *.
The Cisco Smart Account or Virtual Account administrator must first login to Cisco vAnalytics service using the Cisco CCO ID. After login, the administrator can view a list of Smart Accounts or Virtual Accounts that they have access to. The administrator will then be able to define organization IDP against Cisco vAnalytics for subsequent access through organization ID by users.
If the administrator belongs to more than one Virtual Account, Smart Account, or both, the administrator sees the Smart Accounts screen. The Smart Accounts screen lists the Smart Accounts and Virtual Accounts to which the administrator is subscribed. Each Virtual Account represents an overlay network.
The administrator sees the Overview Dashboard page if the administrator belongs to only one Virtual Account and Smart Account, and therefore, has access to only one overlay. From the Overview Dashboard, you can access the Smart Accounts screen by clicking View all overlays.
For an overlay, if Cisco vAnalytics has been onboarded, the entry under vAnalytics Status reads Active; if Cisco vAnalytics is not onboarded, the entry reads New. If Cisco vAnalytics is available for an overlay, you can launch the Dashboard for overlay by clicking on the overlay or Virtual Account name.

Note
If the vAnalytics Status for an overlay reads New, but you are aware that Cisco vAnalytics has been onboarded, verify whether you have logged in using the correct Cisco vAnalytics URL. See Access Cisco vAnalytics to use one of the URLs based on the location of your Cisco vAnalytics.
To pause data processing for an overlay, click … adjacent to the overlay name and choose Deactivate. When data processing is paused, the vAnalytics Status reads InActive (Paused). To resume data processing, choose Activate.
The entry under IDP Server indicates whether your organization's IdP is configured to be used with the overlay or not (Not Defined).
To configure an IdP for an overlay for which Cisco vAnalytics has been activated, click ... under Actions, and click Define IDP. For more information on defining the IdP, see Define Organization IdP for Overlays.
Define Organization IdP for Overlays
As an administrator for a Smart Account, you can configure your organization's IdP to be used for authenticating Cisco vAnalytics users for all or some of the overlays. As an administrator for a Virtual Account or an overlay, you can configure your organization's IdP to be used for authenticating Cisco vAnalytics users for the overlay.
