Introduction
This document describes the configuration of ASR 9000 series Aggregation Services Router (ASR) in order to authenticate and authorize via TACACS+ with Cisco Identity Services Engine 2.4 server.
Background Information
It examples the implementation of the administrative model of task-based authorization that is used in order to control user access in the Cisco IOS® XR software system. The major tasks required to implement task-based authorization involve how to configure user groups and task groups. User groups and task groups are configured through the Cisco IOS® XR software command set used for Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) services. Authentication commands are used to verify the identity of a user or principal. Authorization commands are used to verify that an authenticated user (or principal) is granted permission in order to perform a specific task. Accounting commands are used for logging of sessions and to create an audit trail by recording certain user or system generated actions.

Predefined Components on the IOS® XR
There are predefined user groups and task groups in IOS® XR. The administrator can either use these predefined groups or define custom groups as per requirement.
Predefined User Groups
These user groups are predefined on IOS® XR:
User Group Privileges
cisco-support Debug and troubleshoot features (usually, used by Cisco Technical Support personnel).
netadmin Configure network protocols such as Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) (usually used by network administrators).
operator Perform day-to-day monitoring activities, and have limited configuration rights.
root-lr Display and execute all commands within a single RP.
root-system Display and execute all commands for all RPs in the system.
sysadmin Perform system administration tasks for the router, such as maintaining where the core dumps are stored or setting up the Network Time Protocol (NTP) clock.
serviceadmin Perform service administration tasks, such as Session Border Controller (SBC).
Each predefined user group has certain task groups mapped to them and cannot be modified. Use these commands in order to check the predefined user groups: 
RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9k#sh aaa usergroup ?

  |              Output Modifiers
  root-lr        Name of the usergroup
  netadmin       Name of the usergroup
  operator       Name of the usergroup
  sysadmin       Name of the usergroup
  retrieval      Name of the usergroup
  maintenance    Name of the usergroup
  root-system    Name of the usergroup
  provisioning   Name of the usergroup
  read-only-tg   Name of the usergroup
  serviceadmin   Name of the usergroup
  cisco-support  Name of the usergroup
  WORD           Name of the usergroup
  <cr>
Pre-Defined Task Groups
These predefined task groups are available for administrators to use, typically for initial configuration:

cisco-support: Cisco support personnel tasks
netadmin: Network administrator tasks
operator: Operator day-to-day tasks (for demonstration purposes)
root-lr: Secure domain router administrator tasks
root-system: System-wide administrator tasks
sysadmin: System administrator tasks
serviceadmin: Service administration tasks
Use these commands in order to check the predefined task groups:
RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR9k#show aaa taskgroup ? 

 |              Output Modifiers 
 root-lr        Name of the taskgroup 
 netadmin       Name of the taskgroup 
 operator       Name of the taskgroup 
 sysadmin       Name of the taskgroup 
 root-system    Name of the taskgroup 
 serviceadmin   Name of the taskgroup  
 cisco-support  Name of the taskgroup 
 WORD           Name of the taskgroup 
 <cr>  
Use this command in order to check the supported tasks:
RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR9k#show aaa task supported
Here is the list of supported tasks:

Each of these mentioned tasks can be given with any of these or all the four permissions:
Read
Specifies a designation that permits only a read operation.
Write
Specifies a designation that permits a change operation and implicitly allows a read operation.
Execute
Specifies a designation that permits an access operation; for example, ping and Telnet.
Debug
Specifies a designation that permits a debug operation.
User-Defined Task Groups
Administrators can configure custom task groups to meet particular needs. Here is a configuration example:
RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR9k(config)#taskgroup TAC-Defined-TASK
RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR9k(config-tg)#task ?
  debug    Specify a debug-type task ID
  execute  Specify a execute-type task ID
  read     Specify a read-type task ID
  write    Specify a read-write-type task ID
 
RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR9k(config-tg)#task read aaa
RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR9k(config-tg)#task write aaa
RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR9k(config-tg)#task execute aaa
RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR9k(config-tg)#task debug aaa
RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR9k(config-tg)#task read acl
RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR9k(config-tg)#task write acl
RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR9k(config-tg)#task execute acl
RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR9k(config-tg)#commit
 
RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR9k#show aaa taskgroup TAC-Defined-TASK
Task group 'TAC-Defined-TASK'
 
Task IDs included directly by this group:
Task:                  aaa  : READ    WRITE    EXECUTE    DEBUG
Task:                  acl  : READ    WRITE    EXECUTE         
 
Task group 'TAC-Defined-TASK' has the following combined set
  of task IDs (including all inherited groups):
Task:                  aaa  : READ    WRITE    EXECUTE    DEBUG
Task:                  acl  : READ    WRITE    EXECUTE      
Describe command can be used to find what task group and permission is needed for a certain command.
Example 1.
 
RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR9k#describe show aaa usergroup
Package:
.....
User needs ALL of the following taskids: 
 
aaa (READ)
RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR9k#
 
In order to allow a user to run the commandshow aaa usergroup, task group: task read aaa should be assigned to the usergroup.
Example 2.
   RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR9k(config)#describe aaa authentication login default group tacacs+
Package:
.....
User needs ALL of the following taskids:
 
aaa (READ WRITE)
RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR9k(config)#
 
In order to allow a user to run the commandaaa authentication login default group tacacs+from the configuration mode, task group: task read write aaa should be assigned to the usergroup.
Administrators can define the user group that can inherit several task groups. Here is the configuration example:
RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR9k#show aaa usergroup TAC-Defined
Tue Feb 16 00:50:56.799 UTC
User group 'TAC-Defined'
  Inherits from task group 'operator'
 
User group 'TAC-Defined' has the following combined set
  of task IDs (including all inherited groups):
Task:       basic-services  : READ    WRITE    EXECUTE    DEBUG
Task:                  cdp  : READ                             
Task:                 diag  : READ                             
Task:           ext-access  : READ             EXECUTE

AAA Configuration on the Router
Configure the TACACS server on the ASR router with the IP address and the shared secret to be used.
 
RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR9k(config)#tacacs-server host 10.106.73.233 port 49
RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR9k(config-tacacs-host)#key 0 cisco
RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR9k(config-tacacs-host)#commit
 
!
tacacs-server host 10.127.196.160 port 49
key 7 14141B180F0B
!
Configure authentication and authorization in order to use TACACS server configured. 
#aaa authentication login default group tacacs+ local
#aaa authorization exec default group tacacs+ local
Configure command authorization to use TACACS server configured (optional):
Note: Ensure that the authentication and authorization work as expected, and ensure that the command sets are also configured properly before you enable command authorization. If not configured properly, users might not be able to enter any commands on the device.
#aaa authorization commands default group tacacs+
Configure command accounting in order to use TACACS server configured (optional). 
#aaa accounting commands default start-stop group tacacs+
#aaa accounting update newinfo
ISE Server Configuration
Step 1. In order to define the router IP in the AAA clients list on ISE server, navigate to Administration > Network Resources > Network Devices as shown in the image. Shared secret should be the same as the one configured on the ASR Router as shown in the image.
Network Device Configuration
Network Device Configuration
Step 2. Define the user groups as per your requirement, in the example, as shown in this image, you use four groups. You can define the groups under Administration > Identity Management > Groups > User Identity Groups. The groups created in this example are:
ASR-Operator
ASR-Operator-AAA
ASR-RootSystem
ASR-Sysadmin
Identity GroupsStep 3. As shown in the image, create the users and map them to the respective user group that was created before.
Identities/Users
Note: In this example, the ISE internal users are used for authentication and authorization. Authentications and authorizations with External Identity Source are out of the scope of this document. 
Step 4. Define the Shell Profile to be pushed for the respective users. In order to do so, navigate to Work Centers > Device Administration > Policy Elements > Results > TACACS Profiles. One can configure a new shell profile as shown in the images as well for previous versions of ISE. The shell profiles defined in this example are:
1. ASR_Operator
2. ASR_RootSystem
3. ASR_Sysadmin
4. Operator_with_AAA
Shell Profiles for TACACS
One can click on the Add button to enter the fields Type, Name and Value as shown in the images under the Custom Attributes section.
For Operator role:
ASR Operator shell profileFor root-system role:
ASR Root System shell profileFor sysadmin role:
ASR Sysadmin shell profileFor operator and AAA role:
Operator with AAA shell profileStep 5. Configure the Identity Source Sequence to use the Internal Users at Administration > Identity Management > Identity Source Sequences. One can either add a new Identity Source Sequence or edit the available ones.
Step 6. Configure the authentication policy at Work Centers > Device Administration > Device Admin Policy Sets > [Choose Policy Set] in order to make use of the Identity Store Sequence that contains the internal users. Configure the authorization based on the requirement with the use of the previously created user identity groups and map the respective Shell Profiles, as shown in the image.
Authentication Policy
Authorization policies can be configured in many ways based on the requirement. The rules shown here in the image are based on the device location, type and the specific internal user identity group. The Shell Profiles selected will be pushed at the time of the authorization along with the Command Sets.
