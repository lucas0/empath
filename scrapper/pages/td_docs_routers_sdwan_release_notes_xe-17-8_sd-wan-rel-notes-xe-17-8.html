Feature Description
Cisco SD-WAN Getting Started Guide
Support for Postpaid MSLA License Billing Models
For postpaid Managed Services License Agreement Program (MSLA) licenses, Cisco SD-WAN supports a distinction of two billing models for licenses—committed (MSLA-C) and uncommitted (MSLA-U) licenses. Beginning with Cisco vManage Release 20.8.1, the procedure for assigning a postpaid license enables you to choose one of these two MSLA license types.
Cisco SD-WAN Systems and Interfaces
Configuration Groups and Feature Profiles
This feature provides a simple, reusable, and structured approach for configuration in Cisco SD-WAN. You can create a configuration group, that is, a logical grouping of devices that share a common purpose within your WAN. You can also create profiles based on features that are required, recommended, or uniquely used, and then combine the profiles to complete a device configuration.
The configuration group workflows in Cisco vManage provide a guided method to create configuration groups and feature profiles.
User-Defined Device Tagging
This feature helps you add tags to devices. You can use the tags for grouping, describing, finding, or managing devices.
Cisco Unified Communications FXS and FXO Caller ID Support
This feature lets you configure Foreign Exchange Station (FXS) and Foreign Exchange Office (FXO) caller ID features by using Cisco vManage CLI add-on feature templates.
Ability to Configure APNs under Running Configurations for Single and Dual SIMs
This feature allows you to create a data profile for a cellular device by configuring one or two SIMs in the device.
Added Support for LTE Advanced NIM Modules
Added support for Long-Term Evolution (LTE) Advanced Network Interface Modules (NIMs) for Cisco ISR 4000 routers.
Cisco ThousandEyes Support for Cisco Catalyst 8500 Series Edge Platforms and Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers
You can deploy Cisco ThousandEyes Enterprise agent natively as a container application on Cisco Catalyst 8500 Series Edge Platforms and Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers. You can install and activate the Cisco ThousandEyes Enterprise agent through Cisco vManage.
Cisco SD-WAN Routing
RIPng (IPv6) Support on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Devices
This feature adds support for IPv6 addresses and prefixes on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. It also supports redistribution of connect, static, OMP, and OSPF routes into RIPng and vice versa.
Cisco SD-WAN Policies
Traffic Redirection to SIG Using Data Policy: Fallback to Routing
With this feature, you can configure internet-bound traffic to be routed through the SD-WAN overlay, as a fallback mechanism, when all the SIG tunnels are down.
Redirect DNS in a Service-Side VPN
This feature enables Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices to respond to Domain Name System (DNS) queries using a specific configuration and the associated proxy servers. This feature adds support for DNS proxy for servce-side VPN hosts and DNS redirect inside the service VPNs.
You can configure redirect DNS using Cisco vManage or a device CLI.
Cisco SD-WAN Security
SIG Integration Improvements
Source-Only Load Sharing: When you configure two or more active tunnels to a SIG, different traffic flows from the same source IP address, with different destination public IP addresses, may be mapped to use different tunnels. With this feature, you can configure all traffic flows from a particular source IP address, irrespective of the destination IP address, to be routed to the SIG through only one of the active tunnels.
IPSec Tunnel Creation Improvements in an Active-Active Setup: This feature ensures that when you provision an IPSec tunnel, the control and data traffic are sent through the same the physical interface toward the SIG endpoint. Pinning the control and data packets to the same physical interface removes a limitation that exists in previous releases.
In previous releases, in certain situations, the control and data packets may be routed to the SIG endpoint through different physical interfaces. When the packets are routed in this way, one of the following scenarios occurs:
If the source is a physical interface, tunnel creation fails because the source IP address of the negotiation packets differs from the source IP address of the keepalive control packet.
If the source is a loopback interface, the source IP address of the data packets differs from the source IP address of the IPSec SA negotiated through the control packets. This difference causes the SIG endpoint to drop the data packets.
Layer 7 Health Check for Manual Tunnels
You can create and attach trackers to manually created GRE or IPSec tunnels to a SIG endpoint. Trackers help failover traffic when a SIG tunnel is down.
Cisco SD-WAN Cloud OnRamp
Support for SVL Port Configuration on 100G Interfaces
With this feature, you can configure SVL ports on 100G Ethernet interfaces of Cisco Catalyst 9500-48Y4C switches, thus ensuring a high level of performance and throughput.
View Details of Microsoft Telemetry and View Application Server Information for Office 365 Traffic
This feature adds better visibility into how Cloud onRamp for SaaS determines the best path for Microsoft Office 365 traffic, if you have opted to use Microsoft telemetry.
One enhancement is a chart that shows how Microsoft rates the connection quality of different interfaces, specifically for different types (called service areas) of Office 365 traffic. This is helpful for troubleshooting Office 365 performance issues.
Another addition is the SD-AVC Cloud Connector page, which shows a list of Microsoft URL/IP endpoints and categories that Cisco SD-WAN receives from Microsoft Cloud.
User-Defined SaaS Application Lists
This feature expands the range of SaaS applications that Cloud onRamp for SaaS can monitor, and for which it can determine the best network path. The feature enables you to define lists of one or more SaaS applications, together with the relevant application server for those SaaS applications. Cloud onRamp for SaaS handles these lists in the same way that it handles the predefined set of SaaS applications that it can monitor.
When you enable a user-defined list, Cloud onRamp for SaaS probes for the best path to the application server and routes the application traffic for applications in the list to use the best path.
Periodic Audit, Enhancement to Azure Scaling and Audit, and ExpressRoute Connection
Cisco vManage provides an optional periodic audit with an interval of two hours. This automatic audit takes place in the background and generates a report of the discrepancies. If you enable the auto correct option, then Cisco vManage automatically resolves any recoverable issues found during the periodic audit.
Discrepancies generated after initiating an on-demand audit are individually fixable.
ExpressRoute connections are the private networks that offer higher reliability, fewer latencies, and faster connections for data transfer.
Cisco SD-WAN Interconnect to Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure
You can create software-defined interconnects to Google Cloud VPCs, or Microsoft Azure VNets or Virtual WANs to link your branch location to the cloud resources through the Equinix fabric. You can also create, update and delete device links from Interconnect Gateway in the Equinix fabric.
Cisco SD-WAN Monitor and Maintain
Software Upgrade Workflow for Cisco SD-WAN edge devices.
This feature introduces a guided workflow through which you can upgrade the software image on your Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices and Cisco vEdge devices and monitor the status of the software upgrade.
With this workflow, you can choose to download, install, and activate the new software image in discrete steps or in a single step.
Bidirectional Support for Packet Tracing
This feature provides a detailed understanding of how data packets are processed by the edge devices in both the directions. The bidirectional debugging can help you to diagnose issues and troubleshoot them more efficiently.
Site Topology Visualization in Cisco vManage
You can now view the topology diagram of a site in Cisco vManage.
Cisco SD-WAN SNMP
Cisco SD-WAN MIBs
The following Cisco SD-WAN MIBs are introduced on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices:
CISCO-SDWAN-PROBE-MIB.my
CISCO-SDWAN-OMP-MIB.my (additional tables added)
CISCO-SDWAN-SECURITY-MIB.my (additional tables added)
Cisco SD-WAN NAT
Support for NAT DIA IPv4 over an IPv6 Tunnel
This feature provides support for an IPv4 client to access IPv4 servers when using an IPv6 network.
IPv4 traffic is routed to the internet over an IPv6 tunnel.
You can configure NAT DIA IPv4 over an IPv6 tunnel using a device CLI or a CLI add-on template.
Service-Side Conditional Static NAT Support
This feature allows you to translate the same source IP address to different IP addresses based on the destination IP addresses.
You can configure service-side conditional static NAT using a device CLI.
Service-Side Static Network NAT Support
This feature supports configuration of service-side static NAT for a subnet. Instead of configuring multiple static NAT pools, you can configure a single static NAT pool for an entire subnet.
You can configure service-side static network NAT using Cisco vManage or a device CLI template.
Service-Side NAT Object Tracker Support
This feature adds support for tracking LAN prefixes and LAN interfaces for service-side inside static NAT.
When the object tracker that is associated with a NAT route changes state (up or down), the NAT OMP route is added or removed from the routing table. You can view notifications in Cisco vManage for monitoring the NAT routes and interfaces that are added or removed.
You can configure the service-side NAT object tracker using Cisco vManage, a device CLI template, or a CLI add-on template.
Cisco Hierarchical SD-WAN Configuration Guide
Hierarchical SD-WAN: Secondary Regions
Secondary regions provide another facet to the Hierarchical SD-WAN architecture and enable direct tunnel connections between edge routers in different primary access regions. When you assign an edge router a secondary region, the router effectively operates in two regions simultaneously, and has different paths available through its primary and secondary regions.
Hierarchical SD-WAN: Transport Gateways
An edge router or border router that has connections to two networks that lack direct connectivity can function as a transport gateway. This is helpful for enabling connectivity between routers that are configured to be within the same access region, but which do not have direct connectivity.
Hierarchical SD-WAN: Router Affinity
Often a router has multiple options to choose for the next hop when routing a flow to its destination. When multiple devices can serve as the next hop for a flow, you can specify the order of preference among the devices by configuring router affinity groups. The result is that a router attempts to use a route to the next-hop device of highest preference first, and if that device is not available, it attempts to use a route to the next-hop device of the next lower preference. Affinity groups enable this functionality without requiring complex control policies.
Software and Hardware Behavior Changes in Cisco IOS XE Release 17.8.1a

Change in time-out behavior for template push to CCM.
In Cisco vManage Release 20.7.x and earlier releases, the Cisco Colo Manager (CCM) and CSP device configuration tasks time out 30 minutes after the tasks are created. In the case of long-running image installation operations, these configuration tasks may time out and fail, while the cluster activation state continues to be in a pending state.
From Cisco vManage Release 20.8.1, the CCM and CSP device configuration tasks time out 30 minutes after the last heartbeat status message that Cisco vManage received from the target devices. With this change, long-running image installation operations do not cause configuration tasks to fail after a predefined interval of time after task creation.
Change in CCM workflow.
In Cisco vManage Release 20.7.x and earlier releases, Cisco Colo Manager (CCM) bring up and activation progress is reported as part of the CLOUD ONRAMP CCM task. This task shows the seven steps in the CCM bring up and activation sequence and indicates whether the sequence was successfully completed or not. The Push Feature Template Configuration task shows the status of the RBAC settings configuration push.
From Cisco vManage Release 20.8.1, CLOUD ONRAMP CCM task is completed when Cisco vManage receives CCM Healthy from the target CSP device. The Push Feature Template Configuration task shows the seven steps in the CCM bring up and activation sequence and indicates whether the sequence was successfully completed or not, along with the status of the RBAC settings configuration push.
Important Notes, Known Behavior, and Workaround
Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices with the SFP-10G-SR module do not support online insertion and removal (OIR) of this module.
Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1 implements a hardened security posture to comply with FedRamp guidelines. As a result, your vAnalytics login credentials that are stored locally get erased on upgrading the software, and you cannot access the vAnalytics service directly through Cisco vManage. In this case, log in to vAnalytics using this URL: https://analytics.viptela.com. If you can’t find your vAnalytics login credentials, open a case with Cisco TAC support.
Starting from Cisco IOS XE Release 17.5.1a, the table keyword is added to all show sdwan commands for which the output needs to be displayed in a tabular format. Using | tab is restricted for all Cisco SD-WAN commands starting from Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Release 16.11.x.
