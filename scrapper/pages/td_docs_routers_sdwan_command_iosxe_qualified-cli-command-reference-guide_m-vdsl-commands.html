Command History
Release Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco SD-WAN Manager CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
The Cisco multimode VDSL2 and ADSL1/2/2+ provides 1-port (2-pair) multimode VDSL2 and ADSL2+ WAN connectivity.
Double-Ended Line Testing (DELT) is a wideband line testing technique used after a DSL modem has been installed on the subscriber premises. It relies on the equipment on both ends of the line to perform its testing, thus requiring a connected and available DELT-capable CPE.
DELT measures the characteristics of the line by transmitting special test signals from one end to the other, and evaluating the signal received based on knowledge of the signal transmitted from the source.
Use diagnosticsDELT command to enable DELT diagnostics mode for a VDSL controller.
Example
The following example shows how to enable DELT diagnostics mode on the VDSL controller 0/0/0.
Device(config)# controller VDSL 0/0/0
Device(config-controller)# diagnostics DELT

Command Default
None
Command Modes
VDSL controller configuration (config-controller).
Command History
Release Modification
Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1v
Command qualified for use in Cisco SD-WAN Manager CLI templates.
Usage Guidelines
VDSL2 and ADSL2/2+ routers provide highly reliable WAN connections for remote sites. These interfaces offer cost-effective virtualized WAN connections in both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint designs.
The Cisco multimode VDSL2 and ADSL1/2/2+ provides 1-port (2-pair) multimode VDSL2 and ADSL2+ WAN connectivity.
VDSL controllers have a firmware that can be upgraded separately from the IOS XE firmware. The VDSL controller firmware gets copied to a designated location on Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device. The Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device gets configured to load from the designated location and rebooted for the new firmware to take affect.
Use firmware phy filename command to configure the Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device to load the VDSL controller firmware from a designated location.
Example
The following example shows how to configure the Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device to load the VDSL controller firmware gs_39x3_gnu.pkg from bootflash.
Device(config)# controller VDSL 0/0/0
Device(config-controller)# firmware phy filename bootflash:gs_39x3_gnu.pkg
