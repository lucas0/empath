Superior Flexibility and Performance
The new Cisco UCS Virtual Interface Card 1227T improves flexibility, performance, and bandwidth for Cisco UCS rack-mount servers. The card offers a modular LAN on motherboard (mLOM) adapter. The mLOM slot can be used to install the card without consuming a Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) slot. This provides greater I/O expandability.

Features and Capabilities
Designed for Flexibility
A Cisco innovation, the 1227T card is a dual-port, 10GBASE-T (RJ-45), 10 Gigabit Ethernet, Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE)-capable, PCIe mLOM adapter. It is designed exclusively for the M4 generation of Cisco UCS C-Series Rack Servers and the C3160 dense-storage server.
A stateless and agile server infrastructure provides the capability to define, create, and use interfaces on demand. Thatâ€™s why the personality of the 1227T card is determined dynamically at boot time using the service profile associated with the server.
The service profile determines:
Number and type of PCIe interfaces, whether virtual network interface card (vNIC) or virtual host bus adapter (vHBA)
Identity (MAC address) and World Wide Name (WWN)
Failover policy
Bandwidth
Quality-of-service (QoS) policies
Cisco Data Center Virtual Machine Fabric Extender (VM-FEX)
The 1227T card implements a Cisco fabric extender that unifies virtual and physical networking into a single infrastructure. It provides virtual-machine visibility from the physical network and a consistent network operations model for physical and virtual servers.
Cisco User-Space NIC (usNIC )
The usNIC improves the performance of software applications using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) instead of sockets or other communication APIs. It does this by bypassing the kernel when sending and receiving networking packets. The applications interact directly with the virtual interface card, which improves the networking performance of your high-performance computing application.
Centralized Management by Cisco UCS Manager
These adapters offer support for Microsoft Windows, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux, VMware vSphere, and Citrix XenServer. (Note: The 1227T card must be connected to a 10BASE-T Cisco Nexus 2232TM-E 10GE Fabric Extender.)
Simplify Data Center Cabling
Cisco SingleConnect technology unifies LAN, SAN, and systems management.

Specifications at a Glance
Feature Benefit
x8 PCIe Gen2 interfaces Delivers greater throughput
2 x 10-Gbps unified I/O
Delivers 20 Gbps to the server
Helps reduce TCO by consolidating the overall number of NICs, HBAs, cables, and switches
Up to 256 dynamic virtual adapters and interfaces
Creates fully functional, independent PCIe adapters and interfaces (NICs or HBAs) without requiring single-root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) support from OSs or hypervisors
Creates a highly flexible I/O environment needing only one card for all I/O configurations
Note: The 1227T hardware is SR-IOV capable, and you can use SR-IOV after SR-IOV becomes broadly supported by the popular operating systems.
Advanced features support NetQueue
N-port ID virtualization
Capability to flow steering, segment coalescing, and side scaling
SR-IOV, user-space NIC, and Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM)
Virtual Machine Fabric Extender, VMDirectPath, and Virtual Machine Queue (VMQ)
