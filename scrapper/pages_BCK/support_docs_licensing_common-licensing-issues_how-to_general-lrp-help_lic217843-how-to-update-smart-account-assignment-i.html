Introduction
This article describes the process of updating Smart account assignment in an existing order in Cisco Commerce Workspace (CCW).
Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure that you have the following data at your disposal:
Active Cisco.com account
Sales order number with the status other than SHIPPED. Once your order is in the SHIPPED status, the system already provisioned the license to the account that you had provided. If you edit the Smart account assignment in CCW at this stage, the system cannot transfer the license to another account anymore. To transfer the license to another account, you need to contact Cisco Global Licensing Operations (GLO) by opening a case inSupport Case Manager (SCM).
Updating Smart Account Assignment in CCW
Step 1:
Go to Cisco Commerce Workspace and log in with your Cisco.com account.
Step 2:
From the menu bar, select Orders, and then View All.
Step result: The system displays a page with results for all orders.
Step 3:
On the page with results for all orders, search by one of the options in the Sales Order No. drop-down list, and then enter the value for your selected option. For the purpose of this article, the Sales Order No. option is selected. Press Enter.
Step result: The system displays the order relevant to your search criteria.
Step 4:
In the Saler Order No. column, click the hyperlink to view your order.
Step result: The system displays the order details.
Step 5:
On the order details page, in the warning message, click View or change Smart Account Assignments.
Step result: The system displays the Order page with an option to edit the Smart account assignments.
Step 6:
On the Order page, in the Smart Account section, click the pencil icon next to End Customer Smart Account and/or Holding Smart Account depending on which item you need to update. 
Step result: The system displays the Assign Smart Account dialog box.
Caution: The partner can originally assign the sales order to the Holding Smart Account, however this assignment is only temporary and so this assignment does not provision the license. To provision the license to the actual account, the partner needs to manually reassign the sales order from the Holding Smart Account to End Customer Smart Account. The license can get automatically provisioned to the End Customer Smart Account from Holding Smart Account. This process is triggered by the customer registering the device to a Smart account and the system consequently creating a product instance (PI). Since the order includes the serial number of PI, the system automatically assigns the order to the Smart account to which the device was registered and on which the PI was created. 
Step 7:
In theAssign Smart Accountdialog box, in the Options drop-down list, clickSelect an Existing Account. In theSearch bydrop-down list, selectDomain Identifier, and then enter the name of your Smart account in the search box. In theVirtual Account Name drop-down list, select the name of your Virtual account. ClickAssign.
Note: You can also assign your sales order to a Smart account with the Pending status, however the license will be provisioned only once the status of the Smart account becomes Active.
Caution: If the Virtual account contains double-byte characters (for example, Japanese characters), the system does not display such Virtual account in the Virtual Account Name drop-down list. In this case the workaround is to select the DEFAULT Virtual account. Once the license is provisioned into the account, you can then transfer the license from the DEFAULT to the target Virtual account in Cisco Smart Software Manager (CSSM). To transfer the license between Virtual accounts, refer to How to Transfer Licenses Between Virtual Accounts.
Note: Depending on whether you are updating the End Customer Smart Account and/or Holding Smart Account, the system indicates your location by displaying a respective blue ribbon in the Assign Smart Account dialog box. See Figure 1 and Figure 2.
Step result: The system returns to your order. 
Figure 1 - Updating End Customer Smart Account.
Figure 2 - Updating Holding Smart Account.
Step 8:
Back on the Order page, verify that the system reflects your changes in the Smart Account section. Click Submit.
Step result: The system displays the Submit Change alert dialog box with the message that confirms whether you want to proceed with the submission.
Step 9:
In the Submit Change alert dialog box, click Yes.
Step result: The system saves your changes in Smart account assignment.
