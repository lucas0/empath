Verifying That a Smart License Is Deposited to a Smart Account
Step 1: 
Go to Cisco Software Central and log in with your Cisco.com account.
Step 2:
In theSmart Software Managersection, clickManage licenses.
Step 3:
On the menu bar, click Activity. On the License Transactions tab, in the search bar, enter the sales order number which you associated to a Smart Account, and then press Enter or click the magnifying glass icon.
Step result: The system displays results that match the search criteria which is also a verification that the Smart license is deposited to your Smart Account.
Note: If the system displays no results for that specific sales order, then you should search for the sales order on the Convert to Smart Licensing tab since you may have ordered a Hybrid license.
Step 4:
Click the Transaction Date hyperlink of the license that you want to view.
Step result: The system displays the Transaction dialog box that contains transaction details specific to that particular license.
Step 5:
In the Transaction dialog box, you can view detailed information about the license that you ordered.
Note: If the license is deposited to the incorrect Virtual account, you need to transfer the license between Virtual accounts.
Troubleshooting
If you experience any issue during the verification process, open a case in Support Case Manager (SCM).
