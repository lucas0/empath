Introduction
This document describes the feature matrix for the FlexConnect feature on the Wireless LAN Controller (WLC).
Prerequisites
Requirements
Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:
Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) protocol
Configuration of lightweight Access Points (APs) and Cisco WLCs
Components Used
The information in this document is based on CUWN Releases 7.0.116.0 and later. This article has been updated with Release 8.8
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command.
Background Information 
FlexConnect
FlexConnect is a wireless solution for branch office and remote office deployments. It enables you to configure and control APs in a branch or remote office from the corporate office through a WAN link without the deployment of a controller in each office. The FlexConnect APs can switch client data traffic locally and perform client authentication locally. When they are connected to the controller, they can also send traffic back to the controller. FlexConnect is only supported on these components:
700, 1130AG, 1140, 1240AG, 1250, 1700, 1810, 1815, 1830, 1840, 1850,  AP801, 1600, 1700, 2600, 2700,2800, 3500I, 3500E, 3600, 3700, 3800, 1040, 1520, 1530, 1550, 1560,1570, and 1260 APs
Cisco Flex 8500 and 7500, Cisco 5500, 3504,vWLC, and 2500 Series Controllers
Catalyst 3750G Integrated WLC Switch
Cisco WiSM and WiSM2
Controller Network Module for Integrated Services Routers
FlexConnect local authentication is useful where you cannot maintain a remote office setup with a minimum bandwidth of 128 kb/s and a round-trip latency of no greater than 100 ms. The maximum tolerated latency for FlexConnect is 300 ms, regardless of the features that are used.
The next section outlines the FlexConnect Feature Matrix.
Note: Pre-802, 11n APs, such as 1130 or 1240, are still supported by later code. However, these APs do not receive new features as of Release 7.3. Therefore, these APs do not support FlexConnect features that appear after Release 7.3. Similarly, first generation 802.11n APs do not have any of the FlexConnect features of the 8.1 feature set even if they are able to join such a WLC. Refer to the release notes for more information.
Note: 802.11ac wave 2 APs and Catalyst APs are covered by this document which supersedes this matrix which focuses only on AireOS releases : https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/access_point/feature-matrix/ap-feature-matrix.html

(1) Yes for clients that have association at Connected mode.
(2) FlexConnect Access Control Lists (ACLs) must be used. Note that flex ACLs are not supported on the AP native VLAN!
(3) Limits/exclusion done by WLC so client is deauthorized after a successful Association Response.
(4) Note that the per-user ACL on FlexConnect does not override a VLAN ACL on flex AP like it would override a WLAN ACL on local mode AP. If both per user-ACL is pushed and AAA-VLAN ACL configured on the flex group, both take effect.
(5)With FlexConnect local switching, Multicast is forwarded only for the VLAN that the SSID is mapped to and not to any overridden VLANs. Therefore, IPv6 does not work as expected because Multicast traffic is forwarded from the incorrect VLAN. Therefore vlan assignment is not supported on local switching with ipv6
Note: At any given point, an AP has a maximum of 16 VLANs. First, the VLANs are selected as per the AP configuration (WLAN-VLAN), and then the remaining VLANs are pushed from the FlexConnect group in the order that they are configured or displayed in the FlexConnect group. If the VLAN slots are full, an error message is displayed

The passive client feature is not supported on Flex APs. However, the APs do not do proxy ARP by default on FlexConnect (and that is a part of the passive client feature). On the contrary, proxy ARP was added as a feature for FlexConnect APs with Release 8.0 and later.
(1) Provided if the Lead AP is already upgraded and member APs are updated with their Lead AP.

(2) Only on second generation 11n APs and later (1600, 2600, 3600, and so on).
(3) FlexConnect APs do not send (re)association responses with status 17 for load-balancing as do Local mode APs; instead, they first send (re)association responses with status 0 (success) and then deauth with reason 5. This occurs as the AP handles the association locally and load-balancing decisions are taken at the WLC.
Mobility / Roaming Scenarios
WLAN
Configuration Local Switching Central Switching
CCKM PMK (OKC) Others CCKM PMK (OKC) Others
Mobility Between Same Flex Group Fast Roam(1) Fast Roam(1) Full Auth(1) Fast Roam Fast Roam Full Auth
Mobility Between Different Flex Group Full Auth Fast Roam Full Auth Full Auth Fast Roam Full Auth
Inter Controller Mobility N/A N/A N/A Full Auth Fast Roam Full Auth
(1) Provided WLAN is mapped to the same VLAN (same subnet). If WLAN is mapped to different subnets, no fast roaming can occur as the client has to obtain a new IP address.
Note: FT/802.11r fast roaming also requires APs to be in the same FlexGroup. Only WPA2 OKC, which happens at the WLC level, can tolerate APs to be in different FlexConnect groups for fast roaming.
Note: In order to support centralized access control through a centralized Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server, such as the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) or ACS, the IPv6 ACL can be provisioned on a per-client basis with the use of AAA Override attributes. In order to use this feature, the IPv6 ACL must be configured on the controller, and the WLAN must be configured with the AAA Override feature enabled. The AAA attribute for an IPv6 ACL is Airespace-IPv6-ACL-Name, similar to the Airespace-ACL-Name attribute used in order to provision an IPv4-based ACL. The AAA attribute-returned contents must be a string that is equal to the name of the IPv6 ACL, as configured on the controller.
