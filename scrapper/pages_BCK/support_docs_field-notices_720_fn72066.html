CSCvw92855 There were no defects filed with this field notice at the time of publication.
Problem Description
When AP.xsp.22.0.1123.ap367291 or AP.xsp.23.0.1075.ap367291 is applied on the eXtended Service Platform (XSP), eXtended Services Interface (XSI) web error responses are HTML escaped.
Background
Note: This field notice was originally posted in the BroadSoft Xchange portal and has been moved over to Cisco.com as-is for historical purposes.
Problem Symptom
The original intent of AP367291 is to harden the validation of incoming XSI request and error responses to malicious requests by performing an HTML escape on the response content. Once the patch is applied, some error scenarios will result in a “bad request error” message being received instead of the error message that describes the issue.
Workaround/Solution
BroadWorks patches can now be downloaded through the Cisco Software Download Center after logging in with your Cisco.com (CCO) account.
The version of BroadWorks that is currently deployed as well as the patches currently activated can be checked by executing the get versions all command from the CLI. More information on how to check the patch level can be found in the Cisco BroadWorks Maintenance Guide.
Workaround
AP.xsp.22.0.1123.ap367291 or AP.xsp.23.0.1075.ap367291 can be removed from the impacted server.
Patch
AP.xsp.22.0.1123.ap373108 and AP.xsp.23.0.10175.ap373108 are now available on Xchange for this issue. Apply the applicable patch on the impacted servers.
