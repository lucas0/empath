Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCvx82319 NCS1002: NTT SPDCSCO-49G Z1 (341-100443-02) shipped with wrong FW version.
Problem Description
A limited number of NCS1K-2KW-DC, Power Supply Units (PSUs), with HW Version VID 02, shipped with an incorrect Firmware might report the FW upgrade flag continuously.
Background
During manufacturing, a limited number of the PSUs with Hardware (HW) Version ID (VID) 02 were incorrectly loaded with the FW Version 1.14, instead of FW Version 2.01. This will cause FW mismatch alarm.
Cisco IOS® XR releases 7.0.1 and later verifies the PSU VID 01 with FW 1.14 and VID 02 with FW 2.01. The FW mismatch alarm will be raised if the PSU VID and FW version are not same as mentioned above.
Software Releases earlier than 7.0.1 do not recognize FW Version 2.01, so they do not raise any alarms.
Problem Symptom
Cisco IOS XR software detects FW compatibility via the TAN HW version. The possible combinations are:
For VID 01 PSU - HW version read : 0.1
For VID 02 PSU - HW version read : 0.2

0/PM0     NCS1K-2KW-DC      0.1   PO-PriMCU            CURRENT    1.14    1.14
0/PM1     NCS1K-2KW-DC      0.2   PO-PriMCU            CURRENT    2.01    2.01
This combination of the HW version and FW version will lead to a FW Mismatch Alarm :

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An example of a log file with the error is shown here. All of the devices run Cisco IOS XR Software Release 7.1.1.

After an upgrade to 0/PM0 with the upgrade hw-module location 0/PM0 fpd all force command, the status changes to "RLOAD REQ".
After a reload with the admin hw-module location all reload command and a reboot, the status changes back to "NEED UPGD".
In Summary:
Cisco IOS XR Software Releases 7.0.1 and later do not allow you to upgrade the PSU. It goes to "UPGD SKIP" or "RLOAD REQ" and if reloaded, goes back to the "NEED UPGD" state.
Cisco IOS XR releases earlier than Software Release 7.0.1 do not detect any inconsistency.
