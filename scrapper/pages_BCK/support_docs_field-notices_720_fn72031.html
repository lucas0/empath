Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCvf34445 There were no defects filed with this field notice at the time of publication.
Problem Description
AP372533 and Release 24 incorrectly changed the behavior in regards to the blocking of incoming calls when Session Admission Control (SAC) is at maximum capacity, countBWAnywhereForSACSubscriber is set to "true" in the CLI under /Service/SessionAdmissionControl and count intra-group calls is disabled. In this case only the call to the Broadworks Anywhere (BWAnywhere) device will be released, but the call to the primary or Shared Call Appearance (SCAP) devices will be allowed. The correct behavior is to release the whole call.
Background
Note: This field notice was originally posted in the BroadSoft Xchange portal and has been moved over to Cisco.com as-is for historical purposes.
Problem Symptom
BWAnywhere users will have their other devices alerted for intra-group calls when countBWAnywhereForSACSubscriber is set to "true"; whereas the call should have been released entirely since the maximum session count was reached.
Workaround/Solution
BroadWorks patches can now be downloaded through the Cisco Software Download Center after logging in with your Cisco.com (CCO) account.
The version of BroadWorks that is currently deployed as well as the patches currently activated can be checked by executing the get versions all command from the CLI. More information on how to check the patch level can be found in the Cisco BroadWorks Maintenance Guide.
Workaround
There is no workaround.
Patch
Apply patch AP377091 which will revert this behavior change unless the bw.sac.releaseBWAnywhereDeviceOnly execution container is added and set to "true".
