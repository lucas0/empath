CSCvx32766 BEMS01198747 Verizon Security Scan Issues with BW SUDOERS Configuration on XSP
Problem Description
After Cisco BroadWorks servers are prepatched with ap378332, scripts and tasks that rely on the sudoers file might fail to execute as expected.
Background
When a Cisco BroadWorks server is prepatched with any of these patches, the system will fail to correctly execute tasks and scripts that rely on the sudoers file until a sudo password is provided.
AP.platform.22.0.1123.ap378332
AP.platform.23.0.1075.ap378332
AP.as.24.0.944.ap378332
Problem Symptom
Customers might notice that basic monitoring scripts, such as healthmon, do not execute as expected and prompt for a sudo password in order to continue.
Workaround/Solution
Workaround
If the patch was applied on a running release (not through a prepatch), then no further action is required.
For customers that have already prepatched their servers and experience the sudoers issue, it is recommended to not remove the patch and instead execute this script in order to correct the issue:
sudo /usr/local/broadworks/bw_base/sbin/update_sudoers.pl
Solution
These Cisco BroadWorks patches have been rereleased to include a fix that prevents this issue. Customers who have already prepatched their servers are advised to remove the old patch and reapply the patch using the rereleased version.
