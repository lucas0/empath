Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCve95308 IR809 sensitivity to fluctuating battery power source
CSCvc95052 IR809 fails to boot up despite several power cycle attempts
CSCvf39847 IR8x9 may fail if powered by battery with no charge controller
CSCvf74520 IR829 would always reload instead of powering down despite the lack of ignition signal
Problem Description
IR809 and IR829 routers might not boot up despite repeated power cycle attempts.
Issue 1 - Affects Some Battery Applications
Some IR809 or IR829 routers might not power down completely during a power down stage, especially when a backup battery is used to provide backup power.
This issue is more likely to occur if the customer uses batteries to power IR809 and IR829 routers.
Exceptions:
Customers who use a constant voltage power source instead of batteries are NOT impacted by this issue.
IR809 customers who use batteries, but also use an external charge controller to set a proper undervoltage threshold for IR809 are NOT impacted by this issue.
IR829 customers who set a proper undervoltage threshold setting for IR829 in order to prevent batteries from draining below the minimum output voltage of the battery are NOT impacted by this issue.
Issue 2 - Affects Some Vehicle Applications
Some IR829 routers installed in vehicles might not shut down completely when the router's ignition management is enabled and the vehicle's ignition switch is in the OFF position.
Background
Issue 1 - Affects Some Battery Applications
Some IR809 or IR829 routers might not power down completely during a power down stage, especially when a backup battery is used to provide backup power. If a power down cycle is incomplete or an unmonitored battery discharges gradually to the point where its performance is impacted (in the voltage region where it produces large voltage fluctuations), this process produces multiple power cycle swings until the battery eventually drains below the minimum input voltage of the router. The router eventually shuts down and becomes unresponsive to subsequent power up attempts.
Note: Typically, a rechargeable battery should never be allowed to drop below 10.5V for a 12V battery or below 21V for a 24V battery, as that is normally the voltage most common rechargeable batteries (lead-acid and lithium-Ion) assign a 0% state of charge. A drop below these values can affect the router and also significantly reduce the charge capacity and eventually the service life of the battery, especially lead-acid batteries. Undervoltage thresholds should therefore be set accordingly.
Issue 2 - Affects Some Vehicle Applications
Some IR829 routers installed in vehicles might not shut down completely when the router's ignition management is enabled, and the vehicle's ignition switch is in the OFF position. Instead, the router will shut down momentarily and then automatically power up again, even though the vehicle's ignition switch is in the OFF position. This power off/on cycle repeats itself until the vehicle's ignition switch is back in the ON position.
Problem Symptom
Issue 1 - Affects Some Battery Applications
The router and console ports become unresponsive.
Issue 2 - Affects Some Vehicle Applications
The router will shut down momentarily and then automatically power up again, even though the vehicle's ignition switch is in the OFF position. This power off/on cycle repeats itself until the vehicle's ignition switch is back in the ON position.
Workaround/Solution
There is no workaround. The solution is to upgrade the software as follows:
On IR809 routers, upgrade to a Cisco IOS® 15.6(3)M3, 15.7(3)M, or 15.8(3)M0a or later release.
On IR829 routers, upgrade to a Cisco IOS 15.6(3)M4, 15.7(3)M1, or 15.8(3)M0a or later release.
If your IR809 or IR829 router does NOT boot, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC).
