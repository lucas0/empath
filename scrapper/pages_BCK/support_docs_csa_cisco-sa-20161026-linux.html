Details
Linux Kernel Memory Subsystem Copy-on-Write Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the memory manager functions of the Linux Kernel could allow unauthenticated, local attackers to gain write access to otherwise read-only memory mappings to increase their privileges on the system.

The vulnerability is due to a race condition in the memory manager functions of the Linux Kernel. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by racing the madvise (MADV_DONTNEED) system call. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain write access to otherwise read-only memory mappings. A local user could modify on-disk binaries, bypassing the standard permission mechanisms.
Workarounds
Any available workarounds are documented in the Cisco bugs for each affected product, which are given in the Vulnerable Products table and also accessible from the Cisco Bug Search Tool.
Fixed Software
Cisco will release free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page, to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
Exploitation and Public Announcements
The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory against Cisco Products.
