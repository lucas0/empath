Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) FAQ
Question Answer
What is RoHS? "RoHS" stands for "Restriction of Hazardous Substances." It refers to regulations, typically passed at a country, state or provincial level laying down rules on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) with a view to contributing to the protection of human health and the environment, including the environmentally sound recovery and disposal of waste EEE. With the rapidly expanding use of EEE globally and the resulting growth in waste EEE, more and more jurisdictions are enacting RoHS regulations.
What is Cisco's position on RoHS? Read the Cisco position on RoHS. Cisco closely monitors developing RoHS legislation globally. Cisco and Cisco products supplied by Cisco meet applicable RoHS requirements. Cisco will ensure continuous compliance with applicable requirements, including measures that amend or supersede those.
What is Cisco's approach to continuous compliance? Cisco has robust compliance processes and infrastructure in place. In the context of RoHS, Cisco adheres to the European Harmonized standard EN IEC 63000 developed by the European Standardization Body CENELEC to, among others, provide presumption of conformity with RoHS requirements. Cisco is strongly committed to continue working with customers and its supply chain to implement applicable RoHS requirements as they continue to evolve, and help ensure continuous compliance.
