Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCwd80290 IOS AP image validation certificate failed/expired, causing AP join issues.
Problem Description
Cisco IOS®-based Access Points (APs) that use expired certificates for image validation as of December 5, 2022 could cause Cisco IOS AP image downloads from a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) to fail, which prevents the AP from joining the controller.
This affects all Cisco lightweight APs that run Cisco IOS, which include: 802.11ac Wave 1 APs (IW3702/3700/2700/1700/1570 series) and earlier APs including 700/1530/1550/3600/2600/1600/3500/AP802/AP803 series. The affected lightweight Cisco IOS images were built from December 2012 through November 2022.
Background
Cisco IOS-based APs use a certificate to validate the software image that has been downloaded and installed from the controller before installing that software on the AP. Because this certificate expired on December 5, 2022, validation will fail and the AP will not install the newly downloaded image. The AP will continue to try to download and validate this image, and will continue to fail indefinitely until a workaround or solution is applied.
Cisco Aironet 802.11ac Wave 2 and Catalyst Wi-Fi6/6E Access Point and later APs are not affected by this issue.
For more detail, see IOS AP Image Download Fails Due to Expired Image Signing Certificate Post December 4th, 2022 (CSCwd80290).
Problem Symptom
Affected APs will remain in the downloading state and never complete their join to the WLC. For a more detailed description of the symptom, see IOS AP Image Download Fails Due to Expired Image Signing Certificate Post December 4th, 2022 (CSCwd80290).
Workaround/Solution
This issue does not require hardware replacement.
Solution
Upgrade your WLC to one of the versions in the "Upgrading to Fixed Software" section in IOS AP Image Download Fails Due to Expired Image Signing Certificate Post December 4th, 2022 (CSCwd80290).
Workaround
For any WLC that has APs stuck in the downloading state:
Disable Network Time Protocol (NTP) on the WLC and manually set the WLC date/time to a date before December 2, 2022. The Cisco IOS AP will then be able to download and validate the image, install the new image, and join the controller. Once the AP has joined the controller, NTP can be re-enabled on the controller to assume the correct date and time.
Customers who receive a replacement Cisco IOS-based AP(s) from Cisco via Return Material Authorization (RMA)/Warranty and have not upgraded their WLC(s) to a fixed software version should go through this workaround. For more details, see IOS AP Image Download Fails Due to Expired Image Signing Certificate Post December 4th, 2022 (CSCwd80290).
