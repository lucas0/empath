Release Notes for the Cisco ASA Series, 9.12(x)
This document contains release information for Cisco ASA software Version 9.12(x).
Important Notes
ASDM signed-image support in 9.12(4.50)/7.18(1.152) and later—The ASA now validates whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed image. If you try to run an older ASDM image with an ASA version with this fix, ASDM will be blocked and the message “%ERROR: Signature not valid for file disk0:/<filename>” will be displayed at the ASA CLI. ASDM release 7.18(1.152) and later are backwards compatible with all ASA versions, even those without this fix. (CSCwb05291, CSCwb05264)
Upgrade ROMMON for ASA 5506-X, 5508-X, and 5516-X to Version 1.1.15 or later—There is a new ROMMON version for these ASA models (May 15, 2019); we highly recommend that you upgrade to the latest version. To upgrade, see the instructions in the ASA configuration guide.

Caution
The ROMMON upgrade for 1.1.15 takes twice as long as previous ROMMON versions, approximately 15 minutes. Do not power cycle the device during the upgrade. If the upgrade is not complete within 30 minutes or it fails, contact Cisco technical support; do not power cycle or reset the device.
Upgrade ROMMON for the ISA 3000 to Version 1.0.5 or later——There is a new ROMMON version for the ISA 3000 (May 15, 2019); we highly recommend that you upgrade to the latest version. To upgrade, see the instructions in the ASA configuration guide.
Caution: The ROMMON upgrade for 1.0.5 takes twice as long as previous ROMMON versions, approximately 15 minutes. Do not power cycle the device during the upgrade. If the upgrade is not complete within 30 minutes or it fails, contact Cisco technical support; do not power cycle or reset the device.
SSH security improvements and new defaults in 9.12(1)—See the following SSH security improvements:
SSH version 1 is no longer supported; only version 2 is supported. The ssh version 1 command will be migrated to ssh version 2 .
Diffie-Hellman Group 14 SHA256 key exchange support. This setting is now the default (ssh key-exchange group dh-group14-sha256 ). The former default was Group 1 SHA1. Make sure that your SSH client supports Diffie-Hellman Group 14 SHA256. If it does not, you may see an error such as "Couldn't agree on a key exchange algorithm." For example, OpenSSH supports Diffie-Hellman Group 14 SHA256.
HMAC-SHA256 integrity cipher support. The default is now the high security set of ciphers (hmac-sha2-256 only as defined by the ssh cipher integrity high command). The former default was the medium set.
Diffie-Hellman Group 1 Removal in 9.12(1)— Diffie-Hellman Group 1 used by the ASA IKE and IPsec modules is considered insecure and has been removed.
IKEv1: The following subcommands were removed:
crypto ikev1 policy priority:
group 1
IKEv2: The following subcommands were removed:
crypto ikev2 policy priority
group 1
IPsec: The following subcommands were removed:
crypto ipsec profile name
set pfs group1
SSL: The following commands were removed:
ssl dh-group group1
Crypto Map: The following commands were removed:
crypto map name sequence set pfs group1
crypto dynamic-map name sequence set pfs group1
crypto map name sequence set ikev1 phase1-mode aggressive group1
No support in 9.10(1) and later for the ASA FirePOWER module on the ASA 5506-X series and the ASA 5512-X—The ASA 5506-X series and 5512-X no longer support the ASA FirePOWER module in 9.10(1) and later due to memory constraints. You must remain on 9.9(x) or lower to continue using this module. Other module types are still supported. If you upgrade to 9.10(1) or later, the ASA configuration to send traffic to the FirePOWER module will be erased; make sure to back up your configuration before you upgrade. The FirePOWER image and its configuration remains intact on the SSD. If you want to downgrade, you can copy the ASA configuration from the backup to restore functionality.
The NULL-SHA TLSv1 cipher is deprecated and removed in 9.12(1)—Because NULL-SHA doesn't offer encryption and is no longer considered secure against modern threats, it will be removed when listing supported ciphers for TLSv1 in the output of tls-proxy mode commands/options and show ssl ciphers all . The ssl cipher tlsv1 all and ssl cipher tlsv1 custom NULL-SHA commands will also be deprecated and removed.
Local CA server is deprecated in 9.12(1), and will be removed in a later release—When ASA is configured as local CA server, it is enabled to issue digital certificates, publish Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), and securely revoke issued certificates. This feature has become obsolete and hence the crypto ca server command is deprecated.
The default trustpool is removed in 9.12(1)—In order to comply with PSB requirement, SEC-AUT-DEFROOT, the "default" trusted CA bundle is removed from the ASA image. As a result, crypto ca trustpool import default and crypto ca trustpool import clean default commands are also removed along with other related logic. However, in existing deployments, certificates that were previously imported using these command will remain in place.
The ssl encryption command is removed in 9.12(1)—In 9.3(2) the deprecation was announced and replaced by ssl cipher . In 9.12(1), ssl encryption is removed and no longer supported.

New/Modified commands: ssh key-exchange
New Features in ASA 9.12(1)
Released: March 13, 2019
Feature
Description
Platform Features
ASA for the Firepower 4115, 4125, and 4145
We introduced the Firepower 4115, 4125, and 4145.
Requires FXOS 2.6.1.
No modified commands.
Support for ASA and FTD on separate modules of the same Firepower 9300
You can now deploy ASA and FTD logical devices on the same Firepower 9300.
Requires FXOS 2.6.1.
No modified commands.
Firepower 9300 SM-40 and SM-48 support
We introduced the following two security modules: SM-40 and SM-48.
Requires FXOS 2.6.1.
No modified commands.
Firewall Features
GTPv1 release 10.12 support.
The system now supports GTPv1 release 10.12. Previously, the system supported release 6.1. The new support includes recognition of 25 additional GTPv1 messages and 66 information elements.
In addition, there is a behavior change. Now, any unknown message IDs are allowed. Previously, unknown messages were dropped and logged.
No modified commands.
Cisco Umbrella Enhancements.
You can now identify local domain names that should bypass Cisco Umbrella. DNS requests for these domains go directly to the DNS servers without Umbrella processing. You can also identify which Umbrella servers to use for resolving DNS requests. Finally, you can define the Umbrella inspection policy to fail open, so that DNS requests are not blocked if the Umbrella server is unavailable.
New/Modified commands: local-domain-bypass , resolver , umbrella fail-open .
The object group search threshold is now disabled by default.
If you enabled object group search, the feature was subject to a threshold to help prevent performance degradation. That threshold is now disabled by default. You can enable it by using the object-group-search threshold command.
New/Modified command: object-group-search threshold .
Interim logging for NAT port block allocation.
When you enable port block allocation for NAT, the system generates syslog messages during port block creation and deletion. If you enable interim logging, the system generates message 305017 at the interval you specify. The messages report all active port blocks allocated at that time, including the protocol (ICMP, TCP, UDP) and source and destination interface and IP address, and the port block.
New/Modified command: xlate block-allocation pba-interim-logging seconds .
VPN Features
New condition option for debug aaa .
The condition option was added to the debug aaa command. You can use this option to filter VPN debugging based on group name, user name, or peer IP address.
New/Modified commands: debug aaa condition
Support for RSA SHA-1 in IKEv2
You can now generate a signature using the RSA SHA-1 hashing algorithm for IKEv2.
New/Modified commands: rsa-sig-sha1
View the default SSL configuration for both DES and 3DES encryption licenses as well as available ciphers
You can now view the default SSL configuration with and without the 3DES encryption license. In addition, you can view all the ciphers supported on the device.
New/Modified commands: show ssl information
Add subdomains to webVPN HSTS
Allows domain owners to submit what domains should be included in the HSTS preload list for web browsers.
New/Modified commands: hostname(config-webvpn) includesubdomains
High Availability and Scalability Features
Per-site gratuitous ARP for clustering
The ASA now generates gratuitous ARP (GARP) packets to keep the switching infrastructure up to date: the highest priority member at each site periodically generates GARP traffic for the global MAC/IP addresses. When using per-site MAC and IP addresses, packets sourced from the cluster use a site-specific MAC address and IP address, while packets received by the cluster use a global MAC address and IP address. If traffic is not generated from the global MAC address periodically, you could experience a MAC address timeout on your switches for the global MAC address. After a timeout, traffic destined for the global MAC address will be flooded across the entire switching infrastructure, which can cause performance and security concerns. GARP is enabled by default when you set the site ID for each unit and the site MAC address for each Spanned EtherChannel.
New/Modified commands: site-periodic-garp interval
Multiple context mode HTTPS resource management
You can now set the maximum number of non-ASDM HTTPS sessions in a resource class. By default, the limit is set to 6 per context, the maximum. You can use up to 100 HTTPS sesssions across all contexts.
New/Modified commands: limit-resource http
Routing Features
OSPF Keychain support for authentication
OSPF authenticates the neighbor and route updates using MD5 keys. In ASA, the keys that are used to generate the MD5 digest had no lifetime associated with it. Thus, user intervention was required to change the keys periodically. To overcome this limitation, OSPFv2 supports MD5 authentication with rotating keys.
Based on the accept and send lifetimes of Keys in KeyChain, OSPF authenticates, accepts or rejects keys and forms adjacency.
New/Modified commands: accept-lifetime , area virtual-link authentication , cryptographic-algorithm , key , key chain , key-string , ospf authentication , send-lifetime
Certificate Features
Local CA configurable FQDN for enrollment URL
To make the FQDN of the enrollment URL configurable instead of using the ASA's configured FQDN, a new CLI option is introduced. This new option is added to the smpt mode of crypto ca server .
New/Modified commands: fqdn
Administrative, Monitoring, and Troubleshooting Features
enable password change now required on a login
The default enable password is blank. When you try to access privileged EXEC mode on the ASA, you are now required to change the password to a value of 3 characters or longer. You cannot keep it blank. The no enable password command is no longer supported.
At the CLI, you can access privileged EXEC mode using the enable command, the login command (with a user at privilege level 2+), or an SSH or Telnet session when you enable aaa authorization exec auto-enable . All of these methods require you to set the enable password.
This password change requirement is not enforced for ASDM logins. In ASDM, by default you can log in without a username and with the enable password.
New/Modified commands: enable password
Configurable limitation of admin sessions
You can configure the maximum number of aggregate, per user, and per-protocol administrative sessions. Formerly, you could configure only the aggregate number of sessions. This feature does not affect console sessions. Note that in multiple context mode, you cannot configure the number of HTTPS sessions, where the maximum is fixed at 5 sessions. The quota management-session command is also no longer accepted in the system configuration, and is instead available in the context configuration. The maximum aggregate sessions is now 15; if you configured 0 (unlimited) or 16+, then when you upgrade, the value is changed to 15.
New/Modified commands: quota management-session , show quota management-session
Notifications for administrative privilege level changes
When you authenticate for enable access (aaa authentication enable console) or allow privileged EXEC access directly (aaa authorization exec auto-enable ), then the ASA now notifies users if their assigned access level has changed since their last login.
New/Modified commands: show aaa login-history
NTP support on IPv6
You can now specify an IPv6 address for the NTP server.
New/Modified commands: ntp server
SSH stronger security
See the following SSH security improvements:
Diffie-Hellman Group 14 SHA256 key exchange support. This setting is now the default. The former default was Group 1 SHA1.
HMAC-SHA256 integrity cipher support. The default is now the high security set of ciphers (hmac-sha2-256 only). The former default was the medium set.
New/Modified commands: ssh cipher integrity , ssh key-exchange group dh-group14-sha256
Allow non-browser-based HTTPS clients to access the ASA
You can allow non-browser-based HTTPS clients to access HTTPS services on the ASA. By default, ASDM, CSM, and REST API are allowed.
New/Modified commands: http server basic-auth-client
Capture control plane packets only on the cluster control link
You can now capture control plane packets only on the cluster control link (and no data plane packets). This option is useful in the system in multiple context mode where you cannot match traffic using an ACL.
New/Modified commands: capture interface cluster cp-cluster
debug conn command
The debug conn command was added to provide two history mechanisms that record connection processing. The first history list is a per-thread list that records the operations of the thread. The second history list is a list that records the operations into the conn-group. When a connection is enabled, processing events such as a connection lock, unlock, and delete are recorded into the two history lists. When a problem occurs, these two lists can be used to look back at the processing to determine the incorrect logic.
New/Modified commands: debug conn
show tech-support includes additional output
The output of the show tech-support is enhanced to display the output of the following:
show ipv6 interface
show aaa-server
show fragment
New/Modified commands: show tech-support
