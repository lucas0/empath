Introduction
This article describes the process of verifying that a product activation key (PAK) is assigned to a Smart account.
Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure that you have the following data at your disposal:
Active Cisco.com account
PAK and PIN
Admin or User access to a Smart Account (To request access to a Smart account or Virtual account, refer to How to Request Access to an Existing Smart Account.)
Verifying That a PAK Is Assigned to a Smart Account
Step 1: 
Go to Cisco Software Central and log in with your Cisco.com account.
Step 2:
In the Traditional Licenses section, click Access LRP.
Step 3: 
In the Show Smart Account and Virtual Account drop-down lists, confirm that the correct respective accounts are selected.
Note: If the system displays the Welcome To The License Registration Portal alert dialog box, you can select Do not show this message again to prevent it from being displayed again.
Step 4:
On the PAKs or Tokens tab, click Show Filter, and then enter the product activation key (PAK) in the PAK/Token field. Press Enter.
Step result: The system displays the product activation key (PAK) if it is assigned to the selected Smart account (see Figure 1).
Note: If the product activation key (PAK) is not assigned to your Smart account, the system displays the No PAKs found message. To assign a product activation key (PAK) to your Smart account, you need to add a new product activation key (PAK) to your Smart Account.
Figure 1 - The system displays the search results for the PAK.
Troubleshooting
If you experience an issue while verifying that a product activation key (PAK) is assigned to a Smart Account, open a case in Support Case Manager (SCM).
