Document history
    Rich digital experiences need always-on, local, high-performance computing that is close to users. Retail, finance, education, healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing organizations, and remote and branch offices in general, are all pushing computing to the network edge. Cisco HyperFlex™ Edge Nodes bring the robust feature set of Cisco HyperFlex systems to your edge environments with low-cost, easy-to-deploy, cloud-managed solutions.
Designed for the edge
While enterprise applications have been migrating to centralized data centers and to the cloud, the Internet edge has been moving to branch and remote locations closer to user devices and organizational touchpoints. Cisco HyperFlex Edge Nodes are designed to work in simplified two- to four-node clusters using existing 1, 10, and 25 Gigabit Ethernet networks. These nodes are available in one-rack-unit (1RU) hybrid and all-flash, two-rack-unit (2RU) hybrid and all flash, and 2RU short-depth form factors. With the same easy deployment and management as all Cisco HyperFlex systems, Cisco HyperFlex Edge Nodes deliver the power of hyperconvergence to a multitude of edge locations, or can act as the sole cluster supporting a small or medium-size business.
Cisco HyperFlex HX220c Edge M5
Cisco HyperFlex Edge is deployed as a preintegrated cluster with a unified pool of resources that you can quickly provision, adapt, scale, and manage to efficiently power your remote-office and branch-office (ROBO) locations. Physically, the system is delivered as a cluster of three hybrid, all-flash, or all-NVMe nodes that are integrated using your existing Gigabit Ethernet switch (Figure 1). All nodes use Intel® Xeon® Scalable CPUs and next-generation DDR4 memory and offer 12-Gbps SAS throughput. As a result, these sixth-generation servers offer faster processing, more cores, and a faster, larger memory capacity than previous-generation nodes.
