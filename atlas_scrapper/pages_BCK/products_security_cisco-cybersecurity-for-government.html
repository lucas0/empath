Why Cisco Security for government?
At Cisco, we have been helping government agencies of all sizes address their unique security and compliance challenge for decades. We understand the latest threats and how trends in digitization, mobility, IoT, and multicloud affect your cyber profile--and how you don't need another vendor to manage. We get it. You need a security partner you can trust.
That's why we are building the only integrated security platform that simplifies your experience, accelerates your mission's success, and secures your agency's future. You'll find skilled security experts behind our platform who understand government security, compliance requirements, and your unique challenges. We make security technologies work in concert with your staff to raise your cyber profile, mitigate risks, and comply with mandates.
Master the basics of zero trust security
Secure access for your workforce, workloads, and workplace
Zero trust for the workforce
Cisco Duo helps protect users and their devices against stolen credentials, phishing, and other identity-based attacks. It verifies users' identities and establishes device trust before granting access to applications.
Zero trust for workload
Secure your hybrid, multicloud workloads and contain lateral movement with application segmentation from Cisco Tetration.
Zero trust for workplace
Cisco Software-Defined Access (SD-Access) helps you gain insight into users and devices, identify threats, and maintain control over all connections across your network, including Internet of Things devices.
Modernizing government cybersecurity
In May 2021, the White House issued an Executive Order (EO) on "Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity" to modernize government cybersecurity through cloud adoption, better detection, investigation, and response. The executive order aimed to improve threat information sharing, protect critical applications, shore up supply chains, standardize incident response playbooks, and more.
This white paper addresses how Cisco Secure Solutions can answer the president's executive order and improve national cybersecurity. The report also maps Cisco Secure products directly to the requirements laid out in the executive order.
