Defect Information
Defect ID Headline
CSCvf34445 There were no defects filed with this field notice at the time of publication.
Problem Description
Users are unable to log in to the UC-One Connect client with the latest Beta version of iOS 15.
Background
During the test of UC-One Connect with the latest Beta versions of iOS 15, an intermittent issue has been identified which does not allow users to log in to the client. The issue is only seen when the software runs on iOS 15 Beta.
This is applicable for UC-One Connect Collaborate for iOS - all versions earlier than 3.9.24.
Problem Symptom
After upgrading an iPhone to the upcoming iOS version 15, some users might experience a problem which prevents them from being able to log in to the iOS client. This is due to a UI glitch in the iOS client login flow caused by the upgrade of the user’s iPhone to iOS 15.
Workaround/Solution
The issue is resolved in Version 3.9.24, released on 2021-09-02.  
We strongly advise all customers to upgrade to the latest UC-One Connect client version. This will prevent potential field issues with the current client caused by the upcoming release of iOS 15.
The UC-One Connect Eval app is available on the Apple App Store.
Note: The UC-One SaaS and Webex Calling App might also experience the issue. However, these clients will be released on the Apple App store by Cisco prior to the iOS 15 release by Apple.
The released version of the branding kit for Version 3.9.24 is available on Xchange.
