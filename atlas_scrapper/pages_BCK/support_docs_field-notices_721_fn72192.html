CSCvy28871 Premature transceiver failure due to fault on Receive side optical path for SN: ACW
Problem Description
The products, as listed in the Products Affected section, might experience a higher failure rate due to an optical failure on the receiver side of the Quad Small Form-Factor Pluggable (QSFP) 40G LR4 transceivers. This could result in link down failures.
Background
Due to a manufacturing process issue, the detector's optical alignment and performance were inadvertently altered for the impacted QSFP 40G LR4 transceivers. This might cause the impacted QSFP 40G LR4 transceivers to fail prematurely.
Problem Symptom
Observe the digital onboard monitoring optical values on the receiver side of the suspected QSFP 40G LR4 transceiver. A declining trend in that value might indicate that the transceiver is at risk of failing with a link down failure symptom.
Workaround/Solution
Verify whether a particular QSFP 40G LR4 transceiver is affected or not with the Serial Number Validation Tool, which is discussed in the Serial Number Validation section. However, "affected" does not imply that every transceiver will fail.
Additional troubleshooting should be performed in order to confirm the transceiver failure. Link flaps or link down failures can be due to a number of reasons, which include the number of patch panels, lossy or defective cable, poor connections, and occasionally software instability.
If the suspected transceiver exhibits the problem symptoms as mentioned previously and the serial number is found in the affected Serial Number Validation Tool, customers can request replacements for affected product(s) with the order form provided in the Upgrade Program section of this field notice.
How To Identify Affected Products
Visual Inspection
Examine the product label of the device for the serial number.
All impacted products will have a serial number that starts with ACW and a date code that ranges from ACW2415xxxx to ACW2449xxxx.
Replace the transceiver if the receive side fails and the serial number shows "affected" in the Serial Number Validation Tool.
Serial Number Validation
Cisco provides a tool to verify whether a device is impacted by this issue. In order to check the device, enter the device's serial number in the Serial Number Validation Tool.
Note: For security reasons, you must click on the Serial Number Validation Tool link provided in this section to check the serial number for the device. Use of the Serial Number Validation Tool URL external to this field notice will fail.
