  Buying models
Cisco Collaboration Flex Plan Contact Center is only available in a Concurrent Agent buying model for all three deployment models based on a monthly agent commitment.
The on-premises and Hosted Contact Center Express (HCS-CCX) technologies that do not contain the overage feature require a subscription change to increase the agent count. For all other deployment models, the overage feature is included with the product and overage SKUs will automatically be added. Usage for products that include overage will be reported on a monthly basis and any usage in excess of the committed quantities will be billed as overage.
Upon reasonable request from Cisco, you will assist and make information available to Cisco to facilitate verification of the number of SaaS or Software licenses that you have installed, accessed, deployed or activated.

Table 5.        Additional Cisco Collaboration Flex Plan Contact Center agent type considerations
Agent Type Capabilities and Considerations
Descriptions
Agent flexibility
Within a single subscription, mixing is allowed between all deployment models and agent types.
Committed agents
This is applicable for Webex Contact Center, Webex Contact Center Enterprise and Cisco Hosted Collaboration Solution for Contact Center (HCS-CCE). Cisco charges based on a usage model. You have the option to pay for a committed quantity of agents on the order. The committed agent quantity will be used to determine your excess agent usage for each month.
Agent overages1
Cloud and Hosted CCE solutions allow for agent usage in excess of the committed agent quantity selected on the order. Agent overages are calculated each month when the total number of agents used exceeds the total number of purchased committed agents on the order. On a monthly basis, Cisco will bill your reseller for excess usage for the agents used in excess of the number of committed agents on the order.
Maximum cloud provisioned users
Under the cloud deployment, you are allowed a maximum number of users capable of being provisioned. Cisco and your reseller configure this value. Contact your reseller if your capacity needs to be increased.
Note: 1 All agent overages are billed in arrears on a monthly basis to reconcile any usage in excess of the committed agent quantities for applicable products.
Platform
For each Cisco Collaboration Flex Plan Contact Center agent, you will designate one of three deployment models: hosted in Cisco’s cloud infrastructure; deployed on the subscriber’s own premises; or hosted by a Cisco partner.
