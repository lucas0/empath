Kevin's story
It’s never too late to get certified
Until I joined the Marines roughly 30 years ago, I’d never even been on a computer. But my aptitude test indicated I’d make a good communications specialist. So, it was in the Marines where I learned to install and configure networking infrastructure. Eventually, I found my way into the cybersecurity realm. After retiring from the military, I found my first civilian job working at a data center. Then a conversation with a former contact led me to an opportunity in cybersecurity. I had previous experience with endpoint management, anti-virus software, and vulnerability management. It turned out to be the perfect role. Once I settled in, I was eager to expand my networking expertise, so getting certified seemed like the obvious thing to do.

Move fast and wear a lot of hats
Cybersecurity involves so many different things. Especially, when you don't have the staff to keep up with every alert. Because of that, I'm also somewhat of a part-time network engineer. I'll tune the equipment. I’ll conduct risk assessments. I’ll audit policies. If there's an individual that company employees know they can reach out to for answers, I'm usually that guy. Which means I spend a fair amount of time in meetings and chat rooms.
How has being a Cisco certification holder changed your life?
“People always want to know who they're talking to. They want to know if you’re qualified. Certifications give you instant credibility.”
With certifications come confidence and respect.
When I go into a meeting, the people I speak with know I’m knowledgeable and skilled before a single word even leaves my mouth. And that matters to them. Most people have pressing issues, and they need them resolved quickly.
What advice would you give a friend pursuing Cisco certifications?
I would tell them not to hesitate. Certifications can have a profound impact on your role, your salary, and your self-esteem. Plus, they expand your talents. I may be a cybersecurity expert, but I also know a great deal about how networks function, and how you can make them perform better.

Now, with Cisco’s new certification paths, if you’re willing to put in the work, you can pursue just about any career interest at any level you want.
What would you tell your younger self?
“I would suggest reading more. I used to think self-help books were cheesy. Now I know better. You can always improve your knowledge, your technical skills, your management skills, and every other kind of skill. I would also recommend getting certified sooner, rather than later, so you’ll be ready for every opportunity that comes your way.”
