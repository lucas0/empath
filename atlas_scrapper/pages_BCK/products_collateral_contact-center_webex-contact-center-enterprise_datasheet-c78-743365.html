Table 1.           Core features
FEATURE
BENEFITS
Omnichannel: voice, email, and chat
Each agent license includes Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email (ECE), which offers multichannel capabilities with chat, email, and web callback.
●  This feature set helps businesses manage customer email messages and chats by automatically routing the chat or email to the correct resource, based upon information in the request and agent availability.
●  With chat collaboration, customers can chat with agents live over the web, with agents able to handle multiple chat sessions simultaneously.
●  The email feature helps businesses manage large volumes of customer email inquiries by sending automated replies and routing the email to the right resource.
●  With the web callback feature, customers can request a callback from a contact center when the right agent is available. ECE also provides reporting and monitoring tools to more effectively manage your contact center.
Automatic Call Distribution (ACD)
●  Webex CCE provides information routing services based on Cisco’s Unified Contact Center Enterprise (UCCE) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager (UCM) technology.
●  ACD functionality allows collection and routing of calls to a contact center agent; conversion of calls to formats that can be carried by a data network to their recipient; rules-based routing; multi-skilled expert agent selection; precision routing; supervisor features; call prompting; announcements; and music-on-hold and queuing capabilities.
●  Webex CCE includes precision routing, which sends the contact to the best available resource based on information about the caller and the attributes of the agent. By delivering the contact effectively, companies can reduce overall handling time, decrease the need for multiple transfers, and increase customer satisfaction with the experience. Precision routing is supported for all contact channels, including voice, video, web, chat, and email.
●  Webex CCE provides the option for callers to leave a voicemail if a desired agent is unavailable
Webex CCE also includes the following call distribution capabilities:
●  Computer Telephony Integration (CTI): Screen pops based on ANI or customer-entered information can be used to improve efficiency and customer satisfaction.
●  Queue enhancements: includes priority within queue, announcements/prompts within the queue, redirect on no answer.
Customer routing administration
Webex CCE provides the customer with a portal for configuring routing rules and scripts. This functionality includes:
●  Agent- and skill-based intelligent routing
●  Precision routing to enable routing based on multi-dimensional agent and customer-specific business logic
●  Adjusting real-time routing and call treatment
●  Setting schedules, enabling treatments and audit trails
●  Overflowing one skill group to another
●  Triggering messages on expected wait times
●  Controlling time-of-day routing and hours of operation schedules
●  Controlling special schedules that override and extend the normal schedule
Customer profile routing
●  Webex CCE extends the sources of data available for making contact routing decisions and for populating agent desktop applications. For instance, you can perform a lookup in your customer database during routing to guide its decisions. You can also use information from CRM applications to match customers with agents and expand the data available to screen-pop applications.
●  Wherever an agent is based, the system delivers context-call event and customer-profile data as a contact arrives, allowing the agent or application to personalize service and help maximize efficiency.
Self-service Interactive Voice Response (IVR)
Webex CCE provides self-service interactive voice response via Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal (Unified CVP).
●  With Unified CVP, you can pay a bill, order products and track delivery, locate a dealer, schedule a pickup, change name and address information, make travel arrangements, check payment status, receive notification of unusual activity, and request literature or product information.
●  Customers can use voice commands to retrieve the information they require without ever speaking with an agent, or to quickly navigate to the correct department or agent who can help them.
●  Unified CVP is designed to simplify business integration, increase flexibility, and provide efficiency gains. These features can reduce business costs and dramatically improve customer satisfaction.
Agent greeting
●  Play a configurable, automated agent greeting to callers, standardizing the caller experience. The greeting helps keep the agent voices fresh because they do not have to repeat the same greeting on every call.
Agent whisper
●  Play a configurable announcement to an agent right before the caller is connected, providing information about the type of call being delivered (for example, sales or technical support) and other guidance. Agents get information about the caller through their headset, speeding problem handling and improving first-call resolution.
Remote agent support
●  Remote agent support extends the contact center by providing Computer Telephony Integration (CTI), contact distribution, and reporting capabilities to remote agents in branch offices or at home, through either a broadband network connection or their home telephone line. Webex CCE provides identical user interfaces and feature functions to agents, regardless of location.
●  Cisco Unified Mobile Agent allows agents to choose their destination phone number during login time, and to change the number as often as they want, giving the contact center the flexibility to adapt to a fast-moving mobile workforce. With work-at-home programs, agents can be given location flexibility while reducing the contact center’s startup costs. This capability also allows agents to be on any phone device on any third-party switch infrastructure.
Team collaboration
●  Allows agents to collaborate with subject matter experts throughout the enterprise via messaging embedded within the agent desktop.
Cisco Outbound Option
●  The Cisco Outbound Option, with its combination of outbound dialing modes, complements the powerful inbound call-handling capability of Webex CCE.
●  Build campaigns to use predictive, progressive, or preview dialing, which are integrated with inbound calls and compliant with contact center service levels, to offer a powerful blended solution.
●  Allocate agents to handle only inbound, only outbound, or both inbound and outbound contacts, offering an effective way to increase resource use.
●  Call-Progress Analysis (CPA) (also known as answering machine detection) is enabled for the outbound dialer.
●  Outbound reports include performance monitoring counters and personal call-back improvements for better agent usage.
Agent and supervisor desktops
●  The Cisco Finesse ® desktop is a next-generation agent and supervisor desktop designed to provide easy access to the applications and information your customer service organization needs through a customizable web-based interface.
●  It offers contact center representatives an intuitive, easy-to-use desktop design to help improve their performance and satisfaction, in turn enhancing their ability to provide quality customer service.
●  For IT professionals, the Cisco Finesse application offers a thin-client agent desktop that integrates smoothly with the Webex Collaboration portfolio. It is standards-compliant and offers low cost of customization of agent and supervisor desktops.
Desktop features include:
●  User-configurable settings such as codes and speed dials
●  Direct reporting integration for select real-time reports
●  Screen pop service capabilities
●  Customized agent activity grids to separate inbound, outbound. and internal calls
●  Supervisor tools such as force logout, silent monitor, and real-time statistics
●  Integration to customer data via a published gadget integration methodology
Single sign-on
●  The solution simplifies login and password management for agents and supervisors by allowing just one login for the Cisco Finesse desktop and associated gadgets.
Supervisory features
●  Supervisors can view agent states and call information, send chat messages to agents, interrupt or intercept calls, record conversations, and silently monitor agent calls from the corporate network or through a remote dial-in connection. These features add value to the supervisor’s role in the contact center and help them effectively manage their teams.
●  With supervisor and agent chat capabilities, supervisors can send chat messages to agents participating in a call, allowing supervisors to coach agents unobtrusively on cross-sell and up-sell opportunities and help agents resolve customer situations. Supervisors can interrupt an agent’s call to create a three-way conference, and then interact with both the caller and the agent to help resolve a concern. A supervisor can remove the agent from a call using the Intercept feature, allowing the supervisor and caller to complete the call on their own while the agent handles another customer request.
●  Supervisors can change an agent’s state from their desktop. For example, agents may forget to make themselves available to take calls after a break or neglect to log out when away from their workstations for an extended period. Supervisors can easily log out missing agents or make unintentionally idle agents ready to take calls.
●  This function is critical to highly distributed contact center deployments.
●  Supervisors also can change an agent’s skill profile in real time. This capability gives supervisors tactical tools to manage their agent teams and support contact center management objectives.
Reporting and analytics
●  Reporting is provided by the Cisco Unified Intelligence Center (UIC), which offers numerous report templates intended to meet common reporting needs. With the availability of the underlying data model and schema, you can easily develop custom reports to extend the solution to meet specific reporting needs.
●  Allows for the export of reporting data to external data warehouse environments for extended storage and advanced analytics.
●  Provides real-time and historical data necessary for mission-critical contact center reporting across all media types. The solution provides accurate and timely reports on contact center activity, helping managers make informed decisions regarding staffing levels and contact handling procedures.
●  The Live Data feature provides a new real-time architecture with significant real-time refresh-rate improvements with actionable, real-time contact center information.
Administration and management portal
Streamlined administration allows managers to perform all contact center administration centrally. The administrative interface allows agents to be set up to handle voice, web, chat, and email contacts, depending on their assigned skill sets.
The interface allows system managers, administrators, and supervisors to develop, modify, or view routing scripts; manage the system configuration; monitor contact center performance; define and request reports; and help ensure system security. This one user interface provides enterprise-wide control across a single or multisite contact center.
Webex CCE’s web-based administration portal includes capabilities to:
●  Manage access and role-based permissions
●  Search for an agent team or skill group
●  Quickly add or remove agents to or from a skill or team
●  Create agents, change agent passwords, and disable agents
●  Bulk and clone agents
●  Create contact center users
●  Audit trail retention for six months
●  Administer Unified Communications (UC) phones and features
●  Customizable dashboards
●  Enable access to most functions via a mobile device (i.e., a smartphone or tablet if the device is connected to the customer’s network)
●  Create and publish audio files in real time
●  Automate distribution of audio files to media servers
●  Enable/disable pre-recorded audio prompts
●  Access restrictions
APIs
●  Cisco Finesse API allows companies to develop custom Cisco Finesse desktop capabilities tailored to meet the specific needs of their contact center operations through REST APIs and JavaScript libraries that simplify the development and integration of value-added applications and reduce the need for detailed desktop development expertise.
●  Agent request API enables businesses to add voice callback as a feature to their custom-developed applications for the web and for mobile applications. Businesses can present callback as one of the ways customers can contact them, allowing customers to choose the channel of communication that works best for them.
●  Outbound campaign management API allows for more precise control over contact center outbound calling campaigns.
●  Precision routing API enables an administrator to programmatically control their routing rules.
●  Unified Customer Voice Portal (Unified CVP) Call Studio integrations offer an IVR developer the ability to provide backend integrations to IVR applications, allowing personalization and integration with backend business systems.
●  Database lookup API/app gateway provides the ability to integrate business logic with agent routing algorithms.
●  Cisco Unified Intelligence Center (UIC) reporting API provides a systems analyst with the ability to create customized reports and dashboards.
