Webex best practices for secure meetings: Site Administration
Follow these best practices to help ensure security for your Webex meetings, trainings, and events.
Overview of Webex security
The Webex Meetings Suite helps enable global employees and virtual teams to meet and collaborate in real time as though they were working in the same room. Businesses, institutions, and government agencies worldwide rely on Webex. Webex helps to simplify business processes and improve results for sales, marketing, training, project management, and support teams.
For all organizations and their users, security is a fundamental concern. O|||ga7h8q.html<<<>>> their users, security is a fundamental concern. Online collaboration must provide multiple levels of security, from scheduling meetings to authenticating participants to sharing content.
Webex provides a secure environment that you can configure as an open place to collaborate. Understanding the security features as site administrators and end users can allow you to tailor your Webex site to your business needs.
For additional information, see the Webex security technical paper.
Best practices for Webex administrators
Effective security begins with Webex site administration; which allows administrators to manage and enforce security policies for host and presenter privileges. For example, a|||ga7h8q.html<<<>>> for host and presenter privileges. For example, an authorized administrator can customize session configurations to disable a presenter’s ability to share applications, or to transfer files on a per-site or a per-user basis.
We absolutely recommend that you keep your number of administrators to a minimum. Fewer administrators means fewer opportunities for site setting errors.
After you review the best practices for site administrators, be sure to review the best practices for secure meetings for hosts.
We recommend using the following features for protection of your meetings:
Use Scheduled Meetings for comprehensive security
All meetings: Lock meetings after a default time
All meetings: Use|||ga7h8q.html<<<>>>ck meetings after a default time
All meetings: Use the lobby to control meeting access for guest users
Scheduled meetings: Enforce meeting password when joining from phone or video conferencing systems

Scheduled meetings: Don't allow attendees to join before the meeting host



Personal Room Meetings: Use CAPTCHA for guests joining Personal Room Meetings
All meetings: Disable callback to certain countries

All meetings: Make all meetings unlisted
All meetings: Control content sharing and file transfer

Data retention changes coming in 2023
In 2023, we're changing the way we retain user-generated data in Webex. This announcement explains the changes and how to prepare for them.
About forthcoming data retention changes
Webex is removing the option to retain messaging data for an indefinite time period. At present, we do not have a default retention period. Which means that if you have not set a retention policy, Webex retains your user-generated content indefinitely.
This retention applies to new as well as historical data. For example, If the retention policy is set to 360 days and takes into effect from 31st Jan 2023, a me|||nvsge9y.html<<<>>>ays and takes into effect from 31st Jan 2023, a meeting recording generated on or before 5th Feb 2022, gets deleted. Similarly, with the retention period set to 360 days, a meeting recording generated on 1st October 2022 is deleted by 26 September 2023.
By introducing a default retention period, we're helping you manage the lifecycle of your user-generated content, reduce your data footprint, and ensure you can meet compliance and regulatory standards.
This change applies to user-generated content for all enterprise Webex customers.
This change does not affect you if you already defined a retention policy. Your retention period stays the same.

New UI changes

  We're progressively rolling out the new UI changes. This means that some organizations may still see the old UI and some may see the new UI in Control Hub.
1
Sign in to your organization in Control Hub at https:/|||nvsge9y.html<<<>>> in to your organization in Control Hub at https://admin.webex.com, and go to Organization Settings, and scroll to Retention.
2
Define a Webex Space Retention Policy by clicking Modify and then:
Choose the Default or a Custom retention period for 1-1 Chat.
Choose the Default or a Custom retention period for Group Chat.
Click Save.
The minimum values are 1 day, 1 month, or 1 year. The maximum values are 3600 days, 120 months, or 10 years. The values control how long Webex keeps user-generated messages, files, and whiteboards. You can set different or the same values for 1-1 and group chats, respectively.
3
Define a Webex Meetings Retention Policy by clicking Settings and then:
Under Retention|||nvsge9y.html<<<>>>icy by clicking Settings and then:
Under Retention Policy:
Choose the Default or a Custom retention period for meeting data.
The minimum value is 7 days, and the maximum value is 3600 days. The value controls how long Webex keeps recordings, transcripts, and highlights from your meetings.
Under Deleted recording:
Choose Purged within 30 days or Follow the retention policy as set above.
Click Save.
What you should do to prepare for this change
If you don't do anything, we set your retention period to the new default on the date given above.
If you don't want to keep user-generated data, or you don't care about how we handle this data, you don't need to do anything. We'll stop keeping the data|||nvsge9y.html<<<>>>t need to do anything. We'll stop keeping the data indefinitely; instead, we'll purge it after the new default retention period.
If you want to control your user-generated Webex content, these are your options:
Change your organization's retention period through Control Hub:

  The retention controls for messaging are not yet available in Control Hub unless you have Pro Pack. We intend to make the controls available for all enterprise cu|||nvsge9y.html<<<>>> make the controls available for all enterprise customers early in 2023.
Consider upgrading to Pro Pack if you want to retain data for longer than the new limits.

Manage tracking codes for Webex sites in Control Hub
Tracking codes help you understand how much a particular group within an organization is using Webex services. You can also map tracking codes to user attributes so that all Webex sites have consistent data.
Map tracking codes to user attributes

  The map tracking codes to user attributes feature is a draft that’s in public preview. We’re giving you a sneak peek at what to expect.
Although you can set up tracking codes by itself, we recommend that you map tracking codes to user attributes because this process:
Ensures consistency with user data in the organization. You can ma|||nlkiw8e.html<<<>>>ncy with user data in the organization. You can map tracking codes to the same user attributes in multiple sites so that any changes made to a user attribute will update tracking codes in all sites.
Allows you to use tracking codes for sites as needed.
Enables required tracking codes. Previously, required tracking codes weren't possible on Control Hub managed meeting sites. Mapping tracking codes to user attributes is also the only way to get the equivalent of required tracking codes on Control Hub sites.
Automatically populates tracking code data through a sync source if your organization uses automated user onboarding processes, such as Directory Connector, Azure AD, or SAML.
Learn more ab|||nlkiw8e.html<<<>>>ectory Connector, Azure AD, or SAML.
Learn more about how to map tracking codes to user attributes in this article.
Most of this document doesn't apply if your site has the mapped tracking codes to user attributes feature. If you want to manage tracking codes in bulk with a CSV file, you'll need to follow the steps for the user CSV file instead.
About Using Tracking Codes

  If you don't see tracking codes in Control Hub, contact Cisco support.
Tracking codes are alphanumeric codes that identify categories of users on a Webex site. With tracking codes, you can analyze usage by various groups within an organization—For example, by Department or Division. Tracking codes appear as part of the u|||nlkiw8e.html<<<>>>r Division. Tracking codes appear as part of the user information in usage reports, which you can obtain for your Webex site. You can use the data in these reports for cost accounting or other internal billing processes.
You can require that users do one or more of the following:
Provide a code value in their user profiles when they sign up for an account.
Provide a code value when scheduling an event, a meeting, or a session.
Select a code value from a list of values that you specify.
You can create a list of code values using one of the following methods:
Type the list of code values.
Import the list of code values from a comma-separated value (CSV) file that you create.
Alternatively, you|||nlkiw8e.html<<<>>>lue (CSV) file that you create.
Alternatively, you can specify code values in a user’s profile when you add or edit a user account in Control Hub. Thus, users need not type or select codes values for their profiles or when they schedule events, meetings, or sessions.

  If you completed the site linking procedure, then manage tracking codes for your site in Webex Site Administration.
Specify Tracking Codes for a User
You can also specify tracking codes to track an individual user's or a department's usage of a Webex site.

From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Users, and select the user to specify tracking codes for.

Select the Advanced User Settings and Tracking Codes link.

On the Advanced User Settings page, go to Tracking Codes, and specify the user's tracking codes, such as West for Region and Sales for Department.
6
Click Update, and then select OK.
Manage Tracking Codes in Bulk
You can manage multiple tracking code values for users by downloading and editing a CSV file in a CSV editor like Microsoft Excel, and then reimporting the file into Control Hub.

  For the upcoming map tracking codes to user attributes feature, this site CSV file wi|||nlkiw8e.html<<<>>> to user attributes feature, this site CSV file will only be read-only.

2
Choose the Webex site that you want to edit the tracking code values for, and under Licenses and Users, select Bulk Manage.

6
Go to Licenses and Users, and under Users, select Bulk Manage.
7
In the Bulk Modify User Attributes window, import the CSV file by clicking Import and selecting the file, or by dragging the file into the window.
Importing of Tracking Code Values
If you specified tracking code labels, you can import tracking code values instead of typing the values on the Tracking Codes List page. To use this process, first create a CSV (comma-separated values) file that contains the tracking code values.
This option is useful if your organization use|||nlkiw8e.html<<<>>>es.
This option is useful if your organization uses many tracking codes and you want to maintain a list outside of Control Hub.

  If you specify code values incorrectly, Control Hub cannot add those values to the list. In that case, a list of records is generated for the values that it couldn't add, including the cause for each error. You can download a file containing these records to your computer for reference or to correct the errors directly in that file.
You can correct errors directly in the file that is created for you. Ensure that you delete the last column, labeled Comments, before you upload the file to create the remaining code values.
After you upload a CSV file, you can edit v|||nlkiw8e.html<<<>>>alues.
After you upload a CSV file, you can edit values individually on the Tracking Codes List page. Or, you can contact your Webex account manager for assistance.
Specify Tracking Codes
Site administrators can specify tracking codes that track usage of your Webex site. For example, tracking codes can be specified Project, Division, and Department.
The specified tracking code labels, or group names, can appear on any of the following pages on a Webex site:
My Profile page: A page that contains personal information about each user who has an account. A user can maintain personal information on this page.

Manage tracking codes for Webex sites in Control Hub
Tracking codes help you understand how much a particular group within an organization is using Webex services. You can also map tracking codes to user attributes so that all Webex sites have consistent data.
Map tracking codes to user attributes

  The map tracking codes to user attributes feature is a draft that’s in public preview. We’re giving you a sneak peek at what to expect.
Although you can set up tracking codes by itself, we recommend that you map tracking codes to user attributes because this process:
Ensures consistency with user data in the organization. You can ma|||fs78p5.html<<<>>>ncy with user data in the organization. You can map tracking codes to the same user attributes in multiple sites so that any changes made to a user attribute will update tracking codes in all sites.
Allows you to use tracking codes for sites as needed.
Enables required tracking codes. Previously, required tracking codes weren't possible on Control Hub managed meeting sites. Mapping tracking codes to user attributes is also the only way to get the equivalent of required tracking codes on Control Hub sites.
Automatically populates tracking code data through a sync source if your organization uses automated user onboarding processes, such as Directory Connector, Azure AD, or SAML.
Learn more ab|||fs78p5.html<<<>>>ectory Connector, Azure AD, or SAML.
Learn more about how to map tracking codes to user attributes in this article.
Most of this document doesn't apply if your site has the mapped tracking codes to user attributes feature. If you want to manage tracking codes in bulk with a CSV file, you'll need to follow the steps for the user CSV file instead.
About Using Tracking Codes

  If you don't see tracking codes in Control Hub, contact Cisco support.
Tracking codes are alphanumeric codes that identify categories of users on a Webex site. With tracking codes, you can analyze usage by various groups within an organization—For example, by Department or Division. Tracking codes appear as part of the u|||fs78p5.html<<<>>>r Division. Tracking codes appear as part of the user information in usage reports, which you can obtain for your Webex site. You can use the data in these reports for cost accounting or other internal billing processes.
You can require that users do one or more of the following:
Provide a code value in their user profiles when they sign up for an account.
Provide a code value when scheduling an event, a meeting, or a session.
Select a code value from a list of values that you specify.
You can create a list of code values using one of the following methods:
Type the list of code values.
Import the list of code values from a comma-separated value (CSV) file that you create.
Alternatively, you|||fs78p5.html<<<>>>lue (CSV) file that you create.
Alternatively, you can specify code values in a user’s profile when you add or edit a user account in Control Hub. Thus, users need not type or select codes values for their profiles or when they schedule events, meetings, or sessions.

  If you completed the site linking procedure, then manage tracking codes for your site in Webex Site Administration.
Specify Tracking Codes for a User
You can also specify tracking codes to track an individual user's or a department's usage of a Webex site.
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Users, and select the user to specify tracking codes for.
2
In the panel that opens on the right, go to the Servi|||fs78p5.html<<<>>>the panel that opens on the right, go to the Services section, and select Meeting.

4
Select the Advanced User Settings and Tracking Codes link.
5
On the Advanced User Settings page, go to Tracking Codes, and specify the user's tracking codes, such as West for Region and Sales for Department.
6
Click Update, and then select OK.
Manage Tracking Codes in Bulk
You can manage multiple tracking code values for users by downloading and editing a CSV file in a CSV editor like Microsoft Excel, and then reimporting the file into Control Hub.

  For the upcoming map tracking codes to user attributes feature, this site CSV file wi|||fs78p5.html<<<>>> to user attributes feature, this site CSV file will only be read-only. If you want to manage tracking codes in bulk once this feature is released, you'll need to follow the steps for the user CSV file instead.
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Services and under Meeting, select Sites.
2
Choose the Webex site that you want to edit the tracking code values for, and under Licenses and Users, select Bulk Manage.
3
In the Bulk Modify User Attributes window, click Export to export a CSV file containing your user attributes that you can use to bulk manage tracking codes.
4
When the file is finished exporting, under Licenses and Users, select Export Results, and choose Down|||fs78p5.html<<<>>> and Users, select Export Results, and choose Download.
5
Open the file in a CSV editor, manage the tracking codes for your users, and then save the CSV file.
6
Go to Licenses and Users, and under Users, select Bulk Manage.
7
In the Bulk Modify User Attributes window, import the CSV file by clicking Import and selecting the file, or by dragging the file into the window.
Importing of Tracking Code Values
If you specified tracking code labels, you can import tracking code values instead of typing the values on the Tracking Codes List page. To use this process, first create a CSV (comma-separated values) file that contains the tracking code values.
This option is useful if your organization use|||fs78p5.html<<<>>>es.
This option is useful if your organization uses many tracking codes and you want to maintain a list outside of Control Hub.

  If you specify code values incorrectly, Control Hub cannot add those values to the list. In that case, a list of records is generated for the values that it couldn't add, including the cause for each error. You can download a file containing these records to your computer for reference or to correct the errors directly in that file.
You can correct errors directly in the file that is created for you. Ensure that you delete the last column, labeled Comments, before you upload the file to create the remaining code values.
After you upload a CSV file, you can edit v|||fs78p5.html<<<>>>alues.
After you upload a CSV file, you can edit values individually on the Tracking Codes List page. Or, you can contact your Webex account manager for assistance.
Specify Tracking Codes
Site administrators can specify tracking codes that track usage of your Webex site. For example, tracking codes can be specified Project, Division, and Department.
The specified tracking code labels, or group names, can appear on any of the following pages on a Webex site:
My Profile page: A page that contains personal information about each user who has an account. A user can maintain personal information on this page.
Schedule a Meeting page: (Webex Meetings) The pages on which users provide information w|||fs78p5.html<<<>>>gs) The pages on which users provide information when scheduling a meeting.

Differences between Control Hub and Site Administration-managed Webex sites
Learn about the differences between managing a Webex site in Control Hub and Site Administration.
Control Hub-managed Webex sites
Control Hub is the administrative portal for all of Cisco's cloud collaboration products. You can manage every Webex service in one location. The benefits of managing sites in Control Hub include:
Unified license assignments across all Webex services.
Consistent security policies across all Webex services.
Common sign-in experience for all end users between different Webex services.

Site Administration-managed Webex sites
Site Administration is an administrative portal for only the Webex Meetings Suite. If your organization decides to add more products, such as the Webex App or Webex Calling, you'd have to manage those products in Control Hub while still using Site Administration to manage Webex Meetings.

  If you initially chose Site Administration and want to switch over to Control Hub, you can convert to Control Hub at any time.

All sites share the same SSO configurations and identity provider (IdP). You can either have the same SSO for all sites, or no SSO at all.
If the Control Hub-managed organization is configured with SSO, then linked Site Administration sites with a different IdP than the organization will use the same IdP as the one in Control Hub (the previous IdP used in Site Administration won't apply anymore).

All sites share the same SSO configurations and identity provider (IdP). You can either have the same SSO for all sites, or no SSO at all.
If the Control Hub-managed organization is configured with SSO, then linked Site Administration sites with a different IdP than the organization will use the same IdP as the one in Control Hub (the previous IdP used in Site Administration won't apply anymore).
Site Administration sites without SSO configured will have SSO enabled and will use the same IdP as the organization after being updated to Control Hub.
Each site can be set u|||nceb8tm.html<<<>>>ing updated to Control Hub.
Each site can be set up with different SSO configurations and IdPs. A site can also have no SSO, even if the linked Control Hub-managed organization is using SSO.
SSO authentication for attendees
This feature is not available at this time for Control Hub-managed sites.
In the future, administrators will be able to configure Control Hub to require sign-in for all participants whose email addresses match domains claimed by the organization.
This will also apply to non-SSO organizations.
Administrators can require SSO authentication for attendees for participants whose email addresses match specific domains.

  This requirement only applies to meetings on that site.

  ** API integrations for Site Administration-managed Webex sites may need to be modified in order to work in Control Hub-managed Webex sites if you update to Control Hub at a later date.
It is recommended that API integrations be tested thoroughly to make sure all features are working after Webex sites are updated from Site Administration to Control Hub.
Differences between password management features in Control Hub and Site Administration

Admin control to initialize or reset password, force change of passwords, or dealing with forgotten passwords. Password is directly controlled between users and Webex Identity (or SSO).
Admin handling of user forgot password requests Not supported. A planned feature is allowing admins to require users to change their passwords.
Users can configure a password per site. User passwords are configured with Webex Identity. The same passwords are applicable across all Webex sites and services.
User profile values

Some values, such as address, aren’t synched yet from Webex identity to Meetings sites. These values will be synched to Webex identity in the future.
Site Administration
User profile values are configured per site, so the same user can have different values across multiple sites.
Customized email templates
Some of the email templates in Site Administration aren’t applicable to Control Hub, so customization for those email templates isn't applicable in Control Hub-managed sites. For example, welcome emails are controlled through user licensing and admins aren't involved in user passwo|||nceb8tm.html<<<>>>icensing and admins aren't involved in user password management.

Differences between Control Hub and Site Administration-managed Webex sites
Learn about the differences between managing a Webex site in Control Hub and Site Administration.
Control Hub-managed Webex sites
Control Hub is the administrative portal for all of Cisco's cloud collaboration products. You can manage every Webex service in one location. The benefits of managing sites in Control Hub include:
Unified license assignments across all Webex services.
Consistent security policies across all Webex services.
Common sign-in experience for all end users between different Webex services.
Modern administrator controls, such as Dire|||nsjpi6h.html<<<>>>vices.
Modern administrator controls, such as Directory Connector, SCIM, and Active Directory groups.
License templates to assign multiple licenses to users automatically.
Site Administration-managed Webex sites
Site Administration is an administrative portal for only the Webex Meetings Suite. If your organization decides to add more products, such as the Webex App or Webex Calling, you'd have to manage those products in Control Hub while still using Site Administration to manage Webex Meetings.

  If you initially chose Site Administration and want to switch over to Control Hub, you can convert to Control Hub at any time.

User management
Users are managed centrally in Control Hub, including assigning licenses and configuring service levels.
Webex Meetings users and settings are managed in Site Administration. If you have other Webex products, such as Webex App, you have to manage the users and settings for that product in Control Hub.
Users will use the same credentials to sign in to both Webex App and Webex Meetings.

Users must be in the Control Hub organization to be assigned a host or attendee lic|||nsjpi6h.html<<<>>>organization to be assigned a host or attendee license in Webex Meetings.
A host on a Webex site can belong to any company or organization.
Multiple Webex sites
All Webex sites in Control Hub share common settings, such as user creation and how users authenticate to Webex.
Users can only have one password across all Webex services. The same user can't have different passwords on different Webex sites.
If an organization is configured for SSO, then all Control Hub-managed Webex sites in the same organization follow the same SSO.
Each Webex site is autonomous, and the same user can have different email addresses and passwords across different Webex sites.

A company with multiple Webex sites can choose the Webex sites on which to enable or disable SSO.
APIs** and integrations
Control Hub also uses People REST APIs for user management, such as creating or licensing users.
Webex XML APIs are forward- compatible with Control Hub- managed sites for user management. Modifications are generally unnecessary for most integrations after the site updates to Control Hub. For more information, see Cisco Webex Meetings API Updates Overview (API 41).
API integrations can be built entirely with Webex XML APIs.

Webex App | Secure mobile devices
We provide several options for IT administrators to secure the Webex App app on users mobile devices. This includes Microsoft Intune SDK, EMM with AppConfig, app wrapping using the iOS IPA files and the Android AAB files, and admin controls for mobile management.
As an IT administrator, you can enforce complete control by enrolling the device with Microsoft Intune or another third party service for device enrollment, or use Control Hub to configure settings that enforce pin lock or control the data sharing between the users within your organization.

ThousandEyes endpoint agents for Troubleshooting in Control Hub
You can integrate ThousandEyes with Troubleshooting in Control Hub so you can see full path visibility of users across the network to isolate issues with greater clarity. When a user with a ThousandEyes endpoint agent installed on their machine joins a meeting through the Webex App, a Network Path line will be visible under Audio Quality in their participant details page. This line indicates the network path quality of audio data between the user’s client and the audio media node.

Configure The Webex App's Default Landing Screen
In this article
About the Webex App Default Landing Screen
The "Landing Screen" refers to the main window of the Webex app, and it can show any of the following:
Messaging
Contacts
Calling
Meetings
Users may not be able to see the default tab
The Webex app does not expose services for which the user is not licensed, so it's possible that the default landing screen you select is not visible to some of your users.
In this case, the affected users land on the screen that shows the highest placed service that they are licensed for (the order is the same as the above list). For example|||67fcc1.html<<<>>> order is the same as the above list). For example, if you select Meetings as the default landing screen, users who are not licensed for meetings see the messaging screen when they open the Webex app.
Changes take time to propagate
When you change these settings, you may wait up to eight hours for the change to apply to all users. In practice it is not usually this long.
The app remembers the user's choice
The user only needs to set the landing screen when they want to change it. The app remembers the choice.
If you subsequently prevent users from changing their default landing screen, the app will take your choice from Control Hub instead. If you change it again to allow the user to choose,|||67fcc1.html<<<>>>f you change it again to allow the user to choose, the app remembers what they chose before.

Slido FAQ
Slido is an easy to use audience engagement tool. It helps people to get the most out of meetings by bridging the gap between speakers and their audiences.
When Slido is integrated into your Control Hub organization, your users can add the Slido app to their meetings in Webex App. This integration brings additional Q&A and polling functionality to the meeting.
As an administrator for your Webex organization, you can enable Slido i|||nv2hm53.html<<<>>>or your Webex organization, you can enable Slido in Control Hub.
This action automatically creates a Slido organization for you, and you become the owner.

Manage your domains
Some Control Hub features require proof of domain ownership. Others use domains to ensure the security and integrity of your organization. You can use domains to help with user management. This article describes how to add, verify, claim, release, or remove domains when you don't need them any more.
You can drill down into meetings or calls per participant, and see detailed information about their audio, video, and sharing quality. Data is updated every minute for Webex Meetings and Call on Webex, so you can diagnose problems as they arise. Data for Webex Calling is updated at the end of each call.

Verify domains
Verify your domains to prove to Webex that you own them. Verifying domains allows you to claim users into your organization if they signed up into a different organization. You also must verify your domains before you can claim them.
To verify domains, we provide a token to add to your domain host's DNS TXT record. To confirm that you own the domain, we check for this token on the DNS server.
Claim domains
Claim a domain to associate that domain to automatically be created within your organization. Users who sign themselves up for Webex are also associate with this domain.

Users who exist in the free consumer organization are not automatically converted to your organization. You must convert these users. We recommend that you convert consumer users to your organization before claiming the domain.

Webex Meetings Suite System Requirements
Here's what you need to know about the requirements to join and host meetings. We've put together information about minimum browser and OS requirements, supported email applications, and supported languages.
Operating system and browser support for the Webex Meetings Suite
Supported operating systems
Windows
Windows Server 2008 64-bit
Windows Server 2008 R2 64-bit
Windows 10
Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB
Windows 11
Notes:
Windows OS support on Microsoft Surface Pro is supported.

Webex Meetings supports Windows Server 2012 R2 and 2016 with limitation that, for Webex meetings, Productivity Tools, and the desktop application, if a user doesn't have administrator privileges, then an administrator is required to install the Webex Meetings applications and Productivity Tools.
Mac OS X
10.13
10.14
10.15
11.0 (Big Sur)
12.0 (Monterey)

  FedRAMP-compliant Webex Meetings sites require Mac OS 10.13 or later.
Starting with Mac OS X 10.7, Apple no longer offers Java as part of the Mac operating system. Since Webex Meetings previously relied on the Java browser plugin to download the meeting|||nmrk74x.html<<<>>>on the Java browser plugin to download the meeting application for first-time users, users without Java installed found it difficult to join a meeting. The dependency on Java was removed. Instead, the user is asked to install a small plugin that, once installed, handles the rest of the meeting application installation and then starts the meeting.
When you start or join an event using Events (classic) for the first time on Safari 6.X and Safari 7, a problem occurs. After you have installed Webex, Safari requires you to trust the plugin for the site you’re attempting to join or start the event from. The page will refresh after that, but you’ll not join the event. In order to join, go back to t|||nmrk74x.html<<<>>>not join the event.

To verify domains, we provide a token to add to your domain host's DNS TXT record. To confirm that you own the domain, we check for this token on the DNS server.

Assign cohosts in meetings and webinars
The cohost role provides privileges similar to the host role, including starting the meeting or webinar in their place if they’re running late or can’t attend, and can help improve productivity.
Your site administrator must enable the feature for a host to designate cohosts in a meeting or webinar. For more information, contact your site administrator.
Cohosts
If the host is running late or can't attend, a cohost can start and manage the meeting or webinar in their place. Cohosts can also assist the host with meeting management, which is useful for larger meetings. If the host isn’|||nq4juobb.html<<<>>>ch is useful for larger meetings. If the host isn’t in the meeting, a cohost assumes the host role until the original host joins. Webex verifies whether or not someone who joins the meeting has a host account on the same Webex site as the meeting host before making them a cohost.
When scheduling a meeting or webinar, hosts can assign the cohost role to one or more attendees, and those invitees join the meeting as a cohost. The host can also assign the cohost role during a meeting or webinar, including guest attendees. The option to assign the role appears dimmed for attendees who join from unsupported clients.

Cohosts can perform the following tasks:
From the meeting or webinar information page:
Customize the registration form
Approve or reject pending registrants
Change a registrant's approval status
Invite or import panelists (webinar only)
Invite or import attendees
During the meeting or webinar:

Claim users to your organization ("convert" users)
If people used an email domain that you own to sign up for a personal Webex account or belong to other Control Hub organizations, you may be able to claim them into your organization. Individuals can choose to keep their personal accounts by using a different email address for your site.

  *See Step 4 for more information about the delayed claim option.

We highly recommend that you claim users before updating your site from Site Admin to Control Hub. If you claim users into your organization after the site has been|||ndl247o.html<<<>>>ers into your organization after the site has been updated to Control Hub, then those users can lose access to meetings and meeting assets in the site.
As a workaround, you can do the following to make sure that users won't lose access to meetings and meeting assets in the site after the site has been updated to Control Hub:
For users with external admin privileges to the organization or site—Remove all external admin access to the organization and site, and then remove the meeting site license. After you claim the user, re-license that user to the site. You can also restore their external admin privileges.
For regular users—Remove the meeting site license, claim the user to your organizatio|||ndl247o.html<<<>>>g site license, claim the user to your organization, and then re-license that user to the site.
Read this before you try to claim users:
Disable directory synchronization in the Directory Connector before claiming users.
If you run a synchronization and the claimed users are not in your directory, the synchronization process could delete the claimed users. We recommend that you test with a dry-run synchronization after you claim users.
Verify your domains in Control Hub, so you can claim any users whose accounts use those domains in their email addresses.

Legal Notice about pronouns in Webex
Cisco’s purpose is to Power an Inclusive Future for All. When we say "all," we mean everyone, including communities across all gender identities. At the same time, we recognize that for some of our users, it may not be or feel safe to share your pronouns. Sharing your pronouns in Webex is entirely voluntary – if you choose to make your pronouns visible, you can change the visibility to the default setting "hidden" at any time. If you feel unsafe sharing this information, we suggest you do not select or input your pronouns and leave the setting as "hidd|||nwf3ypb.html<<<>>>input your pronouns and leave the setting as "hidden." If you choose to use the pronouns feature in Webex, your personal pronouns will be visible in (i) your contact card, (ii) headers in direct message spaces, (iii) your contacts profile, (iv) your profile menu, and (v) People Insights.
If you are a free user of the Webex App, you acknowledge and consent that by setting your pronoun visibility to "Everyone," Webex App users and participants in any Webex Meetings or Webinars will be able to see your personal pronouns in the areas listed above.
If you are an enterprise user, you acknowledge and consent that by setting your pronouns visibility to "People in my organization," your personal pron|||nwf3ypb.html<<<>>>to "People in my organization," your personal pronouns will be visible to all users in your organization in the areas listed above.
Please note that any changes to the visibility status of pronouns will not apply retroactively. For example, if your pronouns status was set to "Visible" and you attended a Webex Meeting that was recorded, a subsequent change to your pronouns visibility to "Hidden" will not remove the pronouns that were visible in the previous Webex Meeting recording.|||nwf3ypb.html<<<>>>April 26, 2023 |

The Dedicated Instance service is primarily delivered over a private connection to the customer premises. This document details the Partner Connect option for customers to use with Webex to extend their organization to Webex Calling – Dedicated Instance.

Before you submit the peering request for Partner Connect, make sure the Dedicated Instance service is activated in that respective region.
Partner Connect
The Partner Connect model lets partners aggregate all the customer networks and extend the connectivity to their Webex Calling Dedicated Instance.

Management Applications access to their customer apps, for example, Domain Managers
Partner's Customer Aggregation Framemwork
Aggregate customer networks and extend their connection to their respective Dedicated Instance

Feature access codes for Webex Calling
Feature access codes (FACs), also known as star codes, give you access to advanced calling features. Your Webex App and your IP phone support FACs.
For some of the features below, you need to get a dial tone before entering the code. For example, if you're on a call that you want to park, place the call on hold, get a dial tone, and then enter *68. You can then enter the extension at which you want to park the call or # to park the call on your own extension.

The codes below aren't designed to work with Webex Meetings. See Use DTMF commands in your Personal Room Meetings for DTMF keys |||heauzeb.html<<<>>>ands in your Personal Room Meetings for DTMF keys you can use with Meetings.

Configure emergency call notifications in Control Hub
In this article
In order to comply with Public Law 115-127, also known as Kari’s Law, any call that's made from within your organization to emergency services must generate an email notification. You can enable or disable email emergency call notifications across all locations or allow selected locations to be enabled.
Emergency call notification details
When an emergency call is made, an email notification is sent to the specified email address. Make sure your users are aware of this behavior before you turn this feature on. The notification includes:
Date and start time of|||n6x6b78.html<<<>>> The notification includes:

Dialed number
User’s ID, first and last name
User’s extension (if assigned)
User’s phone number (if assigned)—The user’s assigned phone number and may not correspond to the phone number set as the caller ID and passed as a callback number to emergency services. If the caller is extension only, only the extension is provided in the notification.
Location ID and name—The information about the location the user is assigned to.
Location address—The main address defined for the location the user is assigned to. This location may not correspond to the physical location where the emergency call was placed.
The email generated is |||n6x6b78.html<<<>>>emergency call was placed.
The email generated is available in English only. Translation of the Emergency Call Notification email is not currently supported.

Block Internal Communication in Webex App Spaces for Your Organization
With the extended security pack, you can create a policy in Control Hub to prevent users in specific Active Directory (AD) groups from communicating with each other using messaging in Webex App.
You must use Active Directory and sync your users and groups to Webex with Directory Connector.

  User membership in BIC policy groups must be unique. Users can't be members of multiple groups when you configure these policies.
Add policies to block internal communication
1
Sign in to Control Hub at https://admin.webex.com, go to Organization Settings and scroll t|||6kmeef.html<<<>>>ebex.com, go to Organization Settings and scroll to Internal Communication.
2
Toggle the Allow Internal Communication setting to on. By default, it is enabled.
3
Click Modify and create up to five policies.
4
Enter an Active Directory group in the Primary Group field and enter up to 5 groups in the Policy Group field, to block communication between those groups.
5
Click Save Policy.
People in these groups can't invite each other to spaces or start conversations with each other. However, they can still communicate with other people in the organization.
Policy enforcement
Policy enforcement typically involves removing violating users in group spaces and putting 1:1 spaces into read-only mode.
|||6kmeef.html<<<>>>paces and putting 1:1 spaces into read-only mode.
Once the new BIC policy is set up, enforcement occurs in the following scenarios:
Proactive policy enforcement occurs when users are added to existing or new spaces.
Retroactive policy enforcement will occur in existing 1:1 and group spaces when users change AD groups (typically due to a job change).

  Customers who have already enabled BIC policies will need to delete the existing policies and re-add them within Control Hub to trigger retroactive policy enforcement on existing space violations.

Manage hunt groups in Control Hub
In this article
You can use hunt groups to ensure that all of your incoming calls are answered by the right people or routed to voicemail for later response. Hunt groups route incoming calls to specific employees in a predetermined pattern. This is done by assigning a phone number to a group of employees and then setting rules that define how the call is answered, how long the call remains on hold, and who to forward the call to.
Create a hunt group
Before you begin
You may want to set up hunt groups in the following scenarios:
A Sales team that wants sequential routing. An incoming call ring|||q7vr6m.html<<<>>>at wants sequential routing. An incoming call rings one phone, but if there's no answer, the call goes to the next hunt group member in the list.
A Support team that wants phones to ring all at once so that the first available member can take the call.

In the Call Routing tab, choose one of the following options:
Circular (Max 1,000 agents)—This option cycles through all members after the last member that took a call. It sends calls to the next available hunt group |||q7vr6m.html<<<>>>. It sends calls to the next available hunt group member.
Top Down (Max 1,000 agents)—Send the call through the queue of members in order, starting from the top each time.
Longest Idle (Max 1,000 agents)—Sends calls to the member that has been idle the longest. If they don't answer, proceed to the next member who has been idle second longest, and so on until the call is answered.
Weighted (Max 100 agents)—Sends call to idle members based on percentages you assign to each member of the hunt group (up to 100%).
Simultaneous (Max 50 agents)—Sends calls to all members in a call queue at once.

Forward after a set number of rings—Unanswered calls after a defined number of rings forwards to a designated number.
Divert calls when unreachable—Unanswered calls divert to a defined phone number. This could |||q7vr6m.html<<<>>>alls divert to a defined phone number.

Manage hunt groups in Control Hub
In this article
You can use hunt groups to ensure that all of your incoming calls are answered by the right people or routed to voicemail for later response. Hunt groups route incoming calls to specific employees in a predetermined pattern. This is done by assigning a phone number to a group of employees and then setting rules that define how the call is answered, how long the call remains on hold, and who to forward the call to.
Create a hunt group
Before you begin
You may want to set up hunt groups in the following scenarios:
A Sales team that wants sequential routing. An incoming call ring|||p3zicc.html<<<>>>at wants sequential routing. An incoming call rings one phone, but if there's no answer, the call goes to the next hunt group member in the list.
A Support team that wants phones to ring all at once so that the first available member can take the call.

Sign up for face recognition and name labels
Make it easier for people in your organization to become familiar with each other. By using face recognition and name labels during meetings, you can match names with faces and help everyone connect.
During a meeting, face recognition technology is used to generate name labels. The way these labels are displayed depends on the device they are sent from. If you're using a personal device, only you will see your own name label. From shared devices:
Desk, Desk Pro, Desk Mini, and Room Kit Mini: Name labels for up to 4 people at a time are visible on the far-end throughout the meeting.

When you’re in a call or a meeting on a Board, Desk, or Room Series device that is Webex registered, your name label is visible for the receiving end. You can see the name labels of those who have signed up if you’re calling from a Board, Desk, SX, MX, or Room Series device that is Webex registered. DX70 and DX80 can only receive name labels.

Once you set up the site URL, you can start assigning basic meetings to your users so they can see what Webex Meetings is like.

  Sites with only Basic Meetings can't be deleted. You can set up a license template if you want to manage access on who receives a Basic Meetings license.

Known Issues and Limitations for Webex Calling Dedicated Instance Directory Service Synchronization
If you're exper|||718tob.html<<<>>> Directory Service Synchronization
If you're experiencing an issue with this feature, check to see if it's something that we already know about and have a recommended workaround.
Webex Calling Dedicated Instance Directory Service provisioning does not work with LDAP authentication as only the user data is synchronized and not the passwords for the Unified CM server and hence LDAP authentication doesn’t work.
Workaround: Single sign-on (SSO) must be used for logins. This document only covers single sign-on (SSO) integration.
Configure single sign-on (SSO) if you want your users to authenticate through their enterprise identity provider. See Single Sign-On Integration in Control Hub and SAML-B|||718tob.html<<<>>>ngle Sign-On Integration in Control Hub and SAML-Based SSO Solution for more infromation.
Contact Cisco TAC support to disable the Directory Service. Wait for a minute and then start setup of Directory Service again.
After deletion, in case you want to onboard the same Unified CM cluster to the organization again, you must first disable the Directory Service and then re-provision the same cluster.

Contact Cisco TAC support to disable the Directory Service.
In the synchronization agreement page, the Perform a sync every and Next re-sync time fields appear active. But these fields are grayed out in the Unified CM server when the Perform sync just once option is enabled. Currently, this is a l|||718tob.html<<<>>>ust once option is enabled. Currently, this is a limitation in the Webex Calling Dedicated Instance Directory Service provisioning feature which will be fixed in the upcoming release.
Users deleted in the Azure portal becomes inactive in Webex Identity Service but appears to be active in Unified CM.
Workaround: Go to Management > Users and delete the user from Control Hub. The user will be marked Inactive in Unified CM.
When provisioning new clusters for larger organizations (having more than 80,000 users), you will experience time-out currently. This issue will be resolved soon.
During provisioning, when you click the Abandon, Continue, and Enable Synchronization buttons on the Enable Synch|||718tob.html<<<>>>Enable Synchronization buttons on the Enable Synchronization page, status of the cluster does not change immediately in the user interface. This limitation is misleading since the actions take place in the backend.
Workaround: Avoid clicking the buttons twice and check the cluster status after few seconds. You will see that the cluster status changes from Action Required to Processing. This issue will be addressed soon.
Currently, the Enable Synchronization functionality hangs when the Unified Communications Manager network is down.

Migrate Your Phone to Webex Calling
In this article
Device Firmware Migration Overview
Perform the new and automated device firmware migration from Control Hub, so that you can migrate your enterprise devices to cloud. You can migrate the required Enterprise Firmware phones to Multiplatform Phone (MPP) Firmware from Control Hub. MPP phones are powered by Webex Calling solutions.
MPP firmware can run on certain models of the Cisco IP Phone 6800, 7800, and 8800 series. However, only the Cisco IP Phone 7800 and 8800 series have the capability to run either MPP firmware or Enterprise firmware. If you have the appropriate license,|||a5ormz.html<<<>>>ise firmware. If you have the appropriate license, you can migrate between the MPP or Enterprise firmware on the Cisco IP Phone 7800 and 8800 series.

7800 firmware migration requires that the 7800 model is the correct hardware version.
This feature helps to migrate the registration of a phone from one of the following devices to Webex Calling:
Unified CM with on-premises calling
Unified CM with hosted calling using Hosted Collaboration Solution.
Cloud calling via Spark Calling

Webex Calling media optimization with Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)
Webex Calling media optimization ensures the best calling experience where possible. The media path is optimized between supported devices using Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE). Media optimization allows devices to send media directly to one another, which reduces latency and bandwidth usage.
Prerequisites and limitations
Media optimization is supported across desk phones (excluding DECT & ATA devices), Webex, and the Local Gateway solution. When you make calls within your organization, between supported devices, the media for your c|||features-by-station_.html<<<>>>n, between supported devices, the media for your call flows directly between the devices whenever possible. This provides lower latency and better quality.

Please see What's New in Webex Calling for global enablement dates.
By default, media optimization is enabled on the desk phone devices and Webex and, usually, doesn’t require specified configuration.
For Local Gateway, media optimization can be enabled with the command STUN usage lite, which is reviewed in Register Local Gateway to Webex Calling

STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) is a standardized set of methods, including a network protocol, for traversal of network address translator gateways in applications of real-time voic|||features-by-station_.html<<<>>>nslator gateways in applications of real-time voice, video, messaging, and other interactive communications.
The Local Gateway (CUBE) supports ICE-lite. There are several restrictions to ICE support on the CUBE, including ICE-lite is not supported with SIP-TDM gateways. Please see details about ICE-lite support on CUBE.
Media optimization support on Local Gateway requires a minimum CUBE software version of 17.3 or 16.12.5.
Media optimization with a Local Gateway requires network reachability between the device and the Local Gateway. This can be achieved by either:
Assigning a public IP address to the Local Gateway.
Ensuring that the Local Gateway host address is accessible to a device within|||features-by-station_.html<<<>>>eway host address is accessible to a device within the same network as the Local Gateway.
In order to route calls, signaling data is sent to the Webex Calling cloud. An active internet connection is always required to make Webex Calling calls. However, media makes up the majority of traffic for a call.
Calls can only be optimized within a single organization. For interorganization calls, media must flow via the PSTN for regulatory reasons.
If Call Recording is enabled, media for recorded calls is routed to the cloud and are not optimized.

ICE (Media optimization) and Call Recording are both features that independently introduce a small audio delay at the beginning of the call and when used |||features-by-station_.html<<<>>> delay at the beginning of the call and when used together the audio delay is slightly longer and more noticeable to customers.
Phases of Webex Calling media optimization
Media optimization uses Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) to discover optimized media paths.
This happens in the following phases:
Candidate discovery
When a call is made, an endpoint must first discover a list of addresses where it can receive media. These addresses, or candidates, include an endpoint’s local address, and a server reflexive address that can be used to contact the endpoint through a NAT. The server reflexive address is determined by querying a STUN server in the Webex Calling cloud.
Candidate exc|||features-by-station_.html<<<>>>N server in the Webex Calling cloud.
Candidate exchange
In this phase, endpoints exchange the list of candidate addresses that are collected in Candidate discovery using SIP.
Connectivity checks
Endpoints test the candidate addresses exchanged in Candidate exchange to determine the best media path between two devices.
Media path optimization
Using a re-invite, the endpoints now begin to send media through the optimized path.
Analytics for media optimization
Data for optimized calls is available through the Media Quality analytics page or alternatively through the Troubleshooting tool within the Control Hub.|||features-by-station_.html<<<>>>August 02, 2023 |

Configure and manage voicemail settings for a Webex Calling user
In this article
Enable a user's voicemail and voicemail settings in Control Hub by giving them the ability to send calls to voicemail when they're busy or can't get to the phone, to enable voicemail notifications via email or text, or store voice messages in a preferred location.
Configure organizational settings for voicemail
Before you begin managing users’ voicemail settings, you must first configure your organizational settings. These configurations determine the users’ voicemail settings that you can set.
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, s|||calling-admin-portal-user-information_.html<<<>>>om the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, select Calling under Services.
Select Service Settings and locate the voicemail panel.

Setting up the extension on the voice portal is a prerequisite to configure voicemails. See Configure voice portals for Webex Calling in Control Hub for details.
You can configure the following:
Voicemail forwarding
When enabled, the settings allow users to forward a voicemail message to another users’ number or extension. If disabled, this prohibits the user to forward voicemail messages, using an external mailbox, or sending a copy of the voicemail message to a specified email address.
To enable this setting, click the toggle.
Voicemail deletion

Voicemai|||calling-admin-portal-user-information_.html<<<>>>ng, click the toggle.
Voicemail deletion

Voicemails over 180 days old are archived automatically. If you require access to archived voicemails, you are requested to raise a service request with Cisco.
Voicemail deletion allows you to set conditions for expired messages. When enabled, admins can specify the timeframe when messages expire. You can enter the days (1-180) in the provided field. Admins can also set conditions for message deletion.
You can enable the following:
Permissive Deletion—This keeps all unread voicemail messages and deletes those voicemail messages that have expired when a user accesses their mailbox.
Strict Deletion—This deletes all read and unread voicemail messages ba|||calling-admin-portal-user-information_.html<<<>>> deletes all read and unread voicemail messages based on the time frame you set.
To enable this setting, click the toggle and choose the appropriate configuration.
Voicemail passcode
When enabled, the settings allow you to create a time frame in which a person has to change their passcode and how often they can change their passcode again (once it’s changed):
You can set the minimum number of days (1–7) when a passcode can be changed by the user when enabled. When the toggle is off, they can change their passcode multiple times on the same day.

Webex Calling prevents the user from setting one of the older passcodes making the users' passcode more secure
You can set the number of days in whi|||calling-admin-portal-user-information_.html<<<>>> more secure
You can set the number of days in which a passcode expires (between 15 and 180) when enabled. When the toggle is off, the passcode never expires.

This feature also extends the passcode history 10–24. That is, it can store each user’s last 24 passcodes and prevent the user from reusing one of those stored passcodes.
To enable this setting, click the toggle and set the appropriate configurations.
Enable voicemail for a user
If you have call forwarding enabled, then those call forward settings override the voicemail settings you configured.

Public spaces in Webex
All about public spaces in Webex, and how to enable them for your organization.
About public spaces
Public spaces are group chats that are public for your organization's users. They are on by default, which means your organization's users can make spaces public, and your organization's users can find and join those spaces (without being explicitly added by a member or moderator).
Who controls public spaces?
As an organization administrator, you can turn this capability on or off for all users.
Any user in your organization can make a new space public.
All users in your organization can find all public |||r78evy.html<<<>>>ll users in your organization can find all public spaces.
Any user in your organization can join any public space in your organization.
Any user in your organization can make a public space private.
External users may be participating in your organization's spaces. They can't create, find, or join public spaces in your organization. Those spaces are public to your organization's users.
What happens if I change the public spaces setting?
If you disable this feature:
Webex immediately prevents your users from creating and joining public spaces.
The Webex App removes the controls for creating and finding public spaces.

  The Webex App takes up to 24 hours to refresh, so there is a period when |||r78evy.html<<<>>>to 24 hours to refresh, so there is a period when users may still see controls for public spaces, but the controls won't work. Restarting the Webex App clears those controls.
If you disable the feature when there are already public spaces:
Spaces that were public are no longer discoverable. Webex still displays the public label, but they behave the same way as private spaces.
Membership of public spaces does not automatically change.
The controls for adding and removing members to these spaces revert to the way they behave for private spaces in your organization.
If you re-enable the public spaces feature:
Spaces that were public (before you disabled the feature) become public again.

The App provides the controls for users to create, find and join public spaces.
Public spaces don't work while blocking internal communications
Public spaces are enabled by default, unless you are already blocking internal communications. The two features don't work together because public spaces defeat the purpose of blocking internal communications.

  If you try to enable public spaces while blocking internal communications, Control Hub invites you to enable internal communications. This choice puts you at risk of breaching your organization's internal security policy.

End-to-end encryption with identity verification for Webex meetings
Zero-Trust Security from Webex provides end-to-end encryption and strong identity verification in your scheduled and personal room meetings.
You must enable video devices at both the site and user levels for end-to-end encryption to work.
Webex for Government supports end-to-end encrypted meetings in Webex App and Webex Meetings.

Compare Webex End-to-End Encryption and Zero-Trust End-to-End Encryption
The Webex Suite offers two types of end-to-end encryption (E2EE):
Webex End-to-End Encryption — Security for messaging and user-generated c|||5h5d8ab.html<<<>>>tion — Security for messaging and user-generated content.
Zero-Trust End-to-End Encryption — Security for meetings (the main content of this article).
Both types provide an extra layer of encryption that safeguards data from interception attacks, but they differ in the levels of confidentiality that they offer.
Webex End-to-End Encryption
Webex End-to-End Encryption uses the Webex Key Management System* (KMS) to manage encryption keys for Webex messaging, file sharing, calendar, and whiteboarding services.
Data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
Webex App encrypts all user-generated content, such as messages, files, and whiteboards, before transmitting it over TLS.
This encrypted content i|||5h5d8ab.html<<<>>>transmitting it over TLS.
This encrypted content is stored on encrypted content servers in the Webex cloud.
This additional layer of security protects user data in transit from TLS interception attacks, and stored user data from potential bad actors in the Webex cloud.
The Webex cloud can use encryption keys, but only to decrypt data as required for core services such as:
Message indexing for search functions
Data loss prevention
File transcoding
eDiscovery
Data archival
For more information, see Zero-Trust Security for Webex.
* By default, our cloud-based KMS generates and distributes encryption keys. You have an option with Webex Hybrid Data Security (HDS) to manage your own, on-premises v|||5h5d8ab.html<<<>>>a Security (HDS) to manage your own, on-premises version of the key management system.
Zero-Trust End-to-End Encryption
Webex uses Zero-Trust End-to-End Encryption to offer higher levels of security and confidentiality in meetings.
Zero-Trust End-to-End Encryption uses the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol to exchange information so that participants in a Webex Meeting can create a common meeting encryption key.
The meeting encryption key is only accessible to the participants in the meeting. The Webex service can't access the meeting key—hence "Zero-Trust."
Scope of Zero-Trust security for Webex Meetings
Zero-Trust security for Webex supports the following in end-to-end encrypted meet|||5h5d8ab.html<<<>>>upports the following in end-to-end encrypted meetings:
Standards-based, formally verified cryptography.
Webex Room Devices (Room Series, Desk Series, and Webex Board).

A security icon which lets all meeting participants know at a glance that their meeting is secure, and when end-to-end encryption is enabled for the meeting.
Verbal verification of meeting attendees using a new Security Verification Code.
Up to 1000 participants.
Participants joining from a device must be one of the first 205 participants.

If a supported device has sensors but is assigned to a user, not a workspace, no data is collected.
Available sensors and how to enable them
You can enable sensors using the settings listed here. Read the Device configurations article for more information on how to use configurations.
Occupied: RoomAnalytics > PeoplePrecenseDetector: On
The device uses ultrasound and/or head detection to detect people in the workspace. One or both of these options needs to be set to On for the PeoplePrecenseDetector setting to work. Ultrasound and head detection can be turned on and off using |||9sewa8.html<<<>>>and head detection can be turned on and off using these settings:
RoomAnalytics > PeoplePresence > Input > HeadDetector: On/Off (default On)
RoomAnalytics > PeoplePresence > Input > Ultrasound: On/Off (default Off)
Occupants: RoomAnalytics > PeopleCountOutOfCall: On
The device calculates occupancy by detecting the number of people in the workspace. The camera tracks the number of people present during calls and if configured, outside of calls. Requires that a Quad Camera is connected for SX80, Codec Plus, and Codec Pro.
Sound level: RoomAnalytics > AmbientNoiseEstimation > Mode: On
Sound level shows the current sound level in the workspace.
Note that sound level is only reported when the amb|||9sewa8.html<<<>>>ote that sound level is only reported when the ambient noise estimation sensor is turned on.
Ambient noise: RoomAnalytics > AmbientNoiseEstimation > Mode: On
Ambient noise level is based on the noise estimation in the stationary noise reduction algorithm that is a part of the device acoustic echo canceller.
Temperature: Always enabled
The temperature sensor has an operating range 0–35 degrees Celsius (32–95 Fahrenheit). Placement of the device in the workspace might give variations in reported temperature.
Relative humidity: Always enabled
The humidity sensor reports relative humidity with an operating range between 20% and 90%. The sensor accuracy is +/- 10%.
Air quality: Always enabled
The|||9sewa8.html<<<>>>curacy is +/- 10%.
Air quality: Always enabled
The Volatile Organic Compound sensor (TVOC) measures indoor air quality. It measures the presence and quantity of gases emitted, for example, by solvents, smoke, and human breath. TVOC value renders a general index based on the total sum of those gases as defined by the Umweltbundesamt agency (UBA). The air quality information can be used, for example, to determine whether the workspace needs better ventilation.
A period of 72 hours is recommended for the sensor to stabilize in a new location. The sensor also needs to stabilize when the device has been turned off for a longer period of time.
Access historical data for workspaces

Configure your Webex Calling dial plan
You can control the dial plan for your Webex Calling deployment with outbound dialing codes. Customize extension lengths, routing prefixes, and dialing preferences (internal and external) to be compatible with the dialing habits of your users.
These settings are for internal dialing and are also available in the first-time setup wizard. As you change your dial plan, the example numbers in Control Hub update to show these changes.

You can configure outgoing calling permissions for a location. See these steps to configure outgoing calling permissions.

Log in to Control Hub at https://admin.webex.com/, go to Services > Calling > Service Settings, and then scroll to Internal Dialing.

Configure the following optional dialing preferences, as needed:
Location Routing Prefix Length—We recommend this setting if you have multiple locations. You can enter a length of 2-7 digits. If you have multiple locations with the same extension, users must dial a prefix when calling between locations. For example, if you have multiple stores, all with the extension 1000, you can configure a routing prefix for each store. If one store has a prefix of 888, you'd dial 8881000 to reach that store.

  Routing prefix lengths include the steering di|||nqufguf.html<<<>>>

  Routing prefix lengths include the steering digit. For example, if you set the routing prefix to four, only three digits can be used to specify the site.
Steering Digit in Routing Prefix— Choose the number which will be set as the first digit of every routing prefix.
Internal Extension Length—You can enter 2-6 digits and the default is 2.

  After you increase your extension length, existing speed dials to internal extensions are not automatically updated.

The routing prefix of each location must be unique. We recommend that the prefix length matches the length set at the organization level but it must be between 2-7 digits long.
External Dialing—Optionally, you can choose an outbound dial digit that users must dial to reach an outside line. The default is None and you can leave it if you don't require this dialing habit. If you do decide to use this feature, we recommend that you use a different number from your organization's steering digit.

  Users can include the outbound dial digit when making external calls to|||nqufguf.html<<<>>> outbound dial digit when making external calls to mimic how they dialed on legacy systems. However, all users can still make external calls without the outbound dial digit.

How ThousandEyes work in Troubleshooting
Network path provides the total round-trip loss, latency from the client to each hop, and any delays from one hop to the next
When a user with a ThousandEyes endpoint agent installed on their machine joins a meeting through the Webex App or with a Cisco collaboration device, a Network Path line |||gg3kd3.html<<<>>>a Cisco collaboration device, a Network Path line will be visible under Audio Quality in their participant details page. This line indicates the network path quality of audio data between the user’s client and the audio media node. In general, audio and video data travel the same path, and serviced by the same media node, so you can get a good sense of what the user's video quality is like, too. The network path quality is displayed as dotted lines. Each dotted line is based on the intervals set in the automated session test.
Loss (round-trip) reported by ThousandEyes in the Network Path is the loss percentage prior to application error recovery. A high packet loss prior to error recovery ma|||gg3kd3.html<<<>>>ery. A high packet loss prior to error recovery may not necessarily indicate a poor user experience because the application may have recovered some packet loss during retransmission. Webex App performs packet recovery to enhance the user's experience during poor network connections.
The loss (round-trip) won't match the packet loss value under the Audio Quality since the latter value is measured after error recovery. Audio Quality packet loss is a better indicator to the actual user experience.

  ThousandEyes AST starts capturing network path data as soon as the meeting starts. However, there could be a delay of up to five minutes before that data populates in Troubleshooting. When viewing |||gg3kd3.html<<<>>>t data populates in Troubleshooting. When viewing a live meeting, refresh the page after five minutes if data hasn't populated yet.
You can hover over a dotted line to see the user's latency (round-trip) average value during that interval. The color changes depending on the threshold that the value met. Thresholds are calculated as:
Poor (red)—Latency > 400ms or Loss (round-trip) > 5%
Good (good)—Latency < 300ms or Loss (round-trip) < 3%
Fair (yellow)—Neither of the above.
Unknown (grey)—Data isn't available from ThousandEyes to Control Hub. You may still be able to retrieve the metric from the ThousandEyes dashboard directly.

8.8-1.0.5201

We've introduced @meet as a new keyword, and new keyword modifiers :space and :myroom to control the behavior of the @meet and @webex keywords.
The keyword @meet and the compound keywords @meet:space or @webex:space all create a space in Webex App.
The compound keywords @meet:myroom and @webex:myroom work the same way as @webex, using the user's Cisco Webex Personal Room. Each option adds |||d2xpgm.html<<<>>>ser's Cisco Webex Personal Room. Each option adds the appropriate join details to the body of the meeting invitation.
Users with multiple Cisco Webex sites can still use @webex:<site> for the time being, but we strongly recommend configuring the My Personal Room setting in the Cisco Webex Teams app to specify which site @webex uses. This setting also indicates which site the app should monitor for participants entering the user's Personal Room lobby.
The @spark keyword will also continue to work for the time being. However, if your organization is currently using @spark, we recommend instead using @webex:space or @meet because @spark will eventually be removed at a future time once usage dro|||d2xpgm.html<<<>>>ntually be removed at a future time once usage drops.
8.8-1.0.5194
July 27, 2018
Fixed issue to allow parsing of SIP URI join links from meeting invitations using both the "sip%3A" and "sip:" formats. Previously "sip%3A" was not recognized and would not result in a join notification appearing in the Webex Teams app.
Fixed issue where in some cases @spark or @webex meetings mistakenly had double sip:sip:<URI> in the SIP URI joinable link. This caused failures when attempting to join these meetings. To address this issue, we no longer add sip: if it already exists.

Fixed the top priority issue configuring the Calendar Connector on Expressway X8.11, which was causing |||d2xpgm.html<<<>>> Connector on Expressway X8.11, which was causing two problems:
Entering an email address in the Discovery section of the Microsoft Exchange Configuration page causes the configuration to fail. Until we fix this issue, the only way to configure a new Calendar Connector or change the Exchange configuration is by leaving the Email Address field blank, which means that you will not be able to test your configuration as you save it. As a workaround, you can use the steps in Test Microsoft Exchange Autodiscovery and Impersonation to try to simulate the test, from a machine that has network conditions as similar as possible to the Expressway-C.
On the Webex Configuration page, using the Test Conne|||d2xpgm.html<<<>>>the Webex Configuration page, using the Test Connection button causes the same failure. The workaround is to click Save without testing.

For meeting invitations which only include a Webex Personal Room URL in the meeting body (with no SIP URI), clicking the join notification (OBTP) in the Webex Teams app will now join the meeting through the Webex Teams app. Previously, clicking the join notifications for these meetings would cross-launch the meeting in a Webex browser window.

April 27, 2018
Added localized text translations for "Join using Microsoft Skype for Business" link to @webex meeting invitations.
Fixed how the TLS configuration is applied for the Microsoft Exchange Autodiscover process. In the Calendar Connector Exchange configuration, there are two different settings that can dictate whether certificate validation is performed when making a secure connection. Each of these settings has an option of On or Off. If set to On, certificate validation is performed. If set to Off, no certificate vali|||d2xpgm.html<<<>>>n is performed. If set to Off, no certificate validation is performed. The settings and their intended scopes are as follows:
TLS Verify Mode—This setting is used when making a connection to Exchange.
LDAP TLS Verify Mode—This setting is used when making a connection to an LDAP server to search for Exchange Autodiscover SCP records.
Prior to the fix, the LDAP TLS Verify Mode was used for all connections during the Exchange Autodiscover process, regardless of whether performing an LDAP query or an Exchange request. So if LDAP TLS Verify Mode was On and TLS Verify Mode was Off, certificate validation was always performed when connecting to Exchange during Autodiscover. Conversely, if LDAP TLS |||d2xpgm.html<<<>>>ange during Autodiscover. Conversely, if LDAP TLS Verify Mode was Off and TLS Verify Mode was On, certificate validation was not performed when connecting to Exchange during Autodiscover.
After the fix, LDAP TLS Verify Mode is used only when making a connection to an LDAP server during Autodiscover, and TLS Verify Mode is used for all other connections involved in the Autodiscover process.
Fixed how the Calendar Connector searches for SCP pointers.
Autodiscover flow steps are explained in https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ee332364%28v=exchg.140%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396.

The second link explains the difference between the two types of SCP objects for Autodiscover provided by Exchange:
SCP pointers—These objects contain information that points to specific LDAP servers that should be used to locate Autodiscover SCP objects for the user's domain. SCP pointers are stamped with the following GUID: 67661d7F-8FC4-4fa7-BFAC-E1D7794C1F68.
SCP URLs—These objects contain URLs for Autodiscover endpoints. SCP URLs are stamped with the following GUID: 77378F46-2C66-4aa9-A6A6-3E7A48B19596.
Prior to the fix, the Calendar Connector search for SCP pointers was not working properly. However, sea|||d2xpgm.html<<<>>>CP pointers was not working properly. However, search for SCP URLs was working properly all along, and SCP URLs are the common type necessary for successful Autodiscover. There were no known reports of Calendar Connector Autodiscover failing due to unsuccessful SCP pointer lookup; the problem was only found by means of code review. With this fix, the Calendar Connector search for SCP pointers now works properly.
8.8-1.0.4963
April 20, 2018
Added "Join using Microsoft Skype for Business" link to @webex meeting invitations. This text currently only appears in English. Support for other languages will be released shortly.

April 13, 2018
If an autodiscovery URL for a user's email do|||d2xpgm.html<<<>>>2018
If an autodiscovery URL for a user's email domain was found via SCP lookup in Active Directory and the initial autodiscovery response from Exchange returned a RedirectTarget address, the Calendar Connector reused the original autodiscovery URL that was retrieved via SCP rather than a new URL based on the RedirectTarget address. This could cause a flow loop where the actual user settings were never retrieved and that user could never be assigned to a Calendar Connector or activated. This is now fixed so that the email domain of the RedirectTarget address is always used to acquire the next autodiscovery URL in the flow.

Turn activation emails on or off in Control Hub
Webex sends automated emails when licenses are assigned to users in Control Hub. If you turn this setting off, you'll need to send out your own communications instead.
The setting to automatically send emails is on by default. An email is automatically sent out to all newly added users. In this context, a newly added user is a user who has been assigned any free or paid licenses and has never logged into the Webex app before. These users aren't likely to have created a password, and may still need to verify their email addresses.

  It is highly recommended that you turn this s|||jv0u1db.html<<<>>>.

  It is highly recommended that you turn this setting off only if you have a well-thought-out system in place to manually onboard the users.
If you turn this setting off, an email won't be automatically sent out to newly added users. Instead, you can send activation emails to onboard a user individually or in bulk. These communications won't have the right email verification links or password creation logic, so we highly recommend leaving this setting on to utilize automatically generated activation emails.

  You can only suppress emails that are sent to new licensed users or inactive users, not the emails sent to users who converted from a free to a paid plan.

Sign in to Control Hub, |||jv0u1db.html<<<>>> a free to a paid plan.
1
Sign in to Control Hub, then select Organization settings and scroll to Email.
2
Toggle Automatic activation emails on or off.

  If you decide to turn this setting off, you'll need to send activation emails to your users individually or in bulk.
Best practices for manually sending activation emails
If you decide to turn this setting off and manually send activation emails, you should include these details:
Your company's goals and plan for the rollout.
The value and purpose of Webex App.
If you have purchased Webex App with Webex Meetings, include the link to the Personal Meeting Room (PMR).
Internal support links for your users.

Instructions for users to activate their account. They sign in on the SSO page using their company credentials and are automatically signed in to Webex App.
Tips for tracking inactive users
For inactive users, Control Hub provides the ability to send out reminder email invites. As these reminder email invites are suppressed, you must track these inactive users and send out reminder email invites manually.
Conversion from free to paid users
When users converted from free to paid users, the email invites are not suppressed, as users have to be notified of the conversion.|||jv0u1db.html<<<>>>sers have to be notified of the conversion.|||jv0u1db.html<<<>>>February 24, 2021 |

Data residency in Webex
We're enabling more Webex customers with the options to provision and store some or all of their data (including meetings, messaging, calling, contact center, user identities, encryption keys, analytics, and billing data) in Webex global data centers within their region.
Overview
The overall goal of data residency (formerly called data locality) in Webex is to store user data in regional data centers corresponding with the customer's location. This offering is available for new customers and provides the following high-level functionality:
Our systems store your identities, such as email address and use|||nm1m8zv.html<<<>>>ore your identities, such as email address and user ID, in your geographic region. Webex identity service processes client authentication requests locally in your region.
Users can continue to meet with, message, and call users in other organizations across the globe without the need for separate accounts in foreign clusters. This means that Webex doesn't proliferate additional personal data elements
Encryption keys for your users are created and stored in your organization's geographic region, and the Key Management Service (KMS) in your region handles requests for the keys to encrypt and decrypt spaces, messages, and content in Webex App.
Encrypted user-generated content (meetings, message|||nm1m8zv.html<<<>>>ncrypted user-generated content (meetings, messages, whiteboards, files and related metadata) is stored in the organization's geographic region.
We store data about your organization, such as verified domains, preferences, and security settings, in your geographic region.
Webex Partners in one region can create customer organizations in any region that we offer the services.
Webex Hybrid Services are supported in the region, including Hybrid Directory, Hybrid Calendar, Hybrid Calling, Video Mesh, Hybrid Data Security, and Hybrid Messages.
Webex offers data residency within the following regions

How we determine the data residency region
Messaging data reside|||nm1m8zv.html<<<>>>ne the data residency region
Messaging data residency
During provisioning, the administrator who sets up an organization sees a Country Selector drop-down menu in Control Hub. We determine the geographic region in which the organization's data resides based on the mapping of the selected country to its corresponding DC. When you create a trial and select a country that maps to the European region for example, the organization's user-generated content is stored in the region as well as the user identities and encryption keys.
To determine which region a country maps to, you can download the following Microsoft Excel file and select the country name from the drop-down menu: https://www.cisco.c|||nm1m8zv.html<<<>>> name from the drop-down menu: https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cloudCollaboration/wbxt/datalocality/CountryCodeGEOmapping.xlsx (The file begins to download immediately when you access the link.)
To enhance Webex Messaging data residency, we added a European geography (GEO) with data centers in Frankfurt and Amsterdam. The existing data centers in the United States of America continue to serve North America and the "Rest of World" (RoW).
Meetings Data residency
Meetings data is stored in a data center based on the time zone that you select for a Webex Meetings site during provisioning. For example, if you select a time zone from one of the European Union cities, then t|||nm1m8zv.html<<<>>>zone from one of the European Union cities, then the Meetings data will reside in the data center in Frankfurt. Meetings data for other time zones outside of the European Union will reside in whichever data center is closest to the selected city.

  At Cisco, we're committed to the protection and privacy of our customers’ data and personal information. The additional new data centers in Toronto, Canada, and Frankfurt, Germany, are part of this effort and complement existing data centers in the region, providing additional opportunities to host data in the EU and Canada. Since July 2021, new Webex customers from Europe can be provisioned to the data center in EU. Since July 2022, new Webex cu|||nm1m8zv.html<<<>>>e data center in EU. Since July 2022, new Webex customers from Canada can be provisioned to the data center in Canada. We also have a migration plan in place to provide existing customers with more flexibility, and  to manage the data migration to your region.
Webex Calling residency
Calling data is stored in the data center closest to a customer’s principal place of business, as provided to Cisco by the Partner during the ordering process. Data residency is available in key markets in North America, Europe, and Asia and continue to expand to more regions. For the list of Webex Calling data centers, please refer to the Webex Calling Privacy Data Sheet.
Webex Contact Center residency
Webex Co|||nm1m8zv.html<<<>>>ata Sheet.
Webex Contact Center residency
Webex Contact Center has achieved data residency in many countries we do business in North America, Europe and Asia and continues to expand.

Frequently asked questions for data residency
Where can I find out where my data is located?
Cisco is transparent about the data residency of all the Webex services. Customer or partner administrators can verify the location of their Webex Services for Meetings, Messaging, and common application data by going to Account > Info > Data Locations in Control Hub.
For Webex Contact Center service, you can confirm data residency by going to Contact Center > Settings > Service Details > Country of Operation in Control Hub.
For legacy customers who are eligible for migrating their data to the new data centers in their regions, refer to Data center migration plans|||nm1m8zv.html<<<>>>heir regions, refer to Data center migration plans for your organization’s data in Control Hub.
Why am I seeing a Country Selector during the organization provisioning process?
Cisco Webex is excited to provide customers the ability to localize certain Webex App data within “geo-based” data centers. During provisioning, the Country Selector determines which region will store a new customer organization's data. This includes organization identity, users' personal identities, encryption keys, and user-generated content (encrypted messages, boards, files, and related metadata).
Based on the Webex messages data center mapping pre-defined for each country, EU, Middle East, and Africa customers wi|||nm1m8zv.html<<<>>> country, EU, Middle East, and Africa customers will be provisioned to EU data centers; US, Canada, APAC, and South America customers will be provisioned to US data centers.
Note that Webex Meetings sites are local to many global regions. For more details, refer to Webex Meetings Global Data Centers. Customers from Canada can have their common application data and user profiles stored in Canadian data centers.
Which GEO locations are currently supported for Webex Messaging?
We introduced the following locations, with the intention of expanding to more locations later:
Europe—Hosted in the data centers in Frankfurt and Amsterdam. This region is mapped to countries in Continental Europe, the M|||nm1m8zv.html<<<>>>s mapped to countries in Continental Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
North America and Rest of the World (RoW)—Hosted in data centers in the United States.
What is the recommendation when selecting a country for the GEO location?
A customer’s organization data is created and maintained in the GEO location where the Webex App service is provisioned. During provisioning, the administrator will see a new option for selecting a country from a drop-down menu. This action permanently sets the GEO location for the organization’s users and encryption keys.
When selecting the country for an organization, consider the following recommendations:
If the organization's users are primarily based in o|||nm1m8zv.html<<<>>> the organization's users are primarily based in one country, select that country, even if it doesn't match the business address of the organization. This will improve the user experience and minimize latency by utilizing storage in the data centers closest to the users.
If the users are spread across multiple countries, select the country that has the highest user count. Keep in mind that all of the organization's users will have their data stored in the associated GEO location, even those who are not located in that country or GEO.
Ideally, the ship-to country and country of data residency are the same.

  We do not currently support migrating between GEO locations. When you create an orga|||nm1m8zv.html<<<>>>ing between GEO locations. When you create an organization in a GEO, it stays in that GEO.
To check the GEO location that a particular country maps to, download the CountryCodeGEOMapping.xlsx file, open the file in Microsoft Excel, and select the country from the drop-down menu.
Can my organization's users continue to collaborate with users in other regions?
Yes. Data residency strengthens the security and compliance features of Webex App without compromising the simplicity of the user experience. All users on our platform can communicate globally while retaining a single user identity.
How does data residency impact compliance and visibility across GEOs?
Compliance officers continue to have|||nm1m8zv.html<<<>>> across GEOs?
Compliance officers continue to have 100% visibility on user content regardless of where the data is stored (based on the Webex App ownership model). This means that compliance capabilities like eDiscovery and cloud access security broker (CASB) integrations will continue to allow you to monitor and take action on data loss prevention events, even if your users collaborate with those from other regions. The administrator controls that are already available allow you to disable external communication as needed.|||nm1m8zv.html<<<>>>May 15, 2023 |

Data residency in Webex
We're enabling more Webex customers with the options to provision and store some or all of their data (including meetings, messaging, calling, contact center, user identities, encryption keys, analytics, and billing data) in Webex global data centers within their region.
Overview
The overall goal of data residency (formerly called data locality) in Webex is to store user data in regional data centers corresponding with the customer's location. This offering is available for new customers and provides the following high-level functionality:
Our systems store your identities, such as email address and use|||WBX28754.html<<<>>>ore your identities, such as email address and user ID, in your geographic region. Webex identity service processes client authentication requests locally in your region.
Users can continue to meet with, message, and call users in other organizations across the globe without the need for separate accounts in foreign clusters. This means that Webex doesn't proliferate additional personal data elements
Encryption keys for your users are created and stored in your organization's geographic region, and the Key Management Service (KMS) in your region handles requests for the keys to encrypt and decrypt spaces, messages, and content in Webex App.
Encrypted user-generated content (meetings, message|||WBX28754.html<<<>>>ncrypted user-generated content (meetings, messages, whiteboards, files and related metadata) is stored in the organization's geographic region.
We store data about your organization, such as verified domains, preferences, and security settings, in your geographic region.
Webex Partners in one region can create customer organizations in any region that we offer the services.
Webex Hybrid Services are supported in the region, including Hybrid Directory, Hybrid Calendar, Hybrid Calling, Video Mesh, Hybrid Data Security, and Hybrid Messages.

How we determine the data residency region
Messaging data reside|||WBX28754.html<<<>>>ne the data residency region
Messaging data residency
During provisioning, the administrator who sets up an organization sees a Country Selector drop-down menu in Control Hub. We determine the geographic region in which the organization's data resides based on the mapping of the selected country to its corresponding DC. When you create a trial and select a country that maps to the European region for example, the organization's user-generated content is stored in the region as well as the user identities and encryption keys.
To determine which region a country maps to, you can download the following Microsoft Excel file and select the country name from the drop-down menu: https://www.cisco.c|||WBX28754.html<<<>>> name from the drop-down menu: https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cloudCollaboration/wbxt/datalocality/CountryCodeGEOmapping.xlsx (The file begins to download immediately when you access the link.)
To enhance Webex Messaging data residency, we added a European geography (GEO) with data centers in Frankfurt and Amsterdam. The existing data centers in the United States of America continue to serve North America and the "Rest of World" (RoW).
Meetings Data residency
Meetings data is stored in a data center based on the time zone that you select for a Webex Meetings site during provisioning. For example, if you select a time zone from one of the European Union cities, then t|||WBX28754.html<<<>>>zone from one of the European Union cities, then the Meetings data will reside in the data center in Frankfurt. Meetings data for other time zones outside of the European Union will reside in whichever data center is closest to the selected city.

  At Cisco, we're committed to the protection and privacy of our customers’ data and personal information. The additional new data centers in Toronto, Canada, and Frankfurt, Germany, are part of this effort and complement existing data centers in the region, providing additional opportunities to host data in the EU and Canada. Since July 2021, new Webex customers from Europe can be provisioned to the data center in EU. Since July 2022, new Webex cu|||WBX28754.html<<<>>>e data center in EU. Since July 2022, new Webex customers from Canada can be provisioned to the data center in Canada. We also have a migration plan in place to provide existing customers with more flexibility, and  to manage the data migration to your region.
Webex Calling residency
Calling data is stored in the data center closest to a customer’s principal place of business, as provided to Cisco by the Partner during the ordering process. Data residency is available in key markets in North America, Europe, and Asia and continue to expand to more regions. For the list of Webex Calling data centers, please refer to the Webex Calling Privacy Data Sheet.

Frequently asked questions for data residency
Where can I find out where my data is located?
Cisco is transparent about the data residency of all the Webex services. Customer or partner administrators can verify the location of their Webex Services for Meetings, Messaging, and common application data by going to Account > Info > Data Locations in Control Hub.
For Webex Contact Center service, you can confirm data residency by going to Contact Center > Settings > Service Details > Country of Operation in Control Hub.
For legacy customers who are eligible for migrating their data to the new data centers in their regions, refer to Data center migration plans|||n0p6xa1.html<<<>>>heir regions, refer to Data center migration plans for your organization’s data in Control Hub.
Why am I seeing a Country Selector during the organization provisioning process?
Cisco Webex is excited to provide customers the ability to localize certain Webex App data within “geo-based” data centers. During provisioning, the Country Selector determines which region will store a new customer organization's data. This includes organization identity, users' personal identities, encryption keys, and user-generated content (encrypted messages, boards, files, and related metadata).
Based on the Webex messages data center mapping pre-defined for each country, EU, Middle East, and Africa customers wi|||n0p6xa1.html<<<>>> country, EU, Middle East, and Africa customers will be provisioned to EU data centers; US, Canada, APAC, and South America customers will be provisioned to US data centers.
Note that Webex Meetings sites are local to many global regions. For more details, refer to Webex Meetings Global Data Centers. Customers from Canada can have their common application data and user profiles stored in Canadian data centers.
Which GEO locations are currently supported for Webex Messaging?
We introduced the following locations, with the intention of expanding to more locations later:
Europe—Hosted in the data centers in Frankfurt and Amsterdam. This region is mapped to countries in Continental Europe, the M|||n0p6xa1.html<<<>>>s mapped to countries in Continental Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
North America and Rest of the World (RoW)—Hosted in data centers in the United States.
What is the recommendation when selecting a country for the GEO location?
A customer’s organization data is created and maintained in the GEO location where the Webex App service is provisioned. During provisioning, the administrator will see a new option for selecting a country from a drop-down menu. This action permanently sets the GEO location for the organization’s users and encryption keys.
When selecting the country for an organization, consider the following recommendations:
If the organization's users are primarily based in o|||n0p6xa1.html<<<>>> the organization's users are primarily based in one country, select that country, even if it doesn't match the business address of the organization. This will improve the user experience and minimize latency by utilizing storage in the data centers closest to the users.
If the users are spread across multiple countries, select the country that has the highest user count. Keep in mind that all of the organization's users will have their data stored in the associated GEO location, even those who are not located in that country or GEO.
Ideally, the ship-to country and country of data residency are the same.

  We do not currently support migrating between GEO locations. When you create an orga|||n0p6xa1.html<<<>>>ing between GEO locations. When you create an organization in a GEO, it stays in that GEO.
To check the GEO location that a particular country maps to, download the CountryCodeGEOMapping.xlsx file, open the file in Microsoft Excel, and select the country from the drop-down menu.
Can my organization's users continue to collaborate with users in other regions?
Yes. Data residency strengthens the security and compliance features of Webex App without compromising the simplicity of the user experience. All users on our platform can communicate globally while retaining a single user identity.
How does data residency impact compliance and visibility across GEOs?
Compliance officers continue to have|||n0p6xa1.html<<<>>> across GEOs?
Compliance officers continue to have 100% visibility on user content regardless of where the data is stored (based on the Webex App ownership model). This means that compliance capabilities like eDiscovery and cloud access security broker (CASB) integrations will continue to allow you to monitor and take action on data loss prevention events, even if your users collaborate with those from other regions. The administrator controls that are already available allow you to disable external communication as needed.|||n0p6xa1.html<<<>>>May 15, 2023 |

Data residency in Webex
We're enabling more Webex customers with the options to provision and store some or all of their data (including meetings, messaging, calling, contact center, user identities, encryption keys, analytics, and billing data) in Webex global data centers within their region.
Overview
The overall goal of data residency (formerly called data locality) in Webex is to store user data in regional data centers corresponding with the customer's location. This offering is available for new customers and provides the following high-level functionality:
Our systems store your identities, such as email address and use|||s0lk5g.html<<<>>>ore your identities, such as email address and user ID, in your geographic region. Webex identity service processes client authentication requests locally in your region.
Users can continue to meet with, message, and call users in other organizations across the globe without the need for separate accounts in foreign clusters. This means that Webex doesn't proliferate additional personal data elements
Encryption keys for your users are created and stored in your organization's geographic region, and the Key Management Service (KMS) in your region handles requests for the keys to encrypt and decrypt spaces, messages, and content in Webex App.
Encrypted user-generated content (meetings, message|||s0lk5g.html<<<>>>ncrypted user-generated content (meetings, messages, whiteboards, files and related metadata) is stored in the organization's geographic region.
We store data about your organization, such as verified domains, preferences, and security settings, in your geographic region.
Webex Partners in one region can create customer organizations in any region that we offer the services.
Webex Hybrid Services are supported in the region, including Hybrid Directory, Hybrid Calendar, Hybrid Calling, Video Mesh, Hybrid Data Security, and Hybrid Messages.
Webex offers data residency within the following regions

How we determine the data residency region
Messaging data reside|||s0lk5g.html<<<>>>ne the data residency region
Messaging data residency
During provisioning, the administrator who sets up an organization sees a Country Selector drop-down menu in Control Hub. We determine the geographic region in which the organization's data resides based on the mapping of the selected country to its corresponding DC. When you create a trial and select a country that maps to the European region for example, the organization's user-generated content is stored in the region as well as the user identities and encryption keys.
To determine which region a country maps to, you can download the following Microsoft Excel file and select the country name from the drop-down menu: https://www.cisco.c|||s0lk5g.html<<<>>> name from the drop-down menu: https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cloudCollaboration/wbxt/datalocality/CountryCodeGEOmapping.xlsx (The file begins to download immediately when you access the link.)
To enhance Webex Messaging data residency, we added a European geography (GEO) with data centers in Frankfurt and Amsterdam. The existing data centers in the United States of America continue to serve North America and the "Rest of World" (RoW).
Meetings Data residency
Meetings data is stored in a data center based on the time zone that you select for a Webex Meetings site during provisioning. For example, if you select a time zone from one of the European Union cities, then t|||s0lk5g.html<<<>>>zone from one of the European Union cities, then the Meetings data will reside in the data center in Frankfurt. Meetings data for other time zones outside of the European Union will reside in whichever data center is closest to the selected city.

  At Cisco, we're committed to the protection and privacy of our customers’ data and personal information. The additional new data centers in Toronto, Canada, and Frankfurt, Germany, are part of this effort and complement existing data centers in the region, providing additional opportunities to host data in the EU and Canada. Since July 2021, new Webex customers from Europe can be provisioned to the data center in EU. Since July 2022, new Webex cu|||s0lk5g.html<<<>>>e data center in EU. Since July 2022, new Webex customers from Canada can be provisioned to the data center in Canada. We also have a migration plan in place to provide existing customers with more flexibility, and  to manage the data migration to your region.
Webex Calling residency
Calling data is stored in the data center closest to a customer’s principal place of business, as provided to Cisco by the Partner during the ordering process. Data residency is available in key markets in North America, Europe, and Asia and continue to expand to more regions. For the list of Webex Calling data centers, please refer to the Webex Calling Privacy Data Sheet.
Webex Contact Center residency
Webex Co|||s0lk5g.html<<<>>>ata Sheet.
Webex Contact Center residency
Webex Contact Center has achieved data residency in many countries we do business in North America, Europe and Asia and continues to expand. Based on the Country of Operation drop-down list that you selected on the Contact Center tab in the Setup wizard, the system creates the tenant in the closest data center based on the Country of Operation to Data Center mapping defined in Data Locality in Contact Center.

Noisy background
Poor audibility
Non-English words present in the audio or unsupported language

Voicemail transcription is available only for voicemails left in English.

Network Requirements for Webex Services
Network Requirements for Webex Services
Document Revision History
 
This article is intended for network administrators, particularly firewall and proxy security administrators who want to use Webex messaging and meetings services within their organization. It will help you configure your network to support the Webex Services used by HTTPS based Webex app and Webex Room devices, as well as Cisco IP Phones, Cisco video devices, and third-party devices that use SIP to connect to the Webex Meetings service.
This document primarily focuses on the network requirements of Webex cloud regist|||rdmb0.html<<<>>> on the network requirements of Webex cloud registered products that use HTTPS signaling to Webex cloud services, but also separately describes the network requirements of products that use SIP signaling to join Webex Meetings. These differences are summarized below:

If you are using a firewall only, note that filtering Webex signaling traffic using IP addresses is not supported, as the IP addresses used by Webex signaling services are dynamic and may change at any time. If your firewall supports URL filtering, configure the firewall to allow the Webex destination URLs listed in the section "Domains and URLs that need to be accessed for Webex Services".

Proxy servers are also commonly used as the only path that can forward HTTP based internet destined traffic to the enterprise firewall, allowing the firewall to limit outbound internet traffic to that originating from the Proxy server(s) only.

Video device join experience, from the meeting invitation
A standard email invitation to a Microsoft Teams meeting has meeting join details that include a clickable link to join the meeting from the Microsoft Teams client. The section may also include audio dial-in information—an audio conference ID and phone numbers to join as an audio-only participant. When you enable the video integration, the invitation join details section expands to include a block of video conferencing device join details.
Figure 1: Video join details in Microsoft Teams meeting invitation
When it is time to join the meeting, v|||2mlmjv.html<<<>>> invitation
When it is time to join the meeting, video device users can call the SIP video address listed under the Join with a video conferencing device heading. The device calls the Webex interactive voice response (IVR) system, which asks the caller to provide the VTC conference ID (Video Teleconference ID). Note that the VTC Conference ID is specifically for video devices and is different from the audio conference ID, if one is included for the meeting.
The SIP IVR video address is specific to your organization and is formed from your organization's Webex SIP subdomain in the format <subdomain>@m.webex.com.
Below the SIP IVR video address and VTC Conference ID, the invitation links to a |||2mlmjv.html<<<>>> and VTC Conference ID, the invitation links to a web page of alternate dialing instructions, which shows how to join the meeting by dialing directly.
Alternative video device join method—direct dial
Video callers can join the meeting directly, bypassing the IVR, by using a SIP address in the format <VTC Conference ID>.<subdomain>@m.webex.com. This method is listed at the top of the alternate VTC dialing instructions web page that the invitation links to. The web page also repeats the IVR prompt join details from the meeting invitation.

If you also enable the Webex Hybrid Calendar Service, devices can receive One Button to Push (OBTP) when schedulers invite them to Microsoft Teams meetings. An attendee using the device then simply presses the Join button when it's time to connect the device to the meeting. The meeting's entry shows the Microsoft Teams logo to indicate the type of meeting the attendee is joining.
Requirements for video integration with Microsoft Teams

Webex video integration licenses, one for each of the video devices that you plan to use with this integration.
The subscription for this service must be provisioned to your Webex organization in Control Hub and set up as described in this article.

  Licenses aren’t required during the Early Field Trial. To continue using the integration after the trial ends, either purchase licenses within 45 days |||2mlmjv.html<<<>>>ial ends, either purchase licenses within 45 days after the service becomes generally available or start a partner-led trial. Otherwise, the integration will stop working.
Webex devices registered to your Webex organization, or other SIP video devices that can make internet calls.
Your network call control must allow business-to-business (B2B) calling to Webex, and meet the Webex certificate requirements. For help, see How Do I Allow Webex Meetings Traffic on My Network?
Video devices must have the signaling and media network access defined in Ports and protocols for video integration traffic.

Create the video integration from Control Hub
Follow these steps to register Microsoft Teams to the Webex cloud, authorize service permissions with Microsoft, and enable Cisco video devices to join Microsoft Teams meetings. The setup wizard in https://admin.webex.com guides you through the process.
The Microsoft user has to authenticate at least two separate times during the setup. We recommend that the steps be done by a Micr|||2mlmjv.html<<<>>>tup. We recommend that the steps be done by a Microsoft administrator whose account has been given full administrator access to Control Hub.
Before you begin
Make sure that you've met all of the requirements in Requirements for video integration with Microsoft Teams.
If you haven't already done so, set up your Webex organization.
If you haven't already done so, add a subdomain for Webex SIP addresses in your organization.
In order to set up the video integration, you need the following administrator access:
Microsoft Tenant Global Administrator privileges in your organization
Microsoft Teams administration privileges within the tenant
Full administrator privileges for your own Webex organiza|||2mlmjv.html<<<>>>ministrator privileges for your own Webex organization, and a web browser that can access Control Hub. (See System requirements for Webex services for browser compatibility.)

  Users from any other organization that may have access to your Control Hub (such as Partner Admins) do not qualify. Use a full administrator account in the Webex organization that you are configuring.
You also need access to run Microsoft PowerShell commands to complete these setup steps.
MicrosoftTeams PowerShell module installed. (Version 2.0 or newer recommended.) See " Install Microsoft Teams PowerShell" on the Microsoft Documentation web site for more information.
At the time of this writing, Microsoft recommend|||2mlmjv.html<<<>>>.
At the time of this writing, Microsoft recommends PowerShell version 5.1 when using the MicrosoftTeams module, so we recommend using PowerShell on a Windows machine. See the PowerShell 5.1 system requirements on the Microsoft Documentation web site for more information.

If successful, you get feedback on which account and tenant you successfully signed into. If you get an error, repeat the command and refer to the Microsoft documentation for PowerShell for additional assistance.

  You must successfully sign in to your Teams tenant before proceeding to the remaining steps.
9
From the Video Integration Setup screen in Control Hub, click the clipboard button to copy the text of the New-CsVideoInteropServiceProvider command from the first text box and paste it into the PowerShell session. Then run the command.

  This command is specific to your tenant. The command will not work unles|||2mlmjv.html<<<>>>ic to your tenant. The command will not work unless you have imported the MicrosoftTeams PowerShell module and successfully signed in to your tenant as described in the previous step.
Take special care when copying the command to PowerShell so that the copied text is not modified in any way when handling the text. Sending the command through email, messaging clients, or other handling may result in having formatting added, character substitutions, or additional characters added which will break the configuration. PowerShell will not necessarily reject the malformed text. We recommend you directly copy and paste the command from Control Hub to PowerShell when possible or verify the text using|||2mlmjv.html<<<>>> PowerShell when possible or verify the text using a plain text editor before pasting to PowerShell.

To enable user jamie.smith@company.com:
Grant-CsTeamsVideoInteropServicePolicy -PolicyName CiscoServiceProviderEnabled -Identity jamie.smith@company.com
Paste the command into your PowerShell session and run it.
11
When you are done with the PowerShell commands, click Ok on the Video Integration Setup screen in Control Hub to complete the setup.
The PowerShell changes to the Microsoft tenant can take time to propagate in t|||2mlmjv.html<<<>>>e Microsoft tenant can take time to propagate in the Microsoft 365 environment. Microsoft warns this can take up to 6 hours, although it typically takes less than 20 minutes. You can test if the changes for an user have become active by having the user create test meetings in their Microsoft Outlook or Microsoft Teams client. If the changes have successfully propagated, you should see the video integration join details in the meeting invitation created (as shown in Overview). If the join details are not present, wait longer and repeat the test again.
What to do next
If you need to access the PowerShell command text after leaving the setup wizard, in the left side panel of Control Hub, click |||2mlmjv.html<<<>>>ard, in the left side panel of Control Hub, click on Hybrid under the Services category. On the video interoperability card with the Microsoft Teams logo, click Edit settings.
To take full advantage of the calendar and OBTP Join features of the Hybrid Calendar Service, make sure your Webex devices are either registered to the Webex cloud or linked to the cloud using Edge for devices.
Set up Hybrid Calendar Service if you want OBTP for devices. For help setting up OBTP with the Hybrid Calendar Service on Webex video devices, see Make it easier for video devices to join meetings with OBTP.
Join button and Hybrid Calendar considerations
As mentioned in Alternative video device join method—Join |||2mlmjv.html<<<>>>oned in Alternative video device join method—Join button, if you enable the Hybrid Calendar Service, you can further enhance the calling experience for your organization using One Button to Push (OBTP).
With OBTP, Webex devices in your organization automatically show a Join button shortly before the Microsoft Teams meeting starts, when they're included in the meeting:
Personal mode devices show the button if the user associated with the device accepts the meeting invitation. (The user must be enabled for the calendar service in Control Hub.)
Shared mode devices show the button if the room mailbox email address associated with the device accepts the meeting invitation. (The device's workspace|||2mlmjv.html<<<>>>ts the meeting invitation. (The device's workspace must be enabled for the calendar service in Control Hub.)
Exchange mailbox requirements for OBTP
The Hybrid Calendar Service will only process a meeting invitation (to add the details needed for OBTP) if the meeting scheduler or at least one of the invitees has the service enabled. If your organization doesn't have many calendar service enabled users, it may be common for a device invitation to trigger the processing, rather than the scheduler or a user. When this happens, it's critical that your Exchange configuration retain all of the details that the service needs in the invitation.

  You can now enable users without Webex licenses for t|||2mlmjv.html<<<>>> can now enable users without Webex licenses for the Hybrid Calendar Service.
By default, the Exchange Online settings delete the meeting details from invitations sent to room mailboxes. Apply the following PowerShell commands to the room mailboxes of all shared mode devices that you enable for the Hybrid Calendar Service:
Set-CalendarProcessing -identity "room" -DeleteComments $false
Set-CalendarProcessing -identity "room" -DeleteSubject $false
Set-CalendarProcessing -identity "room" -AddOrganizerToSubject $false
If you want to be able to forward invitations scheduled from outside of your Microsoft organization to the device, add the following command:
Set-CalendarProcessing -identity "room|||2mlmjv.html<<<>>>ng command:
Set-CalendarProcessing -identity "room" -ProcessExternalMeetingMessages $True
Supported device types for OBTP
The types of devices that support OBTP for Microsoft Teams meetings using the video integration and the Hybrid Calendar Service include:
Webex Board, Room, and Desk devices
Webex Room Kit and Room Phone
Cisco MX, SX, and DX series
The devices must be either registered to the Webex cloud or linked to the cloud using Edge for devices.

  If your devices are getting the Join button from Cisco TMS or Cisco TMSXE, they cannot get the Join button for Microsoft Teams meetings.
As an alternative, you can simplify joining for the affected devices by adding the SIP IVR video addres|||2mlmjv.html<<<>>>ffected devices by adding the SIP IVR video address of the Microsoft Teams meeting as a speed dial or macro.
Features and limitations
This section explains limitations and feature behavior for the Video Integration for Microsoft Teams.
Multiple organizations and tenants
We currently support a 1:1 relationship between Webex organizations and Microsoft 365 tenants:
A single Webex organization can interoperate with only one Microsoft 365 tenant.
Your Microsoft tenant can support multiple different video integrations; for example, the tenant can simultaneously interoperate with Cisco and Poly. However, the tenant can only have one integration of each type; so, one from Cisco, and one from Poly.
|||2mlmjv.html<<<>>>each type; so, one from Cisco, and one from Poly.
If you have multiple Webex organizations, choose one to interoperate with your Microsoft tenant using the Webex video integration.
Availability
We only support the Worldwide instance of Microsoft 365. ( Other instances which we do not support include USGovDoD, USGovGCCHigh, China, and Germany.)
We only support commercial Webex organizations in countries and regions where Webex paid subscriptions are available. (We don’t support FedRAMP-authorized Webex offerings.)
Video device interoperability
The integration only supports incoming SIP calls, not H.323 or IP calls. You can interwork these legacy protocols to SIP calls using a Cisco Expressway|||2mlmjv.html<<<>>>cy protocols to SIP calls using a Cisco Expressway deployment.
The integration doesn't support calling into a Microsoft Teams meeting using the Webex App. In addition, the integration doesn't support features that require pairing or connecting the Webex App to a device. This includes wireless sharing, dialing from the Webex App, and call control from the Webex App.
Interactive white boarding from Webex devices is not available for meetings on Microsoft Teams. Users can share whiteboards from the device as video content (BFCP support).
The integration doesn’t support audio-only participants. (Audio-only participants should call in using the PSTN gateway functionality for Microsoft Teams.)
Lay|||2mlmjv.html<<<>>>TN gateway functionality for Microsoft Teams.)
Layouts
Video integration participants can cycle through different layout options, by sending DTMF tones 2 and 8 from the device.
Participants can use the Cisco Touch interface to change layouts on devices that support ActiveControl. (This works with both cloud calling and SIP.)
Participants can see up to nine video streams at the same time. The number of visible streams also depends on the selected layout and the device type. Layouts show letter avatars instead of video when participants are not sending video streams to the meeting.
The integration supports single monitor + content, dual monitor + content, and TIP three monitor + content config|||2mlmjv.html<<<>>> + content, and TIP three monitor + content configurations. Panorama-specific layouts and camera behaviors are not supported and operate like a standard dual monitor configuration. The service does not support the iX immersive experience, but those devices may connect as TIP endpoints without immersive specific features. Supported layout families may differ depending on the device type.
Dual screen devices that receive incoming participant video on two monitors will have a fixed, Focus+Grid two screen layout for VIMT calls while more than one participant monitor is active. Using the layout controls will not change the active layout while two monitors display incoming participant video. Dual |||2mlmjv.html<<<>>>monitors display incoming participant video. Dual monitor configurations without a dedicated presentation monitor will switch to a single participant monitor while content sharing is active and layout controls will be operable for the participant monitor while content sharing is active. Three monitor configurations using a dedicated presentation monitor keep participant video on two monitors and thus remain in the fixed Focus+Grid layout regardless of content sharing.
Calendars and cross-organization invitations
Participants from outside your organization can join your Microsoft Teams meetings from their video devices by dialing your IVR video address (<yoursubdomain>@m.webex.com) and enteri|||2mlmjv.html<<<>>>o address (<yoursubdomain>@m.webex.com) and entering the VTC conference ID for the meeting at the prompt, or by using your direct dial alternative (<VTC Conference ID>.<yoursubdomain>@m.webex.com).
The video integration for your Microsoft tenant doesn’t enable dialing into meetings hosted by other Microsoft customers. When dialing into a Teams meeting that is hosted by another Microsoft tenant, you must use the video address of the video integration that is enabled for that tenant.
Webex Hybrid Calendar Service does not create OBTP join entries for meetings containing join details supplied by other (non-Cisco) video integrations. (For example, a Hybrid Calendar enabled workspace will not sho|||2mlmjv.html<<<>>>, a Hybrid Calendar enabled workspace will not show the One Button to Push (OBTP) Join button for a Pexip invitation.)
Known Hybrid Calendar limitations, arising from missing comments/body details or organizer-based processing, also apply when processing OBTP for Microsoft Teams meetings.
Meeting features
Video integration participants don't have controls to start or stop meeting recordings. Microsoft Teams users must manage meeting recording.
Content sharing uses BFCP and is subject to the limitations of that protocol, including no ability to share applications or allow remote control.
If meeting policies or a meeting organizer limits who can share content in a Teams meeting using the Who C|||2mlmjv.html<<<>>>n share content in a Teams meeting using the Who Can Present? meeting option, then video integration participants must have the 'Presenter' role to share content in the meeting. When joining through the video integration, a caller is an 'attendee' by default. Callers who join as trusted callers will have the presenter role assigned automatically, regardless of the value set in Who Can Present?. Meeting organizers can toggle a participant's role on the fly using the participant list in their Teams client.
If meeting policies or a meeting organizer limits who can share content in the Teams meeting using the Who Can Present? meeting option, sharing content will not work as expected for video in|||2mlmjv.html<<<>>>ing content will not work as expected for video integration participants who only have the 'attendee' role in the meeting. The caller will be able to start sharing on their device, but their content will not be seen by other participants in the meeting. Sharing may also interfere with receiving content from another user.
Microsoft Teams chat isn't available to video integration participants.
Microsoft Teams white boarding isn't available to video integration participants.
When Microsoft Teams participants share, only the sharing Desktop or Window options are viewable by video integration participants. Video integration participants can't view files or the PowerPoint or Whiteboard options sha|||2mlmjv.html<<<>>> files or the PowerPoint or Whiteboard options shared from the Microsoft Teams client.
Microsoft Teams participants can mute video integration participants, but can't unmute them for privacy reasons.
Video integration participants can mute and unmute themselves either on the device (local mute) or by sending DTMF *6 (server-side mute). The participant sees a confirmation message on the device when sending *6.
In the participant list, you only see a video integration participant's mute indicator turn on if they mute themselves with *6 or if Microsoft Teams participants mute them. (Local mute doesn't update the roster.)
If the mute indicator is on, how the participant unmutes can affect the in|||2mlmjv.html<<<>>> on, how the participant unmutes can affect the indicator differently depending on the type of calling that the device uses:
Cloud calling—The participant can unmute locally to clear the mute indicator in the participant list.
SIP or on-prem calling—Only unmuting using *6 clears the mute indicator in the roster. (Unmuting locally doesn't clear the mute indicator in the roster.)
Webex devices connecting through the video integration have the Webex IVR and splash screens localized to the language set in the device. US English is the default for all other scenarios. Localization is supported for Webex devices using cloud calling or SIP calling (requires CE9.14.3 or newer.)
Microsoft Teams lobby|||2mlmjv.html<<<>>>requires CE9.14.3 or newer.)
Microsoft Teams lobby
Trusted devices from your own organization can streamline how they join meetings by automatically bypassing the Microsoft Teams lobby. A device is considered trusted in either of the following cases:
It is a Webex device using cloud calling, and registered to the Webex organization where you deploy the video integration.
It is a device using on-prem or SIP calling, which uses SIP TLS and presents a certificate that includes one of the verified SIP domains for the Webex organization where you deploy the video integration.

  If you enable TLS verification on your SIP calling to Webex, your TLS verification should check for the subject name si|||2mlmjv.html<<<>>> verification should check for the subject name sip.webex.com (rather than m.webex.com).
For help with Cisco Expressway, see Configure Expressway for mutual TLS authentication
If a meeting organizer sets the Who can bypass the lobby? meeting option to 'Organizers and me' or 'People I invite', callers attempting to join as trusted callers will be placed into the lobby of the Teams meeting. The caller will see the 'Waiting for others' splash screen instead of the expected lobby splash screen.
If you disable Anonymous users can join a meeting in the Microsoft Teams tenant settings, then video integration participants cannot join through the lobby. Video integration participants who would normal|||2mlmjv.html<<<>>>y. Video integration participants who would normally bypass the lobby will still be able to join Microsoft Teams meetings.
Networking
Calls to the video integration do not use Webex Video Mesh nodes; traffic is direct from the device to the cloud.
The specialized media clusters used by the video integration for Microsoft Teams are not part of the reachability tests that Webex-registered devices perform. Failure to open access to any of the media cluster IP ranges can lead to call failures. The integration attempts to use the optimal media cluster for each call based on where the caller originates. However, you must allow access to all media clusters because the media cluster used can vary ba|||2mlmjv.html<<<>>>lusters because the media cluster used can vary based on run-time conditions.|||2mlmjv.html<<<>>>January 20, 2023 |

Deploy the Webex video integration for Microsoft Teams
Overview
This integration enables your video devices to join Microsoft Teams meetings. The integration applies to Webex devices, and other SIP-capable video devices, whether they register to Webex or to your on-premises infrastructure.
Here's how the integration enhances the device user's experience when they join Microsoft Teams meetings hosted in your organization:

A standard email invitation to a Microsoft Teams meeting has meeting join details that include a clickable link to join the meeting from the Microsoft Teams client. The section may also include audio dial-in information—an audio conference ID and phone numbers to join as an audio-only participant. When you enable the video integration, the invitation join details section expands to include a block of video conferencing device join details.

When it is time to join the meeting, v|||gpr322.html<<<>>> invitation
When it is time to join the meeting, video device users can call the SIP video address listed under the Join with a video conferencing device heading. The device calls the Webex interactive voice response (IVR) system, which asks the caller to provide the VTC conference ID (Video Teleconference ID). Note that the VTC Conference ID is specifically for video devices and is different from the audio conference ID, if one is included for the meeting.
The SIP IVR video address is specific to your organization and is formed from your organization's Webex SIP subdomain in the format <subdomain>@m.webex.com.

Create the video integration from Control Hub
Follow these steps to register Microsoft Teams to the Webex cloud, authorize service permissions with Microsoft, and enable Cisco video devices to join Microsoft Teams meetings. The setup wizard in https://admin.webex.com guides you through the process.
The Microsoft user has to authenticate at least two separate times during the setup. We recommend that the steps be done by a Micr|||gpr322.html<<<>>>tup. We recommend that the steps be done by a Microsoft administrator whose account has been given full administrator access to Control Hub.
Before you begin
Make sure that you've met all of the requirements in Requirements for video integration with Microsoft Teams.
If you haven't already done so, set up your Webex organization.
If you haven't already done so, add a subdomain for Webex SIP addresses in your organization.
In order to set up the video integration, you need the following administrator access:
Microsoft Tenant Global Administrator privileges in your organization
Microsoft Teams administration privileges within the tenant
Full administrator privileges for your own Webex organiza|||gpr322.html<<<>>>ministrator privileges for your own Webex organization, and a web browser that can access Control Hub. (See System requirements for Webex services for browser compatibility.)

  Users from any other organization that may have access to your Control Hub (such as Partner Admins) do not qualify. Use a full administrator account in the Webex organization that you are configuring.
You also need access to run Microsoft PowerShell commands to complete these setup steps.
MicrosoftTeams PowerShell module installed. (Version 2.0 or newer recommended.) See " Install Microsoft Teams PowerShell" on the Microsoft Documentation web site for more information.
At the time of this writing, Microsoft recommend|||gpr322.html<<<>>>.
At the time of this writing, Microsoft recommends PowerShell version 5.1 when using the MicrosoftTeams module, so we recommend using PowerShell on a Windows machine. See the PowerShell 5.1 system requirements on the Microsoft Documentation web site for more information.

From the Video Integration Setup screen in Control Hub, click the clipboard button to copy the text of the New-CsVideoInteropServiceProvider command from the first text box and paste it into the PowerShell session. Then run the command.

  This command is specific to your tenant. The command will not work unles|||gpr322.html<<<>>>ic to your tenant. The command will not work unless you have imported the MicrosoftTeams PowerShell module and successfully signed in to your tenant as described in the previous step.
Take special care when copying the command to PowerShell so that the copied text is not modified in any way when handling the text. Sending the command through email, messaging clients, or other handling may result in having formatting added, character substitutions, or additional characters added which will break the configuration. PowerShell will not necessarily reject the malformed text. We recommend you directly copy and paste the command from Control Hub to PowerShell when possible or verify the text using|||gpr322.html<<<>>> PowerShell when possible or verify the text using a plain text editor before pasting to PowerShell.

If the changes have successfully propagated, you should see the video integration join details in the meeting invitation created (as shown in Overview). If the join details are not present, wait longer and repeat the test again.
What to do next
If you need to access the PowerShell command text after leaving the setup wizard, in the left side panel of Control Hub, click |||gpr322.html<<<>>>ard, in the left side panel of Control Hub, click on Hybrid under the Services category. On the video interoperability card with the Microsoft Teams logo, click Edit settings.
To take full advantage of the calendar and OBTP Join features of the Hybrid Calendar Service, make sure your Webex devices are either registered to the Webex cloud or linked to the cloud using Edge for devices.
Set up Hybrid Calendar Service if you want OBTP for devices. For help setting up OBTP with the Hybrid Calendar Service on Webex video devices, see Make it easier for video devices to join meetings with OBTP.
Join button and Hybrid Calendar considerations
As mentioned in Alternative video device join method—Join |||gpr322.html<<<>>>oned in Alternative video device join method—Join button, if you enable the Hybrid Calendar Service, you can further enhance the calling experience for your organization using One Button to Push (OBTP).
With OBTP, Webex devices in your organization automatically show a Join button shortly before the Microsoft Teams meeting starts, when they're included in the meeting:
Personal mode devices show the button if the user associated with the device accepts the meeting invitation. (The user must be enabled for the calendar service in Control Hub.)
Shared mode devices show the button if the room mailbox email address associated with the device accepts the meeting invitation. (The device's workspace|||gpr322.html<<<>>>ts the meeting invitation. (The device's workspace must be enabled for the calendar service in Control Hub.)
Exchange mailbox requirements for OBTP
The Hybrid Calendar Service will only process a meeting invitation (to add the details needed for OBTP) if the meeting scheduler or at least one of the invitees has the service enabled. If your organization doesn't have many calendar service enabled users, it may be common for a device invitation to trigger the processing, rather than the scheduler or a user. When this happens, it's critical that your Exchange configuration retain all of the details that the service needs in the invitation.

  You can now enable users without Webex licenses for t|||gpr322.html<<<>>> can now enable users without Webex licenses for the Hybrid Calendar Service.
By default, the Exchange Online settings delete the meeting details from invitations sent to room mailboxes. Apply the following PowerShell commands to the room mailboxes of all shared mode devices that you enable for the Hybrid Calendar Service:
Set-CalendarProcessing -identity "room" -DeleteComments $false
Set-CalendarProcessing -identity "room" -DeleteSubject $false
Set-CalendarProcessing -identity "room" -AddOrganizerToSubject $false
If you want to be able to forward invitations scheduled from outside of your Microsoft organization to the device, add the following command:
Set-CalendarProcessing -identity "room|||gpr322.html<<<>>>ng command:
Set-CalendarProcessing -identity "room" -ProcessExternalMeetingMessages $True
Supported device types for OBTP
The types of devices that support OBTP for Microsoft Teams meetings using the video integration and the Hybrid Calendar Service include:
Webex Board, Room, and Desk devices
Webex Room Kit and Room Phone
Cisco MX, SX, and DX series
The devices must be either registered to the Webex cloud or linked to the cloud using Edge for devices.

  If your devices are getting the Join button from Cisco TMS or Cisco TMSXE, they cannot get the Join button for Microsoft Teams meetings.
As an alternative, you can simplify joining for the affected devices by adding the SIP IVR video addres|||gpr322.html<<<>>>ffected devices by adding the SIP IVR video address of the Microsoft Teams meeting as a speed dial or macro.
Features and limitations
This section explains limitations and feature behavior for the Video Integration for Microsoft Teams.
Multiple organizations and tenants
We currently support a 1:1 relationship between Webex organizations and Microsoft 365 tenants:
A single Webex organization can interoperate with only one Microsoft 365 tenant.
Your Microsoft tenant can support multiple different video integrations; for example, the tenant can simultaneously interoperate with Cisco and Poly. However, the tenant can only have one integration of each type; so, one from Cisco, and one from Poly.
|||gpr322.html<<<>>>each type; so, one from Cisco, and one from Poly.
If you have multiple Webex organizations, choose one to interoperate with your Microsoft tenant using the Webex video integration.
Availability
We only support the Worldwide instance of Microsoft 365. ( Other instances which we do not support include USGovDoD, USGovGCCHigh, China, and Germany.)
We only support commercial Webex organizations in countries and regions where Webex paid subscriptions are available. (We don’t support FedRAMP-authorized Webex offerings.)
Video device interoperability
The integration only supports incoming SIP calls, not H.323 or IP calls. You can interwork these legacy protocols to SIP calls using a Cisco Expressway|||gpr322.html<<<>>>cy protocols to SIP calls using a Cisco Expressway deployment.
The integration doesn't support calling into a Microsoft Teams meeting using the Webex App. In addition, the integration doesn't support features that require pairing or connecting the Webex App to a device. This includes wireless sharing, dialing from the Webex App, and call control from the Webex App.
Interactive white boarding from Webex devices is not available for meetings on Microsoft Teams. Users can share whiteboards from the device as video content (BFCP support).
The integration doesn’t support audio-only participants. (Audio-only participants should call in using the PSTN gateway functionality for Microsoft Teams.)
Lay|||gpr322.html<<<>>>TN gateway functionality for Microsoft Teams.)
Layouts
Video integration participants can cycle through different layout options, by sending DTMF tones 2 and 8 from the device.
Participants can use the Cisco Touch interface to change layouts on devices that support ActiveControl. (This works with both cloud calling and SIP.)
Participants can see up to nine video streams at the same time. The number of visible streams also depends on the selected layout and the device type. Layouts show letter avatars instead of video when participants are not sending video streams to the meeting.
The integration supports single monitor + content, dual monitor + content, and TIP three monitor + content config|||gpr322.html<<<>>> + content, and TIP three monitor + content configurations. Panorama-specific layouts and camera behaviors are not supported and operate like a standard dual monitor configuration. The service does not support the iX immersive experience, but those devices may connect as TIP endpoints without immersive specific features. Supported layout families may differ depending on the device type.
Dual screen devices that receive incoming participant video on two monitors will have a fixed, Focus+Grid two screen layout for VIMT calls while more than one participant monitor is active. Using the layout controls will not change the active layout while two monitors display incoming participant video. Dual |||gpr322.html<<<>>>monitors display incoming participant video. Dual monitor configurations without a dedicated presentation monitor will switch to a single participant monitor while content sharing is active and layout controls will be operable for the participant monitor while content sharing is active. Three monitor configurations using a dedicated presentation monitor keep participant video on two monitors and thus remain in the fixed Focus+Grid layout regardless of content sharing.
Calendars and cross-organization invitations
Participants from outside your organization can join your Microsoft Teams meetings from their video devices by dialing your IVR video address (<yoursubdomain>@m.webex.com) and enteri|||gpr322.html<<<>>>o address (<yoursubdomain>@m.webex.com) and entering the VTC conference ID for the meeting at the prompt, or by using your direct dial alternative (<VTC Conference ID>.<yoursubdomain>@m.webex.com).
The video integration for your Microsoft tenant doesn’t enable dialing into meetings hosted by other Microsoft customers. When dialing into a Teams meeting that is hosted by another Microsoft tenant, you must use the video address of the video integration that is enabled for that tenant.
Webex Hybrid Calendar Service does not create OBTP join entries for meetings containing join details supplied by other (non-Cisco) video integrations. (For example, a Hybrid Calendar enabled workspace will not sho|||gpr322.html<<<>>>, a Hybrid Calendar enabled workspace will not show the One Button to Push (OBTP) Join button for a Pexip invitation.)
Known Hybrid Calendar limitations, arising from missing comments/body details or organizer-based processing, also apply when processing OBTP for Microsoft Teams meetings.
Meeting features
Video integration participants don't have controls to start or stop meeting recordings. Microsoft Teams users must manage meeting recording.
Content sharing uses BFCP and is subject to the limitations of that protocol, including no ability to share applications or allow remote control.
If meeting policies or a meeting organizer limits who can share content in a Teams meeting using the Who C|||gpr322.html<<<>>>n share content in a Teams meeting using the Who Can Present? meeting option, then video integration participants must have the 'Presenter' role to share content in the meeting. When joining through the video integration, a caller is an 'attendee' by default. Callers who join as trusted callers will have the presenter role assigned automatically, regardless of the value set in Who Can Present?. Meeting organizers can toggle a participant's role on the fly using the participant list in their Teams client.
If meeting policies or a meeting organizer limits who can share content in the Teams meeting using the Who Can Present? meeting option, sharing content will not work as expected for video in|||gpr322.html<<<>>>ing content will not work as expected for video integration participants who only have the 'attendee' role in the meeting. The caller will be able to start sharing on their device, but their content will not be seen by other participants in the meeting. Sharing may also interfere with receiving content from another user.
Microsoft Teams chat isn't available to video integration participants.
Microsoft Teams white boarding isn't available to video integration participants.
When Microsoft Teams participants share, only the sharing Desktop or Window options are viewable by video integration participants. Video integration participants can't view files or the PowerPoint or Whiteboard options sha|||gpr322.html<<<>>> files or the PowerPoint or Whiteboard options shared from the Microsoft Teams client.
Microsoft Teams participants can mute video integration participants, but can't unmute them for privacy reasons.
Video integration participants can mute and unmute themselves either on the device (local mute) or by sending DTMF *6 (server-side mute). The participant sees a confirmation message on the device when sending *6.
In the participant list, you only see a video integration participant's mute indicator turn on if they mute themselves with *6 or if Microsoft Teams participants mute them. (Local mute doesn't update the roster.)
If the mute indicator is on, how the participant unmutes can affect the in|||gpr322.html<<<>>> on, how the participant unmutes can affect the indicator differently depending on the type of calling that the device uses:
Cloud calling—The participant can unmute locally to clear the mute indicator in the participant list.
SIP or on-prem calling—Only unmuting using *6 clears the mute indicator in the roster. (Unmuting locally doesn't clear the mute indicator in the roster.)
Webex devices connecting through the video integration have the Webex IVR and splash screens localized to the language set in the device. US English is the default for all other scenarios. Localization is supported for Webex devices using cloud calling or SIP calling (requires CE9.14.3 or newer.)
Microsoft Teams lobby|||gpr322.html<<<>>>requires CE9.14.3 or newer.)
Microsoft Teams lobby
Trusted devices from your own organization can streamline how they join meetings by automatically bypassing the Microsoft Teams lobby. A device is considered trusted in either of the following cases:
It is a Webex device using cloud calling, and registered to the Webex organization where you deploy the video integration.
It is a device using on-prem or SIP calling, which uses SIP TLS and presents a certificate that includes one of the verified SIP domains for the Webex organization where you deploy the video integration.

  If you enable TLS verification on your SIP calling to Webex, your TLS verification should check for the subject name si|||gpr322.html<<<>>> verification should check for the subject name sip.webex.com (rather than m.webex.com).
For help with Cisco Expressway, see Configure Expressway for mutual TLS authentication
If a meeting organizer sets the Who can bypass the lobby? meeting option to 'Organizers and me' or 'People I invite', callers attempting to join as trusted callers will be placed into the lobby of the Teams meeting. The caller will see the 'Waiting for others' splash screen instead of the expected lobby splash screen.
If you disable Anonymous users can join a meeting in the Microsoft Teams tenant settings, then video integration participants cannot join through the lobby. Video integration participants who would normal|||gpr322.html<<<>>>y. Video integration participants who would normally bypass the lobby will still be able to join Microsoft Teams meetings.
Networking
Calls to the video integration do not use Webex Video Mesh nodes; traffic is direct from the device to the cloud.
The specialized media clusters used by the video integration for Microsoft Teams are not part of the reachability tests that Webex-registered devices perform. Failure to open access to any of the media cluster IP ranges can lead to call failures. The integration attempts to use the optimal media cluster for each call based on where the caller originates. However, you must allow access to all media clusters because the media cluster used can vary ba|||gpr322.html<<<>>>lusters because the media cluster used can vary based on run-time conditions.|||gpr322.html<<<>>>January 20, 2023 |

Change your Webex SIP address
You can update the subdomain for the Webex SIP address for your organization.
We recommend that you change the Webex SIP subdomain after hours or during a maintenance window, because the domain doesn't change immediately.
Before you begin
For Hybrid Calling for Webex Devices deployments, when you're migrating an existing SIP address with the ciscospark.com address, use the Migrate Cisco Spark Hybrid Call Service Organization to the Cisco Webex Domain guide.

Click Save, read the notification, then click Yes to confirm.
This triggers the migration process that adds Webex SIP addresses. You can click on View update history (tasks) to see the status of the SIP address changes. If there are any issues, you can review the errors, and then click Rerun Task if necessary.

  After the migration completes, Webex-registered devices in a Workspace or Personal Mode (Room, Desk, and Board) may show the ciscospark.com address as Primary. This can take up to 24 hours to fix, but calling is not affected during this time. The new, Webex address should show as Primary after that time.

Deploy the Webex video integration for Microsoft Teams
Overview
This integration enables your video devices to join Microsoft Teams meetings. The integration applies to Webex devices, and other SIP-capable video devices, whether they register to Webex or to your on-premises infrastructure.
Here's how the integration enhances the device user's experience when they join Microsoft Teams meetings hosted in your organization:
Webex meeting experience—multi-screen with flexible layout options
Participant list showing both Microsoft and video integration participants
Bi-directional content sharing between the device and Microso|||n3hi0z8.html<<<>>>nal content sharing between the device and Microsoft Teams
Recording indicator on the device
Video device join experience, from the meeting invitation
A standard email invitation to a Microsoft Teams meeting has meeting join details that include a clickable link to join the meeting from the Microsoft Teams client. The section may also include audio dial-in information—an audio conference ID and phone numbers to join as an audio-only participant. When you enable the video integration, the invitation join details section expands to include a block of video conferencing device join details.
Figure 1: Video join details in Microsoft Teams meeting invitation
When it is time to join the meeting, v|||n3hi0z8.html<<<>>> invitation
When it is time to join the meeting, video device users can call the SIP video address listed under the Join with a video conferencing device heading. The device calls the Webex interactive voice response (IVR) system, which asks the caller to provide the VTC conference ID (Video Teleconference ID). Note that the VTC Conference ID is specifically for video devices and is different from the audio conference ID, if one is included for the meeting.
The SIP IVR video address is specific to your organization and is formed from your organization's Webex SIP subdomain in the format <subdomain>@m.webex.com.
Below the SIP IVR video address and VTC Conference ID, the invitation links to a |||n3hi0z8.html<<<>>> and VTC Conference ID, the invitation links to a web page of alternate dialing instructions, which shows how to join the meeting by dialing directly.
Alternative video device join method—direct dial
Video callers can join the meeting directly, bypassing the IVR, by using a SIP address in the format <VTC Conference ID>.<subdomain>@m.webex.com. This method is listed at the top of the alternate VTC dialing instructions web page that the invitation links to. The web page also repeats the IVR prompt join details from the meeting invitation.

If you also enable the |||n3hi0z8.html<<<>>>ce join method—Join button
If you also enable the Webex Hybrid Calendar Service, devices can receive One Button to Push (OBTP) when schedulers invite them to Microsoft Teams meetings. An attendee using the device then simply presses the Join button when it's time to connect the device to the meeting. The meeting's entry shows the Microsoft Teams logo to indicate the type of meeting the attendee is joining.
Requirements for video integration with Microsoft Teams
Requirement
Notes
An active Webex organization
If you do not yet have an active Webex organization, we will provision one for you when you purchase the video integration.
A Microsoft 365 tenant with Microsoft Teams accounts for users |||n3hi0z8.html<<<>>>65 tenant with Microsoft Teams accounts for users in the organization
The setup process requires an account that can sign in as a Global administrator for the tenant to grant application permissions, and a Microsoft Teams administrator account for the tenant that can execute PowerShell commands.
Webex video integration licenses, one for each of the video devices that you plan to use with this integration.
The subscription for this service must be provisioned to your Webex organization in Control Hub and set up as described in this article.

  Licenses aren’t required during the Early Field Trial. To continue using the integration after the trial ends, either purchase licenses within 45 days |||n3hi0z8.html<<<>>>ial ends, either purchase licenses within 45 days after the service becomes generally available or start a partner-led trial. Otherwise, the integration will stop working.
Webex devices registered to your Webex organization, or other SIP video devices that can make internet calls.
Your network call control must allow business-to-business (B2B) calling to Webex, and meet the Webex certificate requirements. For help, see How Do I Allow Webex Meetings Traffic on My Network?
Video devices must have the signaling and media network access defined in Ports and protocols for video integration traffic.

To take full advantage of the calendar and OBTP Join features of the Hybrid Calendar Service, make sure your Webex devices are either registered to the Webex cloud or linked to the cloud using Edge for devices.
Set up Hybrid Calendar Service if you want OBTP for devices. For help setting up OBTP with the Hybrid Calendar Service on Webex video devices, see Make it easier for video devices to join meetings with OBTP.
Join button and Hybrid Calendar considerations
As mentioned in Alternative video device join method—Join |||n3hi0z8.html<<<>>>oned in Alternative video device join method—Join button, if you enable the Hybrid Calendar Service, you can further enhance the calling experience for your organization using One Button to Push (OBTP).
With OBTP, Webex devices in your organization automatically show a Join button shortly before the Microsoft Teams meeting starts, when they're included in the meeting:
Personal mode devices show the button if the user associated with the device accepts the meeting invitation. (The user must be enabled for the calendar service in Control Hub.)
Shared mode devices show the button if the room mailbox email address associated with the device accepts the meeting invitation. (The device's workspace|||n3hi0z8.html<<<>>>ts the meeting invitation. (The device's workspace must be enabled for the calendar service in Control Hub.)
Exchange mailbox requirements for OBTP
The Hybrid Calendar Service will only process a meeting invitation (to add the details needed for OBTP) if the meeting scheduler or at least one of the invitees has the service enabled. If your organization doesn't have many calendar service enabled users, it may be common for a device invitation to trigger the processing, rather than the scheduler or a user. When this happens, it's critical that your Exchange configuration retain all of the details that the service needs in the invitation.

  You can now enable users without Webex licenses for t|||n3hi0z8.html<<<>>> can now enable users without Webex licenses for the Hybrid Calendar Service.
By default, the Exchange Online settings delete the meeting details from invitations sent to room mailboxes. Apply the following PowerShell commands to the room mailboxes of all shared mode devices that you enable for the Hybrid Calendar Service:
Set-CalendarProcessing -identity "room" -DeleteComments $false
Set-CalendarProcessing -identity "room" -DeleteSubject $false
Set-CalendarProcessing -identity "room" -AddOrganizerToSubject $false
If you want to be able to forward invitations scheduled from outside of your Microsoft organization to the device, add the following command:
Set-CalendarProcessing -identity "room|||n3hi0z8.html<<<>>>ng command:
Set-CalendarProcessing -identity "room" -ProcessExternalMeetingMessages $True
Supported device types for OBTP
The types of devices that support OBTP for Microsoft Teams meetings using the video integration and the Hybrid Calendar Service include:
Webex Board, Room, and Desk devices
Webex Room Kit and Room Phone
Cisco MX, SX, and DX series
The devices must be either registered to the Webex cloud or linked to the cloud using Edge for devices.

  If your devices are getting the Join button from Cisco TMS or Cisco TMSXE, they cannot get the Join button for Microsoft Teams meetings.
As an alternative, you can simplify joining for the affected devices by adding the SIP IVR video addres|||n3hi0z8.html<<<>>>ffected devices by adding the SIP IVR video address of the Microsoft Teams meeting as a speed dial or macro.
Features and limitations
This section explains limitations and feature behavior for the Video Integration for Microsoft Teams.
Multiple organizations and tenants
We currently support a 1:1 relationship between Webex organizations and Microsoft 365 tenants:
A single Webex organization can interoperate with only one Microsoft 365 tenant.
Your Microsoft tenant can support multiple different video integrations; for example, the tenant can simultaneously interoperate with Cisco and Poly. However, the tenant can only have one integration of each type; so, one from Cisco, and one from Poly.
|||n3hi0z8.html<<<>>>each type; so, one from Cisco, and one from Poly.
If you have multiple Webex organizations, choose one to interoperate with your Microsoft tenant using the Webex video integration.
Availability
We only support the Worldwide instance of Microsoft 365. ( Other instances which we do not support include USGovDoD, USGovGCCHigh, China, and Germany.)
We only support commercial Webex organizations in countries and regions where Webex paid subscriptions are available. (We don’t support FedRAMP-authorized Webex offerings.)
Video device interoperability
The integration only supports incoming SIP calls, not H.323 or IP calls. You can interwork these legacy protocols to SIP calls using a Cisco Expressway|||n3hi0z8.html<<<>>>cy protocols to SIP calls using a Cisco Expressway deployment.
The integration doesn't support calling into a Microsoft Teams meeting using the Webex App. In addition, the integration doesn't support features that require pairing or connecting the Webex App to a device. This includes wireless sharing, dialing from the Webex App, and call control from the Webex App.
Interactive white boarding from Webex devices is not available for meetings on Microsoft Teams. Users can share whiteboards from the device as video content (BFCP support).
The integration doesn’t support audio-only participants. (Audio-only participants should call in using the PSTN gateway functionality for Microsoft Teams.)
Lay|||n3hi0z8.html<<<>>>TN gateway functionality for Microsoft Teams.)
Layouts
Video integration participants can cycle through different layout options, by sending DTMF tones 2 and 8 from the device.
Participants can use the Cisco Touch interface to change layouts on devices that support ActiveControl. (This works with both cloud calling and SIP.)
Participants can see up to nine video streams at the same time. The number of visible streams also depends on the selected layout and the device type. Layouts show letter avatars instead of video when participants are not sending video streams to the meeting.
The integration supports single monitor + content, dual monitor + content, and TIP three monitor + content config|||n3hi0z8.html<<<>>> + content, and TIP three monitor + content configurations. Panorama-specific layouts and camera behaviors are not supported and operate like a standard dual monitor configuration. The service does not support the iX immersive experience, but those devices may connect as TIP endpoints without immersive specific features. Supported layout families may differ depending on the device type.
Dual screen devices that receive incoming participant video on two monitors will have a fixed, Focus+Grid two screen layout for VIMT calls while more than one participant monitor is active. Using the layout controls will not change the active layout while two monitors display incoming participant video. Dual |||n3hi0z8.html<<<>>>monitors display incoming participant video. Dual monitor configurations without a dedicated presentation monitor will switch to a single participant monitor while content sharing is active and layout controls will be operable for the participant monitor while content sharing is active. Three monitor configurations using a dedicated presentation monitor keep participant video on two monitors and thus remain in the fixed Focus+Grid layout regardless of content sharing.
Calendars and cross-organization invitations
Participants from outside your organization can join your Microsoft Teams meetings from their video devices by dialing your IVR video address (<yoursubdomain>@m.webex.com) and enteri|||n3hi0z8.html<<<>>>o address (<yoursubdomain>@m.webex.com) and entering the VTC conference ID for the meeting at the prompt, or by using your direct dial alternative (<VTC Conference ID>.<yoursubdomain>@m.webex.com).
The video integration for your Microsoft tenant doesn’t enable dialing into meetings hosted by other Microsoft customers. When dialing into a Teams meeting that is hosted by another Microsoft tenant, you must use the video address of the video integration that is enabled for that tenant.
Webex Hybrid Calendar Service does not create OBTP join entries for meetings containing join details supplied by other (non-Cisco) video integrations. (For example, a Hybrid Calendar enabled workspace will not sho|||n3hi0z8.html<<<>>>, a Hybrid Calendar enabled workspace will not show the One Button to Push (OBTP) Join button for a Pexip invitation.)
Known Hybrid Calendar limitations, arising from missing comments/body details or organizer-based processing, also apply when processing OBTP for Microsoft Teams meetings.
Meeting features
Video integration participants don't have controls to start or stop meeting recordings. Microsoft Teams users must manage meeting recording.
Content sharing uses BFCP and is subject to the limitations of that protocol, including no ability to share applications or allow remote control.
If meeting policies or a meeting organizer limits who can share content in a Teams meeting using the Who C|||n3hi0z8.html<<<>>>n share content in a Teams meeting using the Who Can Present? meeting option, then video integration participants must have the 'Presenter' role to share content in the meeting. When joining through the video integration, a caller is an 'attendee' by default. Callers who join as trusted callers will have the presenter role assigned automatically, regardless of the value set in Who Can Present?. Meeting organizers can toggle a participant's role on the fly using the participant list in their Teams client.
If meeting policies or a meeting organizer limits who can share content in the Teams meeting using the Who Can Present? meeting option, sharing content will not work as expected for video in|||n3hi0z8.html<<<>>>ing content will not work as expected for video integration participants who only have the 'attendee' role in the meeting. The caller will be able to start sharing on their device, but their content will not be seen by other participants in the meeting. Sharing may also interfere with receiving content from another user.
Microsoft Teams chat isn't available to video integration participants.
Microsoft Teams white boarding isn't available to video integration participants.
When Microsoft Teams participants share, only the sharing Desktop or Window options are viewable by video integration participants. Video integration participants can't view files or the PowerPoint or Whiteboard options sha|||n3hi0z8.html<<<>>> files or the PowerPoint or Whiteboard options shared from the Microsoft Teams client.
Microsoft Teams participants can mute video integration participants, but can't unmute them for privacy reasons.
Video integration participants can mute and unmute themselves either on the device (local mute) or by sending DTMF *6 (server-side mute). The participant sees a confirmation message on the device when sending *6.
In the participant list, you only see a video integration participant's mute indicator turn on if they mute themselves with *6 or if Microsoft Teams participants mute them. (Local mute doesn't update the roster.)
If the mute indicator is on, how the participant unmutes can affect the in|||n3hi0z8.html<<<>>> on, how the participant unmutes can affect the indicator differently depending on the type of calling that the device uses:
Cloud calling—The participant can unmute locally to clear the mute indicator in the participant list.
SIP or on-prem calling—Only unmuting using *6 clears the mute indicator in the roster. (Unmuting locally doesn't clear the mute indicator in the roster.)
Webex devices connecting through the video integration have the Webex IVR and splash screens localized to the language set in the device. US English is the default for all other scenarios. Localization is supported for Webex devices using cloud calling or SIP calling (requires CE9.14.3 or newer.)
Microsoft Teams lobby|||n3hi0z8.html<<<>>>requires CE9.14.3 or newer.)
Microsoft Teams lobby
Trusted devices from your own organization can streamline how they join meetings by automatically bypassing the Microsoft Teams lobby. A device is considered trusted in either of the following cases:
It is a Webex device using cloud calling, and registered to the Webex organization where you deploy the video integration.
It is a device using on-prem or SIP calling, which uses SIP TLS and presents a certificate that includes one of the verified SIP domains for the Webex organization where you deploy the video integration.

  If you enable TLS verification on your SIP calling to Webex, your TLS verification should check for the subject name si|||n3hi0z8.html<<<>>> verification should check for the subject name sip.webex.com (rather than m.webex.com).
For help with Cisco Expressway, see Configure Expressway for mutual TLS authentication
If a meeting organizer sets the Who can bypass the lobby? meeting option to 'Organizers and me' or 'People I invite', callers attempting to join as trusted callers will be placed into the lobby of the Teams meeting. The caller will see the 'Waiting for others' splash screen instead of the expected lobby splash screen.
If you disable Anonymous users can join a meeting in the Microsoft Teams tenant settings, then video integration participants cannot join through the lobby. Video integration participants who would normal|||n3hi0z8.html<<<>>>y. Video integration participants who would normally bypass the lobby will still be able to join Microsoft Teams meetings.
Networking
Calls to the video integration do not use Webex Video Mesh nodes; traffic is direct from the device to the cloud.
The specialized media clusters used by the video integration for Microsoft Teams are not part of the reachability tests that Webex-registered devices perform. Failure to open access to any of the media cluster IP ranges can lead to call failures. The integration attempts to use the optimal media cluster for each call based on where the caller originates. However, you must allow access to all media clusters because the media cluster used can vary ba|||n3hi0z8.html<<<>>>lusters because the media cluster used can vary based on run-time conditions.|||n3hi0z8.html<<<>>>January 20, 2023 |

Deploy the Webex video integration for Microsoft Teams
Overview
This integration enables your video devices to join Microsoft Teams meetings. The integration applies to Webex devices, and other SIP-capable video devices, whether they register to Webex or to your on-premises infrastructure.
Here's how the integration enhances the device user's experience when they join Microsoft Teams meetings hosted in your organization:
Webex meeting experience—multi-screen with flexible layout options
Participant list showing both Microsoft and video integration participants
Bi-directional content sharing between the device and Microso|||cy2l2z.html<<<>>>nal content sharing between the device and Microsoft Teams
Recording indicator on the device
Video device join experience, from the meeting invitation
A standard email invitation to a Microsoft Teams meeting has meeting join details that include a clickable link to join the meeting from the Microsoft Teams client. The section may also include audio dial-in information—an audio conference ID and phone numbers to join as an audio-only participant. When you enable the video integration, the invitation join details section expands to include a block of video conferencing device join details.
Figure 1: Video join details in Microsoft Teams meeting invitation
When it is time to join the meeting, v|||cy2l2z.html<<<>>> invitation
When it is time to join the meeting, video device users can call the SIP video address listed under the Join with a video conferencing device heading. The device calls the Webex interactive voice response (IVR) system, which asks the caller to provide the VTC conference ID (Video Teleconference ID). Note that the VTC Conference ID is specifically for video devices and is different from the audio conference ID, if one is included for the meeting.
The SIP IVR video address is specific to your organization and is formed from your organization's Webex SIP subdomain in the format <subdomain>@m.webex.com.
Below the SIP IVR video address and VTC Conference ID, the invitation links to a |||cy2l2z.html<<<>>> and VTC Conference ID, the invitation links to a web page of alternate dialing instructions, which shows how to join the meeting by dialing directly.
Alternative video device join method—direct dial
Video callers can join the meeting directly, bypassing the IVR, by using a SIP address in the format <VTC Conference ID>.<subdomain>@m.webex.com. This method is listed at the top of the alternate VTC dialing instructions web page that the invitation links to. The web page also repeats the IVR prompt join details from the meeting invitation.

If you also enable the |||cy2l2z.html<<<>>>ce join method—Join button
If you also enable the Webex Hybrid Calendar Service, devices can receive One Button to Push (OBTP) when schedulers invite them to Microsoft Teams meetings. An attendee using the device then simply presses the Join button when it's time to connect the device to the meeting. The meeting's entry shows the Microsoft Teams logo to indicate the type of meeting the attendee is joining.
Requirements for video integration with Microsoft Teams

You can test if the changes for an user have become active by having the user create test meetings in their Microsoft Outlook or Microsoft Teams client. If the changes have successfully propagated, you should see the video integration join details in the meeting invitation created (as shown in Overview). If the join details are not present, wait longer and repeat the test again.
What to do next

On the video interoperability card with the Microsoft Teams logo, click Edit settings.
To take full advantage of the calendar and OBTP Join features of the Hybrid Calendar Service, make sure your Webex devices are either registered to the Webex cloud or linked to the cloud using Edge for devices.
Set up Hybrid Calendar Service if you want OBTP for devices. For help setting up OBTP with the Hybrid Calendar Service on Webex video devices, see Make it easier for video devices to join meetings with OBTP.
Join button and Hybrid Calendar considerations
As mentioned in Alternative video device join method—Join |||cy2l2z.html<<<>>>oned in Alternative video device join method—Join button, if you enable the Hybrid Calendar Service, you can further enhance the calling experience for your organization using One Button to Push (OBTP).
With OBTP, Webex devices in your organization automatically show a Join button shortly before the Microsoft Teams meeting starts, when they're included in the meeting:
Personal mode devices show the button if the user associated with the device accepts the meeting invitation. (The user must be enabled for the calendar service in Control Hub.)
Shared mode devices show the button if the room mailbox email address associated with the device accepts the meeting invitation. (The device's workspace|||cy2l2z.html<<<>>>ts the meeting invitation. (The device's workspace must be enabled for the calendar service in Control Hub.)
Exchange mailbox requirements for OBTP
The Hybrid Calendar Service will only process a meeting invitation (to add the details needed for OBTP) if the meeting scheduler or at least one of the invitees has the service enabled. If your organization doesn't have many calendar service enabled users, it may be common for a device invitation to trigger the processing, rather than the scheduler or a user. When this happens, it's critical that your Exchange configuration retain all of the details that the service needs in the invitation.

  You can now enable users without Webex licenses for t|||cy2l2z.html<<<>>> can now enable users without Webex licenses for the Hybrid Calendar Service.
By default, the Exchange Online settings delete the meeting details from invitations sent to room mailboxes. Apply the following PowerShell commands to the room mailboxes of all shared mode devices that you enable for the Hybrid Calendar Service:
Set-CalendarProcessing -identity "room" -DeleteComments $false
Set-CalendarProcessing -identity "room" -DeleteSubject $false
Set-CalendarProcessing -identity "room" -AddOrganizerToSubject $false
If you want to be able to forward invitations scheduled from outside of your Microsoft organization to the device, add the following command:
Set-CalendarProcessing -identity "room|||cy2l2z.html<<<>>>ng command:
Set-CalendarProcessing -identity "room" -ProcessExternalMeetingMessages $True
Supported device types for OBTP
The types of devices that support OBTP for Microsoft Teams meetings using the video integration and the Hybrid Calendar Service include:
Webex Board, Room, and Desk devices
Webex Room Kit and Room Phone
Cisco MX, SX, and DX series
The devices must be either registered to the Webex cloud or linked to the cloud using Edge for devices.

  If your devices are getting the Join button from Cisco TMS or Cisco TMSXE, they cannot get the Join button for Microsoft Teams meetings.
As an alternative, you can simplify joining for the affected devices by adding the SIP IVR video addres|||cy2l2z.html<<<>>>ffected devices by adding the SIP IVR video address of the Microsoft Teams meeting as a speed dial or macro.
Features and limitations
This section explains limitations and feature behavior for the Video Integration for Microsoft Teams.
Multiple organizations and tenants
We currently support a 1:1 relationship between Webex organizations and Microsoft 365 tenants:
A single Webex organization can interoperate with only one Microsoft 365 tenant.
Your Microsoft tenant can support multiple different video integrations; for example, the tenant can simultaneously interoperate with Cisco and Poly. However, the tenant can only have one integration of each type; so, one from Cisco, and one from Poly.
|||cy2l2z.html<<<>>>each type; so, one from Cisco, and one from Poly.
If you have multiple Webex organizations, choose one to interoperate with your Microsoft tenant using the Webex video integration.
Availability
We only support the Worldwide instance of Microsoft 365. ( Other instances which we do not support include USGovDoD, USGovGCCHigh, China, and Germany.)
We only support commercial Webex organizations in countries and regions where Webex paid subscriptions are available. (We don’t support FedRAMP-authorized Webex offerings.)
Video device interoperability
The integration only supports incoming SIP calls, not H.323 or IP calls. You can interwork these legacy protocols to SIP calls using a Cisco Expressway|||cy2l2z.html<<<>>>cy protocols to SIP calls using a Cisco Expressway deployment.
The integration doesn't support calling into a Microsoft Teams meeting using the Webex App. In addition, the integration doesn't support features that require pairing or connecting the Webex App to a device. This includes wireless sharing, dialing from the Webex App, and call control from the Webex App.
Interactive white boarding from Webex devices is not available for meetings on Microsoft Teams. Users can share whiteboards from the device as video content (BFCP support).
The integration doesn’t support audio-only participants. (Audio-only participants should call in using the PSTN gateway functionality for Microsoft Teams.)
Lay|||cy2l2z.html<<<>>>TN gateway functionality for Microsoft Teams.)
Layouts
Video integration participants can cycle through different layout options, by sending DTMF tones 2 and 8 from the device.
Participants can use the Cisco Touch interface to change layouts on devices that support ActiveControl. (This works with both cloud calling and SIP.)
Participants can see up to nine video streams at the same time. The number of visible streams also depends on the selected layout and the device type. Layouts show letter avatars instead of video when participants are not sending video streams to the meeting.
The integration supports single monitor + content, dual monitor + content, and TIP three monitor + content config|||cy2l2z.html<<<>>> + content, and TIP three monitor + content configurations. Panorama-specific layouts and camera behaviors are not supported and operate like a standard dual monitor configuration. The service does not support the iX immersive experience, but those devices may connect as TIP endpoints without immersive specific features. Supported layout families may differ depending on the device type.
Dual screen devices that receive incoming participant video on two monitors will have a fixed, Focus+Grid two screen layout for VIMT calls while more than one participant monitor is active. Using the layout controls will not change the active layout while two monitors display incoming participant video. Dual |||cy2l2z.html<<<>>>monitors display incoming participant video. Dual monitor configurations without a dedicated presentation monitor will switch to a single participant monitor while content sharing is active and layout controls will be operable for the participant monitor while content sharing is active. Three monitor configurations using a dedicated presentation monitor keep participant video on two monitors and thus remain in the fixed Focus+Grid layout regardless of content sharing.
Calendars and cross-organization invitations
Participants from outside your organization can join your Microsoft Teams meetings from their video devices by dialing your IVR video address (<yoursubdomain>@m.webex.com) and enteri|||cy2l2z.html<<<>>>o address (<yoursubdomain>@m.webex.com) and entering the VTC conference ID for the meeting at the prompt, or by using your direct dial alternative (<VTC Conference ID>.<yoursubdomain>@m.webex.com).
The video integration for your Microsoft tenant doesn’t enable dialing into meetings hosted by other Microsoft customers. When dialing into a Teams meeting that is hosted by another Microsoft tenant, you must use the video address of the video integration that is enabled for that tenant.
Webex Hybrid Calendar Service does not create OBTP join entries for meetings containing join details supplied by other (non-Cisco) video integrations. (For example, a Hybrid Calendar enabled workspace will not sho|||cy2l2z.html<<<>>>, a Hybrid Calendar enabled workspace will not show the One Button to Push (OBTP) Join button for a Pexip invitation.)
Known Hybrid Calendar limitations, arising from missing comments/body details or organizer-based processing, also apply when processing OBTP for Microsoft Teams meetings.
Meeting features
Video integration participants don't have controls to start or stop meeting recordings. Microsoft Teams users must manage meeting recording.
Content sharing uses BFCP and is subject to the limitations of that protocol, including no ability to share applications or allow remote control.
If meeting policies or a meeting organizer limits who can share content in a Teams meeting using the Who C|||cy2l2z.html<<<>>>n share content in a Teams meeting using the Who Can Present? meeting option, then video integration participants must have the 'Presenter' role to share content in the meeting. When joining through the video integration, a caller is an 'attendee' by default. Callers who join as trusted callers will have the presenter role assigned automatically, regardless of the value set in Who Can Present?. Meeting organizers can toggle a participant's role on the fly using the participant list in their Teams client.
If meeting policies or a meeting organizer limits who can share content in the Teams meeting using the Who Can Present? meeting option, sharing content will not work as expected for video in|||cy2l2z.html<<<>>>ing content will not work as expected for video integration participants who only have the 'attendee' role in the meeting. The caller will be able to start sharing on their device, but their content will not be seen by other participants in the meeting. Sharing may also interfere with receiving content from another user.
Microsoft Teams chat isn't available to video integration participants.
Microsoft Teams white boarding isn't available to video integration participants.
When Microsoft Teams participants share, only the sharing Desktop or Window options are viewable by video integration participants. Video integration participants can't view files or the PowerPoint or Whiteboard options sha|||cy2l2z.html<<<>>> files or the PowerPoint or Whiteboard options shared from the Microsoft Teams client.
Microsoft Teams participants can mute video integration participants, but can't unmute them for privacy reasons.
Video integration participants can mute and unmute themselves either on the device (local mute) or by sending DTMF *6 (server-side mute). The participant sees a confirmation message on the device when sending *6.
In the participant list, you only see a video integration participant's mute indicator turn on if they mute themselves with *6 or if Microsoft Teams participants mute them. (Local mute doesn't update the roster.)
If the mute indicator is on, how the participant unmutes can affect the in|||cy2l2z.html<<<>>> on, how the participant unmutes can affect the indicator differently depending on the type of calling that the device uses:
Cloud calling—The participant can unmute locally to clear the mute indicator in the participant list.
SIP or on-prem calling—Only unmuting using *6 clears the mute indicator in the roster. (Unmuting locally doesn't clear the mute indicator in the roster.)
Webex devices connecting through the video integration have the Webex IVR and splash screens localized to the language set in the device. US English is the default for all other scenarios. Localization is supported for Webex devices using cloud calling or SIP calling (requires CE9.14.3 or newer.)
Microsoft Teams lobby|||cy2l2z.html<<<>>>requires CE9.14.3 or newer.)
Microsoft Teams lobby
Trusted devices from your own organization can streamline how they join meetings by automatically bypassing the Microsoft Teams lobby. A device is considered trusted in either of the following cases:
It is a Webex device using cloud calling, and registered to the Webex organization where you deploy the video integration.
It is a device using on-prem or SIP calling, which uses SIP TLS and presents a certificate that includes one of the verified SIP domains for the Webex organization where you deploy the video integration.

  If you enable TLS verification on your SIP calling to Webex, your TLS verification should check for the subject name si|||cy2l2z.html<<<>>> verification should check for the subject name sip.webex.com (rather than m.webex.com).
For help with Cisco Expressway, see Configure Expressway for mutual TLS authentication
If a meeting organizer sets the Who can bypass the lobby? meeting option to 'Organizers and me' or 'People I invite', callers attempting to join as trusted callers will be placed into the lobby of the Teams meeting. The caller will see the 'Waiting for others' splash screen instead of the expected lobby splash screen.
If you disable Anonymous users can join a meeting in the Microsoft Teams tenant settings, then video integration participants cannot join through the lobby. Video integration participants who would normal|||cy2l2z.html<<<>>>y. Video integration participants who would normally bypass the lobby will still be able to join Microsoft Teams meetings.
Networking
Calls to the video integration do not use Webex Video Mesh nodes; traffic is direct from the device to the cloud.
The specialized media clusters used by the video integration for Microsoft Teams are not part of the reachability tests that Webex-registered devices perform. Failure to open access to any of the media cluster IP ranges can lead to call failures. The integration attempts to use the optimal media cluster for each call based on where the caller originates. However, you must allow access to all media clusters because the media cluster used can vary ba|||cy2l2z.html<<<>>>lusters because the media cluster used can vary based on run-time conditions.|||cy2l2z.html<<<>>>January 20, 2023 |

Deploy the Webex video integration for Microsoft Teams
Overview
This integration enables your video devices to join Microsoft Teams meetings. The integration applies to Webex devices, and other SIP-capable video devices, whether they register to Webex or to your on-premises infrastructure.
Here's how the integration enhances the device user's experience when they join Microsoft Teams meetings hosted in your organization:
Webex meeting experience—multi-screen with flexible layout options
Participant list showing both Microsoft and video integration participants
Bi-directional content sharing between the device and Microso|||n6fwepj.html<<<>>>nal content sharing between the device and Microsoft Teams
Recording indicator on the device
Video device join experience, from the meeting invitation
A standard email invitation to a Microsoft Teams meeting has meeting join details that include a clickable link to join the meeting from the Microsoft Teams client. The section may also include audio dial-in information—an audio conference ID and phone numbers to join as an audio-only participant. When you enable the video integration, the invitation join details section expands to include a block of video conferencing device join details.
Figure 1: Video join details in Microsoft Teams meeting invitation
When it is time to join the meeting, v|||n6fwepj.html<<<>>> invitation
When it is time to join the meeting, video device users can call the SIP video address listed under the Join with a video conferencing device heading. The device calls the Webex interactive voice response (IVR) system, which asks the caller to provide the VTC conference ID (Video Teleconference ID). Note that the VTC Conference ID is specifically for video devices and is different from the audio conference ID, if one is included for the meeting.
The SIP IVR video address is specific to your organization and is formed from your organization's Webex SIP subdomain in the format <subdomain>@m.webex.com.
Below the SIP IVR video address and VTC Conference ID, the invitation links to a |||n6fwepj.html<<<>>> and VTC Conference ID, the invitation links to a web page of alternate dialing instructions, which shows how to join the meeting by dialing directly.
Alternative video device join method—direct dial
Video callers can join the meeting directly, bypassing the IVR, by using a SIP address in the format <VTC Conference ID>.<subdomain>@m.webex.com. This method is listed at the top of the alternate VTC dialing instructions web page that the invitation links to. The web page also repeats the IVR prompt join details from the meeting invitation.

If you also enable the |||n6fwepj.html<<<>>>ce join method—Join button
If you also enable the Webex Hybrid Calendar Service, devices can receive One Button to Push (OBTP) when schedulers invite them to Microsoft Teams meetings. An attendee using the device then simply presses the Join button when it's time to connect the device to the meeting. The meeting's entry shows the Microsoft Teams logo to indicate the type of meeting the attendee is joining.
Requirements for video integration with Microsoft Teams

If you do not yet have an active Webex organization, we will provision one for you when you purchase the video integration.
A Microsoft 365 tenant with Microsoft Teams accounts for users |||n6fwepj.html<<<>>>65 tenant with Microsoft Teams accounts for users in the organization
The setup process requires an account that can sign in as a Global administrator for the tenant to grant application permissions, and a Microsoft Teams administrator account for the tenant that can execute PowerShell commands.
Webex video integration licenses, one for each of the video devices that you plan to use with this integration.
The subscription for this service must be provisioned to your Webex organization in Control Hub and set up as described in this article.

  Licenses aren’t required during the Early Field Trial. To continue using the integration after the trial ends, either purchase licenses within 45 days |||n6fwepj.html<<<>>>ial ends, either purchase licenses within 45 days after the service becomes generally available or start a partner-led trial. Otherwise, the integration will stop working.
Webex devices registered to your Webex organization, or other SIP video devices that can make internet calls.
Your network call control must allow business-to-business (B2B) calling to Webex, and meet the Webex certificate requirements. For help, see How Do I Allow Webex Meetings Traffic on My Network?
Video devices must have the signaling and media network access defined in Ports and protocols for video integration traffic.

Create the video integration from Control Hub
Follow these steps to register Microsoft Teams to the Webex cloud, authorize service permissions with Microsoft, and enable Cisco video devices to join Microsoft Teams meetings. The setup wizard in https://admin.webex.com guides you through the process.
The Microsoft user has to authenticate at least two separate times during the setup. We recommend that the steps be done by a Micr|||n6fwepj.html<<<>>>tup. We recommend that the steps be done by a Microsoft administrator whose account has been given full administrator access to Control Hub.
Before you begin
Make sure that you've met all of the requirements in Requirements for video integration with Microsoft Teams.
If you haven't already done so, set up your Webex organization.
If you haven't already done so, add a subdomain for Webex SIP addresses in your organization.
In order to set up the video integration, you need the following administrator access:

Microsoft Teams administration privileges within the tenant
Full administrator privileges for your own Webex organiza|||n6fwepj.html<<<>>>ministrator privileges for your own Webex organization, and a web browser that can access Control Hub. (See System requirements for Webex services for browser compatibility.)

  Users from any other organization that may have access to your Control Hub (such as Partner Admins) do not qualify. Use a full administrator account in the Webex organization that you are configuring.
You also need access to run Microsoft PowerShell commands to complete these setup steps.
MicrosoftTeams PowerShell module installed. (Version 2.0 or newer recommended.) See " Install Microsoft Teams PowerShell" on the Microsoft Documentation web site for more information.

This includes wireless sharing, dialing from the Webex App, and call control from the Webex App.
Interactive white boarding from Webex devices is not available for meetings on Microsoft Teams. Users can share whiteboards from the device as video content (BFCP support).
The integration doesn’t support audio-only participants. (Audio-only participants should call in using the PSTN gateway functionality for Microsoft Teams.)
Lay|||n6fwepj.html<<<>>>TN gateway functionality for Microsoft Teams.)
Layouts
Video integration participants can cycle through different layout options, by sending DTMF tones 2 and 8 from the device.
Participants can use the Cisco Touch interface to change layouts on devices that support ActiveControl. (This works with both cloud calling and SIP.)
Participants can see up to nine video streams at the same time. The number of visible streams also depends on the selected layout and the device type. Layouts show letter avatars instead of video when participants are not sending video streams to the meeting.
The integration supports single monitor + content, dual monitor + content, and TIP three monitor + content config|||n6fwepj.html<<<>>> + content, and TIP three monitor + content configurations. Panorama-specific layouts and camera behaviors are not supported and operate like a standard dual monitor configuration. The service does not support the iX immersive experience, but those devices may connect as TIP endpoints without immersive specific features. Supported layout families may differ depending on the device type.
Dual screen devices that receive incoming participant video on two monitors will have a fixed, Focus+Grid two screen layout for VIMT calls while more than one participant monitor is active. Using the layout controls will not change the active layout while two monitors display incoming participant video. Dual |||n6fwepj.html<<<>>>monitors display incoming participant video. Dual monitor configurations without a dedicated presentation monitor will switch to a single participant monitor while content sharing is active and layout controls will be operable for the participant monitor while content sharing is active. Three monitor configurations using a dedicated presentation monitor keep participant video on two monitors and thus remain in the fixed Focus+Grid layout regardless of content sharing.
Calendars and cross-organization invitations
Participants from outside your organization can join your Microsoft Teams meetings from their video devices by dialing your IVR video address (<yoursubdomain>@m.webex.com) and enteri|||n6fwepj.html<<<>>>o address (<yoursubdomain>@m.webex.com) and entering the VTC conference ID for the meeting at the prompt, or by using your direct dial alternative (<VTC Conference ID>.<yoursubdomain>@m.webex.com).
The video integration for your Microsoft tenant doesn’t enable dialing into meetings hosted by other Microsoft customers. When dialing into a Teams meeting that is hosted by another Microsoft tenant, you must use the video address of the video integration that is enabled for that tenant.
Webex Hybrid Calendar Service does not create OBTP join entries for meetings containing join details supplied by other (non-Cisco) video integrations. (For example, a Hybrid Calendar enabled workspace will not sho|||n6fwepj.html<<<>>>, a Hybrid Calendar enabled workspace will not show the One Button to Push (OBTP) Join button for a Pexip invitation.)
Known Hybrid Calendar limitations, arising from missing comments/body details or organizer-based processing, also apply when processing OBTP for Microsoft Teams meetings.
Meeting features
Video integration participants don't have controls to start or stop meeting recordings. Microsoft Teams users must manage meeting recording.
Content sharing uses BFCP and is subject to the limitations of that protocol, including no ability to share applications or allow remote control.
If meeting policies or a meeting organizer limits who can share content in a Teams meeting using the Who C|||n6fwepj.html<<<>>>n share content in a Teams meeting using the Who Can Present? meeting option, then video integration participants must have the 'Presenter' role to share content in the meeting. When joining through the video integration, a caller is an 'attendee' by default. Callers who join as trusted callers will have the presenter role assigned automatically, regardless of the value set in Who Can Present?. Meeting organizers can toggle a participant's role on the fly using the participant list in their Teams client.
If meeting policies or a meeting organizer limits who can share content in the Teams meeting using the Who Can Present? meeting option, sharing content will not work as expected for video in|||n6fwepj.html<<<>>>ing content will not work as expected for video integration participants who only have the 'attendee' role in the meeting. The caller will be able to start sharing on their device, but their content will not be seen by other participants in the meeting. Sharing may also interfere with receiving content from another user.
Microsoft Teams chat isn't available to video integration participants.
Microsoft Teams white boarding isn't available to video integration participants.
When Microsoft Teams participants share, only the sharing Desktop or Window options are viewable by video integration participants. Video integration participants can't view files or the PowerPoint or Whiteboard options sha|||n6fwepj.html<<<>>> files or the PowerPoint or Whiteboard options shared from the Microsoft Teams client.
Microsoft Teams participants can mute video integration participants, but can't unmute them for privacy reasons.
Video integration participants can mute and unmute themselves either on the device (local mute) or by sending DTMF *6 (server-side mute). The participant sees a confirmation message on the device when sending *6.
In the participant list, you only see a video integration participant's mute indicator turn on if they mute themselves with *6 or if Microsoft Teams participants mute them. (Local mute doesn't update the roster.)
If the mute indicator is on, how the participant unmutes can affect the in|||n6fwepj.html<<<>>> on, how the participant unmutes can affect the indicator differently depending on the type of calling that the device uses:
Cloud calling—The participant can unmute locally to clear the mute indicator in the participant list.
SIP or on-prem calling—Only unmuting using *6 clears the mute indicator in the roster. (Unmuting locally doesn't clear the mute indicator in the roster.)
Webex devices connecting through the video integration have the Webex IVR and splash screens localized to the language set in the device. US English is the default for all other scenarios. Localization is supported for Webex devices using cloud calling or SIP calling (requires CE9.14.3 or newer.)
Microsoft Teams lobby|||n6fwepj.html<<<>>>requires CE9.14.3 or newer.)
Microsoft Teams lobby
Trusted devices from your own organization can streamline how they join meetings by automatically bypassing the Microsoft Teams lobby. A device is considered trusted in either of the following cases:
It is a Webex device using cloud calling, and registered to the Webex organization where you deploy the video integration.
It is a device using on-prem or SIP calling, which uses SIP TLS and presents a certificate that includes one of the verified SIP domains for the Webex organization where you deploy the video integration.

  If you enable TLS verification on your SIP calling to Webex, your TLS verification should check for the subject name si|||n6fwepj.html<<<>>> verification should check for the subject name sip.webex.com (rather than m.webex.com).
For help with Cisco Expressway, see Configure Expressway for mutual TLS authentication
If a meeting organizer sets the Who can bypass the lobby? meeting option to 'Organizers and me' or 'People I invite', callers attempting to join as trusted callers will be placed into the lobby of the Teams meeting. The caller will see the 'Waiting for others' splash screen instead of the expected lobby splash screen.
If you disable Anonymous users can join a meeting in the Microsoft Teams tenant settings, then video integration participants cannot join through the lobby. Video integration participants who would normal|||n6fwepj.html<<<>>>y. Video integration participants who would normally bypass the lobby will still be able to join Microsoft Teams meetings.
Networking
Calls to the video integration do not use Webex Video Mesh nodes; traffic is direct from the device to the cloud.
The specialized media clusters used by the video integration for Microsoft Teams are not part of the reachability tests that Webex-registered devices perform. Failure to open access to any of the media cluster IP ranges can lead to call failures. The integration attempts to use the optimal media cluster for each call based on where the caller originates. However, you must allow access to all media clusters because the media cluster used can vary ba|||n6fwepj.html<<<>>>lusters because the media cluster used can vary based on run-time conditions.|||n6fwepj.html<<<>>>April 16, 2020 |

Domain Verification Process for SIP Video Devices
SIP video devices within the same company can now connect to meetings without being prompted for a host PIN or key, simplifying your join experience.
With cloud-registered video devices, there is an established chain of trust and we know whether those devices belong to your organization or not. To be able to achieve the same level of security with standards-based SIP video devices, complete the steps below. These will ensure that only your own organization’s SIP video devices can join meetings without the need for PINs and keys.

Advanced scheduling options for meetings and webinars
When you’re scheduling a meeting or webinar, you can choose the basics and get them scheduled with just a few clicks. If you want to have even more control and flexibility over your meetings, use the advanced scheduling options. You can choose to let people join using different types of audio connections, change mute options, add an agenda, cohosts, breakout sessions, and more.
This article applies to Webex Meetings, Webex Webinars, and Webex App. It describes the options available when you schedule a meeting or webinar from your Webex site. When you schedule a meeting |||nroo6fs.html<<<>>>from your Webex site. When you schedule a meeting from Webex App and choose a one-time meeting link, you see a subset of these options.
Meetings
Webinars
You can access these advanced options when you schedule your meeting.
Option How to use
Cohosts
Choose from the following options:
Let me choose cohosts for this meeting
The first person to join the meeting who has a host account on this site becomes a cohost
All attendees who have host accounts on this site become cohosts when they join the meeting
Video Systems
Allow authenticated video systems in your organization to start and join the meeting.
Automatic recording
Ever forgot to record a meeting? Select this option when you're scheduling|||nroo6fs.html<<<>>>meeting? Select this option when you're scheduling a meeting so that you don't have to worry about that. Your meeting automatically records right when it starts.
Interpretation
Have more inclusive meetings by creating different language channels and assigning interpreters so that attendees can understand in their preferred language.

  Enabling interpretation disables breakout sessions.
Breakout sessions
Allow participants to break out into smaller groups during your meeting so they can collaborate and share ideas. You can preassign the number of sessions and choose whether to automatically or manually create breakout sessions.
Check out this article for more information about breakout sessi|||nroo6fs.html<<<>>> article for more information about breakout sessions.
Anonymous meeting
Choose whether to show anonymous display names for attendees instead of their original names.
Registration
Choose whether attendees must register before they can join your meeting.

  You can't use registration with recurring meetings or if you select the Join before host option. If you select these options, it disables registration for the meeting, and any previous attendee registrations get permanently deleted. To recover these attendee registrations, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center.
You can set a registration cap, automatically accept all registrations, and even customize your registration form.

  If y|||nroo6fs.html<<<>>>and even customize your registration form.

  If you have a 1000, 3000, or 5000-user plan, you can accept a maximum of 10,000 registrations. If you have a 10,000, 25,000, 50,000, or 100,000-user plan, you can accept 20% more registrations than your plan allows. For example, if you have a 10,000-user plan, you can accept a maximum of 12,000 registrations.
Although you can accept more registrations than your plan allows, only the number of attendees allowed by your plan can join your meeting. For example, if you have a 10,000-user plan, only 10,000 users can join. If you have a 1000, 3000, or 5000-user plan, only 1000, 3000, or 5000 users can join, respectively.

Customizations include creating your own questions to include in the registration for this event and your future events. You can also preview your custom registration form before you save it.
Check out this article for more information about registration.
Email reminder
We all get busy doing other things and can easily lose track of time. Send yourself a reminder before the meeting starts so you don't miss it.

  The reminder only gets sent to the meeting host.
Meeting options
You can specify what you want attendees to be able to do during a meeting. You can allow attendees to use meetings features such as posting a message to the chat window for all to see and taking note|||nroo6fs.html<<<>>> to the chat window for all to see and taking notes.
Attendee privileges
