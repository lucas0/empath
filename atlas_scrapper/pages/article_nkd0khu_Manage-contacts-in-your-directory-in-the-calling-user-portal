Manage contacts in your directory in the calling user portal
You can add contacts to a personal directory in the calling user portal. The calling user portal integrates with your desk phone and other applications, so that you can create speed dials for contacts to use when making calls.
1
Go to https://settings.webex.com and select Webex Calling.
2
From the calling user portal, click Directory.
3
Click the My Contacts tab.
4
Enter the Name and Phone Number of the contact to add.
5
(Optional) Select a Speed Dial number from the drop-down list.

  You can set up to 100 (00-99) speed dial codes for your frequently called numbers. The speed dials you create here do not sync with the speed dials you create on your IP desk phone, but they can be dialed from your desk phone.
Example

What to do next
