Webex App | Start a Personal Room meeting
If you have a Webex host license, you can meet in your Personal Room. People you invite can join the same permanent, unique Personal Room link. You can also make sure your meetings are end-to-end encrypted.

  If you subscribe to Webex App from your Service Provider, contact your Providerâ€™s customer support team if you have any questions.
Invite others to your meeting anytime by sharing a link to your Personal Room in a message. After you've started the meeting, you can also go to More options > Invite and remind, and follow the prompts.
End-to-end encryption for Webex App meetings
Personal Room meetings support end-to-end encryption. For more information on how to encrypt all your meetings by default, see Webex App | Set end-to-end encryption for meetings

Go to Meetings and then choose Start a meeting.

  If you don't see Start a meeting, it could be because:
You don't have a Webex account.
You have a Webex account but you have an attendee license and not a host license.
You have a Webex account but it's not enabled for a Personal Room.

  If your Personal Room link doesn't appear here, you need to set it up in the app first. See Set Up Your Personal Room for more information.
