Remove default buttons from the user interface on Board, Desk, and Room Series devices
You might never use a default button, like keypad or share. Having unused buttons in the user interface of a device can cause confusion. In these cases, you can remove the unused buttons.
If you don't need all the default buttons, there is a set of configurations that you can use to remove them. Custom In-Room Control panels can still be exposed. Removing default buttons and adding custom buttons makes it possible to fully customize the user interface.
For example, remove the Call and Share buttons if nobody is going to share content or call from this device. Then, add custom buttons (In-Room Controls) for the tasks that users are going to perform.
Configurations
Use the following configurations to remove default buttons from the user interface. The configurations are available from the web interface of the device and in the API. Read the Advanced Settings article for information about how to access the web interface and use the API. The web interface is also referred to as the device's Advanced Settings.
UserInterface > Features > Call > Start ( xConfiguration UserInterface Features Call Start ): Removes the default Call button (including the directory, favorites, and recent calls lists). Also removes the Add participant button while in a call.
UserInterface > Features > Call > End ( xConfiguration UserInterface Features Call End ): Removes the End Call button.
UserInterface > Features > Call > MidCallControls ( xConfiguration UserInterface Features Call MidCallControls ): Removes the Hold, Resume, and Transfer in-call buttons.

The configurations remove only the buttons, not the functionality as such. You can still share content using the Cisco Webex Teams app, even if you have removed the Share button from the user interface.
