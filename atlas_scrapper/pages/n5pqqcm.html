Sign up for face recognition and name labels
Make it easier for people in your organization to become familiar with each other. By using face recognition and name labels during meetings, you can match names with faces and help everyone connect.
During a meeting, face recognition technology is used to generate name labels. The way these labels are displayed depends on the device they are sent from. If you're using a personal device, only you will see your own name label. From shared devices:
Desk, Desk Pro, Desk Mini, and Room Kit Mini: Name labels for up to 4 people at a time are visible on the far-end throughout the meeting.
Board and Room Series: In the beginning of the meeting, you can see the name labels for the first 60 seconds of the meeting. Name labels for up to 4 people at a time are visible on the far-end. After that, the active speakers name is visible for a short while when they start speaking.
When you’re in a call or a meeting on a Board, Desk, or Room Series device that is Webex registered, your name label is visible for the receiving end. You can see the name labels of those who have signed up if you’re calling from a Board, Desk, SX, MX, or Room Series device that is Webex registered. DX70 and DX80 can only receive name labels.
Name labels are available when the camera is on, when you're in a meeting or when the self-view is on. The name lable will either show your name or your name and your title, if you have added one.
When face recognition is enabled in your organization, you receive an email to sign up, or you can sign up from https://settings.webex.com/.

Name labels are not available on transcoded conferences or on soft clients.
