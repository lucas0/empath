Host controls for raise hand on Board, Desk, and Room Series
As the host or co-host of a meeting, you can lower the hands participants have raised if they forget to do so themselves.
The host and co-host can lower hands from the participant list on the device to keep track of participants who still have questions. Only the host and co-host have these control. Lowering raised hands is available in meetings where raise hand capability is available.

Lowering raised hands isnâ€™t supported in space-backed meetings and 1:1 calls.
To lower hand from one participant access the call controls. Then open the participant list, select the person and tap Lower hand .


To lower all hands, open the participant list, select More and tap Lower all hands .
