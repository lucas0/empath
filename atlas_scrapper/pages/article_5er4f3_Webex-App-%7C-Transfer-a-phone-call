Webex App | Transfer a phone call
When you're on a phone call, you can transfer that call to someone else and if you'd like, let that person know why you're transferring the call to them.
Webex App supports different types of calls that might affect the features you can use. If you're unsure which calling service you have, see Find Out What Calling Service You Have.
