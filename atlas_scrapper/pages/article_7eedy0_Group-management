Group management
Use Control Hub to manage all aspects of your groups, including group settings, user management, and template assignments.
Groups help you to organize similar users and bulk manage user assignments, settings templates, and resources. For groups based in specific areas (such as physical office buildings and sites), we recommend using locations.
You can create and manage your Webex organization's groups by:
Using the Groups pages in Control Hub (this article)
Synchronizing security groups from Active Directory (see Directory connector deployment guide)
Using the groups API (see Webex Groups API at developer.webex.com)

  We don't synchronize Distribution groups from Active Directory. This is because Distribution groups are used for mass communications, while Security groups are used for granting permissions in AD. Webex follows that model and only uses synchronized Security groups for applying settings templates, licenses, policies, and features to multiple users.
Groups in Control Hub support a maximum of 250,000 members.
