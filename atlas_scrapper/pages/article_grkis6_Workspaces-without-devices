Workspaces without devices
You can represent all your workspaces in Control Hub and create your organization's digital twin.
Quickly and easily know which workspaces don't already have a device by filtering on workspaces that contain No devices.
You can also create a workspace without a device for workspaces that have a SIP callable device that is not Cisco managed.
You can add a device and services to the workspace at a later date.
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Management > Workspaces, and click Add Workspace.
2
Enter a name for the workspace (such as the name of the physical room). You can select room type and add capacity, but these aren't required. Then click Next.
3
Select No device and click Next.
4
You can add 3rd party SIP calling and calendar service for the workspace, but these aren't required. When you're done, click Next to complete creating a new workspace.
