Restart a Desk Phone or Analog Telephone Adapter
Restarting a device in Cisco Webex Control Hub can often help resolve any issues you may encounter. If the device is being used in an active call, the system waits for the call to end before the device is restarted.
Before you begin
Restarting a device can take some time. We recommend that you restart the device during off-peak hours, when possible. If you're attempting to resolve an issue that a user is encountering though, give the user a heads-up about the impending reboot.
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Devices, and then select the device that you want to reboot.
2
Select Reboot.
