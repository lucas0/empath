Configure Layouts for Cisco MPP Devices in Control Hub
In this article
Configure Layouts Overview
The new Configure Layouts feature adds enhanced MPP Device Management capabilities to the Webex Calling Control Hub portal.
An Administrator can customize a User’s Programmable Line Keys (PLK) on the phone and on any attached Key Expansion Modules (KEM) with the existing Configure Lines and the User’s Monitoring list feature.
On MPP devices, the layout options include setting the primary and shared line appearances (PLK Only), monitoring lines (PLK & KEM), and speed dials (PLK & KEM).
Applying Layouts in bulk (Templates) to many MPP devices is already in development and will be available later this year.
