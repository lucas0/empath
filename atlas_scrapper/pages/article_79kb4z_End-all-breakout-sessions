End all breakout sessions
As a host or cohost, you can end all breakout sessions. When you end all breakout sessions, everyone who's in a breakout session returns to the main meeting automatically.
Alternatively, you can set breakout sessions to end automatically after a specified number of minutes when you create them.
If a timer is set to count down until the breakout sessions end, the timer counts down after you end all sessions.
This feature is supported on Webex Meetings and Webex Webinars. On Webex App, this feature is available on our Video Mesh-ready meeting platform.
