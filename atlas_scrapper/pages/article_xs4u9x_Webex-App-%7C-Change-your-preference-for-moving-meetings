Webex App | Change your preference for moving meetings
When you join a meeting that you already joined on another desktop or mobile device, by default, the meeting moves to the new device and you leave the meeting on the previous device. If you prefer, change your preference to keep both devices in the meeting, or have the app prompt you each time about what you want to do.
The option you choose determines what happens each time you move a meeting to another desktop or mobile device.
