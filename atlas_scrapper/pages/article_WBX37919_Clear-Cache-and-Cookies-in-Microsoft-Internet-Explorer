Update - Extending Support for Windows 7
  With the September 2020 (40.9) update, we announced the end of support for the Windows 7 operating system. We will now continue Windows 7 support on Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge through June 2021. Cisco will continue to provide bug fixes and updates for Windows 7 wherever possible.
For Windows 7 customers who use Internet Explorer, Cisco will support Internet Explorer 11 until Microsoft declares its end of life. To have the best meeting experience possible, plan to upgrade your operating system and browser to the latest versions.  See following: Find Your Cisco Webex Meetings Version Number.
