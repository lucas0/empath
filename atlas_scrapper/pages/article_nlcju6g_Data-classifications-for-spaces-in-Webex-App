Data classifications for spaces in Webex App
By adding classification labels to your spaces, you can help users follow your organization's information policies.
Space Classification is part of Pro Pack for Control Hub. For more information, see Pro Pack For Cisco Webex Control Hub.
Space classifications are labels that remind users what they can and can't talk about or share in a space. When a space is classified, a classification label—for example, Public or Company Sensitive—appears in the message area.
You can add, arrange, and edit space classifications to match your organization's information policies. Users decide which classification to use when they create new spaces.
