Webex App | Site survivability
Webex Calling site survivability is a backup mechanism to provide basic calling support. If a site in your company loses internet connectivity and youâ€™re at that site, you can still make and receive calls, both internally in your company and externally to customers.
Site survivability requires a survivability gateway that your administrator must configure. For more information, see Site Survivability for Webex Calling
