Preassign participants to breakout sessions
As a host or cohost, if you already know how you want to split up your participants, you can create the breakout sessions ahead of time when you schedule the meeting using the scheduler on your Webex site.
This feature is supported on Webex Meetings and Webex Webinars. On Webex App, this feature is available on our Video Mesh-ready meeting platform.
You can preassign people to breakout sessions either by using your attendee or panelist list or by importing a CSV file:
If you use the attendee list for meetings or panelist list for webinars, you can assign people manually or automatically. You can assign attendees to webinars manually.
Any cohosts on your list don't get assigned automatically to breakout sessions.
If you import a CSV file, you can download a template, and then enter the names of the breakout sessions and the email addresses of the people that you want to preassign. These people get invited to the meeting.
You can assign, move, or remove participants during the meeting, if you need to make adjustments after the meeting has started.

  You can't assign attendees to breakout session during a webinar. Once breakout sessions have started, attendees can choose which breakout session they want to join.
