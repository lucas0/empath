Enhanced Survivability Prerequisites
The Configuration for Enhanced Survivability for Webex Calling Dedicated Instance is described based on DNS, Firewall, Proxy and DNS settings.
Consider the following key specifications for an Enhanced Survivability Node before deploying:
In a single Unified CM cluster, you can deploy, Maximum of only 8 Enhanced Survivability Nodes
The round-trip time (RTT) between the Unified CM cluster in Dedicated Instance and the enhanced survivability node must be equal or less than 200 milliseconds.
A maximum of 7500 devices is registered on the Enhanced Survivability Node during the Survivability event.
The feature supports only on Edge or Partner Connect, cloud connectivity options.
Deploy the PSTN Local Gateway in the site for the PSTN routing of intersite, intercluster, Emergency, and PSTN calls.
On-net calling is possible only between devices that are registered to the same ESN and for other calls it must be routed through the PSTN Local Gateway.
The Enhanced Survivability Node is added only as the tertiary node in the Unified CM Call manager group. Hence, you must make sure the integrations and devices/clients support the tertiary TFTP or ESN IP configurable in the application.
Firewall Configuration
The Customer’s Firewall should allow the mentioned ports for the Enhanced Survivability Node to reach the publisher deployed in the Dedicated Instance data center.
Ports to be allowed in the Firewall
The Customer’s Firewall must allow the below mentioned ports, for the Enhanced Survivability Node to reach the publisher deployed in the Dedicated Instance data center.
*ESN: Enhanced Survivability Node.

IPs to be Allowed in the Firewall
The below-mentioned IP address needs to be added to the Customer’s firewall for the Enhanced Survivability Nodes to communicate with the monitoring tools deployed in Dedicated Instance.
Dedicated Instance Region Subnet
U.S. 69.168.17.0/24
EMEA 178.215.138.0/24
EU 178.215.131.0/24
APJC 103.232.71.0/24
AUS 178.215.128.0/24
DNS Requirements
You need to configure conditional forwarders in the DNS server and for more information refer,DNS Requirements.
Proxy Settings
Enhanced Survivability node has a module which needs to register to the Cisco's telemetry cloud. This requires the node to reach the cloud over the Internet. For the same, there can be a proxy servers used or not. There are three different options to configure the Enhanced Survivability Node to reach the Cisco Cloud:
If you do not have a proxy to reach Internet, then the Enhanced Survivability Node can reach the Cisco Cloud directly without any proxy server
You configure the proxy server settings in the Enhanced Survivability Node.
You provide the proxy server details in the Control Hub Enhanced Survivability activation form, and we configure the proxy server details in the Enhanced Survivability Node during the activation.
If a proxy server is present in the customer’s site, then the below mentioned URLs need to be allowed in the Firewall > Proxy server and firewall.
URLs Purpose
*.ucmgmt.cisco.com Control Hub
*.webex.com Telemetry
Unified CM Version
Enhanced Survivability feature supports only from Unified CM version v14SU3 and later. The Enhanced Survivability Node must be the same version as the Dedicated Instance Unified CM version. We provide the link to the bootable ISO of Unified CM of a major release and if the Dedicated Instance Unified CM publisher is in a greater version, you first need to install the bootable and upgrade to the target DI Unified CM cluster version. You get the link for the bootable through email to the email address mentioned in the “End Customer Email” in CCW. For more information refer, How to Order section.
Virtualization Specification
The following are the OVA specifications for the Enhanced Survivability Node:
Supported Versions of VMware vSphere ESXi= 6.7, 7.0 U1
Application OVA Size Virtual Machine Configuration Requirements
vCPU Physical CPU Base Frequency vRAM vDisk vNIC
Enhanced Survivability Node Medium 2 2.50+ GHz 8 GB 1 x 110 GB 1 (1GbE+)
Local Push Notification Service (LPNS) Settings
You need to enable LPNS in Dedicated Instance Unified CM cluster, for your Webex App/Jabber clients running on Apple ios devices to receive notifications during survivability event. For more information, refer Push Notifications (On-Premises Deployments).
Local PSTN Gateway
Deploy the Local PSTN gateway in every survivability site, as during the survivability event the Local PSTN Gateway is used for intercluster, intersite, emergency, and PSTN calls from the Enhanced Survivability Node. If there is a central PSTN gateway and a local PSTN gateway only for survivability, a separate SIP trunk needs to be configured from the ESN to the local PSTN gateway, along with the required dial plan changes for routing the calls to Local Gateway during the survivability event.

For more information on call routing, refer Call Routing.
Supported Devices
All Cisco phone model that are supported by the Cisco Call Manager can failover and register to the Enhanced Survivability Node. But only 78XX/88XX Phones while registering to the Enhanced Survivability Node displays “Service Interruption. Few Features may not be available”.

Enhanced Survivability feature supports Webex App 43.6 version and above.
