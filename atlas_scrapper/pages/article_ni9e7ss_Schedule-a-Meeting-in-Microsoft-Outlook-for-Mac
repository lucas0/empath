Schedule a Meeting in Microsoft Outlook for Mac
In this article
Schedule, edit, or cancel meetings from Microsoft Outlook using Cisco Webex Productivity Tools on your Mac. Learn the prerequisites for scheduling a meeting and discover the various types of meetings that you can schedule.
End of Support for Mac Productivity Tools
The final release for Productivity Tools for Mac will be 41.5 as Microsoft plans to block injection-based plugins on Mac Outlook beginning in mid-May. Mac based Outlook customers who wish to use Webex should move to the Cisco Webex Scheduler.
Webex Productivity Tools is a separate package from the Webex Meetings desktop app from 39.10. Productivity Tools no longer supports integrations with IBM Lotus Notes, IBM Sametime, Microsoft Lync, Internet Explorer, and Skype for Business from 41.2.
Schedule a Meeting Prerequisites
You can schedule Webex meetings or appointments using the Webex Productivity Tools integration to Microsoft Outlook, and the process is very similar for both.
Please be aware of the following:
Not all the features available for scheduling meetings on your Webex site are available in Productivity Tools. This includes some of the recurrence patterns. For more info see Recurrence Pattern Limitation for the Webex Integration to Outlook.
If you schedule meetings from Outlook, then the meeting time zone will match the one on your computer, which might be different from the time zone set on your Webex site.
Schedule a Webex Meeting
1
From the Home ribbon in Microsoft Outlook go to Cisco Webex and click Schedule Webex Meeting.
2
Click To and select who you would like to invite to the meeting.
3
Add a Subject and a Location.
To add advanced meetings features like cohosts or breakout sessions for WBS40.9 and later sites, click Change Settings.
4
Click Send.
To remove a Webex meeting without cancelling the meeting, first open the meeting and click Cancel Webex or Cancel Personal Room. Then send the update.
Schedule a Personal Conference or Audio-Only Meeting
1
From the Home ribbon in Microsoft Outlook, go to Cisco Webex and click Schedule Personal Conference or Audio-Only Meeting.
2
Click To and select who you would like to invite to the meeting.
3
Add a Location, and then click Send.
Schedule a Personal Room Meeting
Personal rooms are your own virtual conference room. It’s always available and you don’t have to book it. When you schedule a Personal Room meeting, the meeting takes place in your Personal Room, and the link to join the meeting is your Personal Room URL.
1
From the Home ribbon in Microsoft Outlook, go to Cisco Webex and click Schedule Personal Room Meeting.
2
Click To and select who you would like to invite to the meeting.
3
Add a Location, and then Click Send.
Edit a Scheduled Meeting
Once you schedule a meeting using Webex integration to Outlook, you can use Outlook to edit it at any time. For example, you can change its start time, specify a new password, choose a different audio connection option, and so on.
Once you edit a scheduled meeting, integration to Outlook sends an updated meeting invitation to the attendees whom you invited to the meeting and also updates the meeting information on your Webex site.

If you reschedule a single occurrence of a recurring Webex meeting using Microsoft Outlook, the changes will also show on your Webex site.
1
On your Microsoft Outlook calendar, open the item for the scheduled meeting.
2
You can change any of the following:
To change Webex meeting settings, select Change Settings.
To add or change a recurrence pattern, select Recurrence.
To edit the text in the meeting invitation email message, do it on the Appointment window.
3
Do one of the following, as appropriate:
To send the updated meeting invitation to invited attendees and save the updated meeting in your Outlook calendar, select Send Update.
To save the updated meeting to your Outlook calendar, select Save and Close.
Cancel a Scheduled Meeting
If you schedule a meeting using the integration to Outlook, you can cancel the meeting in Outlook.
You can use the Cancel Webex Meeting, Cancel Personal Room, or Cancel Personal Conference button from the Webex toolbar in Outlook to cancel and remove the Webex information from the Outlook meeting or appointment. You may want to do this if you are changing the type of Webex meeting; for example, if you originally scheduled a Webex meeting and want to change it to a Personal Room meeting.

If you cancel a Webex meeting using your Webex site, your changes will not show in Microsoft Outlook. For example, if you cancel the meeting using your site, the meeting does not cancel on your Outlook calendar. Therefore, we recommend that you use only Outlook to cancel a meeting. Editing a meeting using your Webex site that was scheduled using Outlook is not an option.
If you cancel a single occurrence of a recurring Webex meeting using Microsoft Outlook, the changes will also show on your Webex site.
If you save the meeting or appointment after using one of these canceling buttons and you have not added another Webex meeting, Personal Room meeting, or Personal Conference meeting, it becomes a regular Microsoft Outlook meeting with no Webex information.
You can also cancel a meeting from the Microsoft Outlook calendar as described below.
1
On your Microsoft Outlook calendar, open the item for the scheduled meeting.
2
Select Cancel.
3
Select Yes in the confirmation message.
4
Select Send Cancellation.
