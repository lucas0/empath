Embedded apps in Webex
Bring the web apps your users already use into Webex. Your users can use embedded apps directly in a Webex meeting or space.
In Control Hub, you can enable public apps or your own private embedded apps. Your users access the apps directly in their Webex meetings and spaces.
Through the Webex Developer Portal, you create your own apps and register them for use with Webex. See the Embedded Apps paper for details.
There are public and private embedded apps. We have approved public apps for use by everyone. You can add private apps and enable them just for your organization.

  Webex for Government only supports private embedded apps. Use https://developer-usgov.webex.com instead of the commercial Webex Developer Portal.
Allow or block public apps
Approve or deny a private app

Configure groups in the app
Configure PII in the app
You can allow or block specific embedded apps for your organization through Control Hub.

  Webex for Government doesn't support public embedded apps.
