Allow Bring your own device (BYOD) in Control Hub
You can enhance security by locking corporate devices so that users must authenticate to join or host meetings. You can achieve this by configuring a token ID on your company's corporate devices. By default, BYOD is turned on. If you turn BYOD off, then users won't be able to join or host meetings on devices without a token ID.
The BYOD setting is turned on by default. This allows any user in your organization to join and host meetings with their personal devices. If you don't want users in your organization to join and host meetings with their personal devices, then you need to make sure that a token ID is installed on all your trusted corporate devices before turning BYOD off.
If the BYOD setting is turned off without the token ID authorization installed on corporate devices, then signed-in users of your organization will be blocked from joining and hosting meetings on corporate and personal devices. Make sure that the token is installed on all corporate devices first before you turn BYOD off.
This setting is available on Webex Meetings and Webex App (meetings on the Video Mesh-ready meeting platform).
