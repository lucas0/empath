Use Webex Assistant in Webex Meetings and Webex Webinars
Webex Assistant for meetings and webinars is an intelligent, interactive virtual assistant that makes meetings and webinars searchable, actionable, and more productive. You can ask Webex Assistant to follow up on action items, take note of important decisions, and highlight key moments during a meeting or webinar.
Webex Assistant is available in meetings and webinars. For 41.7 or later sites, it is also available in the Webex App.

  Webex Assistant is not supported for webinars in webcast view, Webex for Government, or for meetings started or joined from a space in the Webex App.
Webex Assistant requires Cisco Webex video platform version 2.0 with joining meetings from video systems enabled. To find out which version youâ€™re using, see Find your Webex Meetings version number.
