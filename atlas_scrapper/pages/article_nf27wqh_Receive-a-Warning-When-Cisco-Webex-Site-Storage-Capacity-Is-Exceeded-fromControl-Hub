Receive a Warning When Cisco Webex Site Storage Capacity Is Exceeded from Control Hub
You can configure your Webex site to send you a warning message when the storage space for your Webex recordings is running out.
Your Webex site provides a limited amount of storage space for user recording files in the My Files area of My Webex. When the capacity for your site is exceeded, users cannot store more files on the site. You can set this option so that you receive a warning message about the storage capacity, the next time that you sign in to Control Hub.

Under Meeting, select Sites, choose your site, and then select Configure Site.
3
Select Site Options, then locate Notify site administrator if storage usage exceeds __% of total allocated space.
4
Specify the percentage of total allocated space at which you want to receive a warning message.

Select Update.
