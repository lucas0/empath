Webex Calling Data Center in the European Union
The unified Webex, fully redundant data center pair in the European Union (EU) supports all Webex workloads including Webex Calling. It is primarily aimed at our EU based customers but also available to EMEA customers.
Benefits of the EU Webex unified data center:
Designed to provide EU data sovereignty to customers who want it.
Customers hosted in the EU data center for all Webex workloads, will have data that resides in that data center pair in the EU.

Pre-Brexit, Webex Calling has offered hosting in the EU through a data center pair that resides in part in the UK and in part in the EU. That data center pair remains state-of-the-art, continues to serve the customers that are hosted in it, and is available to new customers.
