Answer calls for your coworkers
This Help article is for Cisco Video Phone 8875 registered to Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM).
If you share call handling responsibilities with your coworkers, the call pickup feature allows you to answer a call that is ringing on their phones. You can answer calls for your coworkers within or out of your call pickup group.
When there's an incoming call on your coworkers' phone, you can see a notification on your phone. The notification remains visible for 10 seconds. Even if the notification disappears, you can still answer the call as long as it's still waiting to be answered.
To use this feature, your administrator must add your directory number to at least one call pickup group.
Answer a call for your coworkers within your group (Pickup)

Use BLF with speed dial and call pickup
Compared to the speed-dial buttons found on your phone's Speed Dials tab, BLF shortcuts with speed dial not only allow you to quickly dial the number but also enable you to monitor the status of your coworker's line. If the shortcut is also configured with the Call Pickup feature, you're able to answer calls for your coworkers when they're unavailable.
The following table lists the status indicators for BLF with speed dial.
