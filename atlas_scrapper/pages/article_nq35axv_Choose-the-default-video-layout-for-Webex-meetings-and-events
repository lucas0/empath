Choose the default video layout for Webex meetings and events
As a Webex administrator, you can choose the default layout for meetings and events when no content is being shared.
Hosts and participants can change the video layout any time during the meeting or event.
Grid view is ideal for collaboration because participants can see up to 25 participants at the same time. Up to 6 of the 25 video streams can originate from video systems. Grid view is the default layout for Webex Meetings, when content isn't shared. When content is shared, the default view is Stage view.
