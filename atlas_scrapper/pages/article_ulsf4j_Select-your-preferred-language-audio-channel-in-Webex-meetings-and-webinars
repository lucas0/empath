Select your preferred language audio channel in Webex meetings and webinars
If a meeting or webinar that you join has language interpreters, you have the option to choose the audio channel for your preferred language so that you can better understand what's happening. The available languages depends on what the host of the meeting or webinar assigns.
Webex App supports simultaneous interpretation in meetings with up to 200 participants and devices. This limit doesn't apply to participants who join from Webex Meetings.
This feature is available for virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) environments for Webex App only.

If the original audio is in the same language as your preferred interpretation language and the interpreter stops speaking, after a few seconds, you hear the original audio.
