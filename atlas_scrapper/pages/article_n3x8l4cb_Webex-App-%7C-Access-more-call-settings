Click your profile picture and then go to Settings > Calling.
2
Scroll to Additional Call Settings and choose one of the following, depending on your setup:
Advanced Call Settings—This link takes you to some more call settings, such as voicemail and more call forwarding options.
Access User Portal—You also see this option if you're set up with Webex Calling or if your service provider has enabled this option for you. Here, you have access to a few more settings that aren't available from the Advanced Call Settings link. For example, voicemail PIN reset, scheduling for certain features (selective call forwarding, call rejection, and so on), and Executive Assistant settings.
