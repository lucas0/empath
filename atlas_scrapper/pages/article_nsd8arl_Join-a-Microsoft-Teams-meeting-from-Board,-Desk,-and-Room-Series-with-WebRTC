Join a Microsoft Teams meeting from Board, Desk, and Room Series with WebRTC
When you're invited to a Microsoft Teams meeting, you can join the meeting directly from the Webex app or from a device with One Button to Push (OBTP).
When users schedule Microsoft Teams meetings and include Cisco devices, a join button appears on the devices right before the meeting begins.

WebRTC is available on devices that support the web engine.
WebRTC isn't supported:
In classroom setup
On Panorama
With the SpeakerTrack 60 when SpeakerTrack is enabled

These features aren't available during the meeting:
Sharing wirelessly or with an HDMI
Whiteboarding
Far end camera control
Participant list
Devices with dual screens show the meeting on the main display
To join a Microsoft Teams meeting on your device:
Before the meeting starts, your device or Touch controller displays the Join button. Tap it to enter the meeting.


The call controls and the self-view fade away after a few seconds. When a presentation is shared, the Webex device displays the presentation from Microsoft Teams. However, the content shared on screen is not interactive.
On dual screen Room Series devices, the second screen isnâ€™t used.
