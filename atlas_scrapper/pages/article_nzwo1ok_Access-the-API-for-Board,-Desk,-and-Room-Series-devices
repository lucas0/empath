Access the API for Board, Desk, and Room Series devices
You can use the device's API to configure your devices, build integrations, and create extensions.
In order to program against the device, there must be a local user on the device. Read more about creating local users in the Local User Administration article.
There are several ways to access the API. Regardless of which method you choose, the structure of the API is the same. Choose the connection method that suits your application best:
SSH (Secure TCP/IP connection. Enabled by default).
Telnet (Available only for devices in the DX, MX, and SX series. Disabled by default).
HTTP/HTTPS (HTTPS enabled by default).
Serial connection (Can be used without an IP address, DNS, or a network. Enabled by default).

The API commands for all products and the syntax and semantics are described in this guide.
Commands that are not applicable when a device is registered to Cisco Webex
Some of the configurations, commands, and statuses that are available in the API only apply to on-premises registered devices. They don’t apply to Webex registered devices. In the API guide's Supported Commands Matrix, these items are marked with “On-prem only”.
Among the non-applicable configurations, commands and statuses, are all those related to H.323, H.320, SIP, NTP, CUCM, LDAP, Proximity, and Far End Camera Control.
The nonapplicable configurations and statuses will be removed from the Webex registered devices in a later software release. We recommend you not to program against API commands in these categories.
