Room Navigator as a standalone device
Room Navigators can be used as a stand-alone device in rooms not equipped with a video conferencing device. This provides a consistent experience for all rooms with or without a device.
You can register a Room Navigator directly to Control Hub and manage it as a stand-alone device. Room Navigator as a stand-alone device supports third-party party web apps, room booking, and xAPIs for third-party integrations.
Persistent web app mode
Running a third-party web application on a Room Navigator lets you integrate your company's custom solution for managing room bookings and communicating workplace guidelines and information.
The app that you select displays on the Room Navigator’s entire screen, replacing the RoomOS user interface, and it can’t be dismissed by end-users.
Room booking mode
The Room Navigator for wall mounting can be configured as a room booking device. It displays the room availability status and users can schedule instant meetings or see the room calendar.
Room booking app on a stand-alone device provides the same experience and functionality as a paired Room Navigator except for the sensor data and people count.
Set office hours
We recommend that you set office hours for your Room Navigator when it's in persistent web app mode. Office hours protect the screen from potential burn out due to over-usage. Read more about setting office hours.
