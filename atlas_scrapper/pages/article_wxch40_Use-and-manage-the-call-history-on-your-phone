Call history on your phone
Use the Recents list to retrieve your recent calls and check your voice messages. The Recents list contains the calls that you placed, received, missed on the phone.
You can access the Recents list by tapping Recents on the phone home screen. If you have missed calls or unread voice messages, a digit on the button shows the total number of them. After you access the Recents lists on a specific line, you can see the number of the unread voice messages, for example, .
The calls are sorted into the following types:
All: Lists all the recent calls.
Placed: Lists the outgoing calls that you placed.
Received: Lists the incoming calls that you answered.
Missed: Lists the missed calls
The All Recents list can store a maximum number of 180 calls. The Placed, Received, Missed Recents list can store a maximum number of 60 calls respectively. If a Recents list reaches the maximum size, the next new entry overwrites the oldest entry in the list.
If you have recent calls for your hunt group, then the All Recents list includes the term Hunt group followed by the hunt group number or name. Therefore, you can quickly identify the hunt group calls from recent calls.
