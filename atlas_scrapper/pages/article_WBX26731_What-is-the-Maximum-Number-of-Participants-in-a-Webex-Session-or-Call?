What is the Maximum Number of Participants in a Webex Session or Call?
The In-meeting participant and meeting audio capacity will vary depending on which service you are using.
What is the maximum number of participants in a Webex session or call?
How many participants can receive video in a Webex Event (Classic)?
What is the minimum number of participants in a Cisco Webex Video call?
How many participants can join an event using a video device?
What is the capacity to receive video in a Webex Webinars (formerly Webex Events (New)?
 Notes:
If the session type in Site Admin has a number after the session (Example: Webex Meetings 25), then the number indicates the attendee capacity. If this number is exceeded, either additional participants may not be allowed to attend the meeting or overage charges will apply.
When the participant audio capacity has been reached, attendees will hear the following error when joining the teleconference: 'System error 4004: The conference you are attempting to join is full.'
If an attendee does not use the attendee ID to join the audio conference of a Webex meeting, the attendee will be counted as two participants.
If a meeting scheduled as an audio only conference is escalated to an online Webex meeting, the number of participants can join the online meeting is limited to 25. For details, see: WBX79050 - Error: Meeting you are trying to join is limited to 25 participants and no more participants can join the meeting'

Solution:
Your Webex site may be configured to allow fewer attendees than the maximum capacities listed in this article. Your Webex site may or may not be configured to allow attendee overage.
Overage charges vary depending on which service model you are on. The actual amount of Users/Ports available to you will be based on your original service agreement.
The maximum numbers of participants in each service are as follows:
*Participant includes the host, presenters, and panelists.

In- meeting video device:
Video Device Capacity
Service Video Platform 1 Video Platform 2
Webex Meetings 25 200
Webex Events (Classic) NA 200 (Host / Presenter / Panelist only)
Webex Webinars (formerly Webex Events (New) NA 200 (Host / Presenter / Panelist only)
Webex Events (New) Webcast Mode NA 200 (Host / Presenter / Panelist only)
Note:
Video device capacity counts towards the in-meeting participant cap. For example, if your Webex Meetings site is configured to allow 1,000 participants and 200 video devices to join, 800 participants will be able to join via PC/Mobile/Teleconference.
In Webex versions 41.3 and earlier sites, only the first 1000 Event participants can receive participant video. (Example: when turning on a webcam (or a video device) as a panelist, only the first 1000 participants can view it.). This applies to Cisco Webex Events that have up to 3000 participants. This condition does not apply to Webex Webinars (formerly Webex Events (New)) Webex versions 41.4 and older releases as the 1000 participants limit has been removed.
Grid view is limited to showing a maximum of 6 simultaneous endpoint video streams and a total of 25 video streams. This limitation only applies to Video Platform 1.
Audio:

Note: * Beginning with Webex version 39.6, Cisco Webex Meetings, Webex Events, and Webex Training support up to a maximum of 1000 Webex Teleconference participants.
