Search for and delete meetings and webinars using Control Hub
There are times when administrators need to delete scheduled meetings and webinars, such as if the host leaves the organization. If you're an administrator, you can search for and delete obsolete meetings and webinars. You can search by the entire meeting or webinar number, or all or part of the host's email address. You can search all sites or filter by site.
1
Sign in to Control Hub, then under Services, select Meeting.
2
On the Meetings page, select Manage Meetings and Webinars.
3
To search for meetings and webinars, enter the entire meeting or webinar number, or enter all or part of the host's email address.
You can filter your search results by site.
4
In the search results, check the corresponding check box for each meeting or webinar that you want to delete, then click Delete.
5
In the confirmation dialog box, click Delete. This is permanent and cannot be undone.
What to do next
Deleted meetings and webinars are not automatically removed from users' calendars. Once users receive an email notification that the meeting or webinar has been cancelled, they can remove it from their calendar.
