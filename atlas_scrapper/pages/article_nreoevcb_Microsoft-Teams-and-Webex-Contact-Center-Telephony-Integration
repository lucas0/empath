Microsoft Teams and Webex Contact Center Telephony Integration
Webex Contact Center Telephony integration for Microsoft Teams combines Contact Center capabilities with the Microsoft phone system. This integration ensures quick collaboration between Contact Center agents and your organization.
The key features of this integration are:
Routing of skill-based inbound calls from the Microsoft phone system to Contact Center agents.
Support for both Microsoft PSTN and third-party direct routing providers.
Call handling for agents directly from the Microsoft Teams interface.
Many enterprises use Microsoft Teams as the platform for delivering messages, conducting meetings, and managing collaboration workloads in their organizations.
Agents now have the ability to receive voice interactions in Webex Contact Center that are delivered through the Microsoft phone system. After receiving calls, agents can conference and transfer voice contacts from the Agent Desktop to other users registered on the Microsoft phone system.
If you use the Microsoft phone system, you have the option of connecting to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) using a certified Session Border Controller (SBC), such as the Cisco Unified Border Element (CUBE). For more information, see:
