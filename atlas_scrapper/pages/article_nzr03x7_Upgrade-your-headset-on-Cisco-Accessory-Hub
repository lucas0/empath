Upgrade your headset on Cisco Accessory Hub
You can upgrade your Cisco Headset 500 Series, Cisco Headset 730, or Cisco Headset USB HD Adapter on Cisco Accessory Hub.
Cisco Accessory Hub enables you to upgrade and check your headset firmware through your web browser. It automatically checks your headset firmware and gives you the option to upgrade your headset when there's newer firmware available.
You can upgrade the following headsets on Accessory Hub:
Cisco Headset 320 Series
Cisco Headset 520 and 530 Series
Cisco Headset 560 Series
Cisco Headset 730
Bang & Olufsen Cisco 980
Cisco Headset USB HD Adapter
You can also upload an older firmware version from your PC desktop. Download the zipped firmware files from the Cisco Software Download page and extract the .ptc firmware files. Headset models match to each .ptc file by name. Use the following table as a guide:

  You can only upgrade to new firmware versions from firmware version 2.3(1) or later. You can downgrade from 2.3(1), but Cisco Accessory Hub won't be able to detect your headset after it downgrades to the older firmware.
