Hide Meeting Links from Attendees Within Meetings on Your Webex Site
As a site administrator, you decide whether the meeting and event links are available to attendees from within meetings on your Webex site. Hiding the links within meetings deters attendees from inviting unwanted guests by making the links less convenient to copy and share. It does not prevent attendees from copying and sharing meeting links from their email invitations.
Site Administration
Control Hub
1
Sign into Webex Administration, and go to Configuration > Common Site Settings > Options.
2
Scroll down to Security Options > Other and check Hide meeting link from attendee view within meetings (Meetings and Events). This option is unchecked by default.

  When hidden, the Copy Meeting Link option is disabled for attendees in the Meeting Info window, the More Options menu, and the Meeting menu. Hosts can still share meeting links within meetings.
