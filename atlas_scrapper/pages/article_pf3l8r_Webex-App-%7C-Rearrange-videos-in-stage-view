Webex App | Rearrange videos in stage view
Reposition the videos in stage view and decide the order in which they appear. When you move someone's video to a new location, the other videos move one position to the right of the video that you moved. When you move a video to the end of a row, the other video moves to the following row.
You can rearrange videos in stage view only if hosts haven't prevented you from changing your video layout by locking the attendee view on stage only.

Before you begin
Switch to stack or side by side layout. Stage view isn't available in grid layout.
After you move participants to the stage, drag the video you want to a new position.

  To give someone a more prominent position in the stage, move their video to the upper left corner. Hover over the participantâ€™s video and click More options > Move to first position.
