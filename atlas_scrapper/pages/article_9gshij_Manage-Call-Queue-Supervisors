Manage Call Queue Supervisors
Supervisors are users who manage call queue agents. You can add, delete, assign, or unassign a supervisor.
Agents in a call queue can be associated with a supervisor who can silently monitor, coach, barge in or to take over calls that their assigned agents are currently handling.
Call queue supervisor functions for Webex Calling
Silent monitoring—Monitor an agent’s call without the agent or the caller knowing. Use this feature to make sure training is working or identify where agents need to improve.
To silently monitor a call, enter #82 plus the agent’s extension or phone number.
Coaching—Patch into an agent’s call and communicate with the agent. The agent is the only one who can hear you. Use this feature for training new employees.
To coach a call, enter #85 plus the agent’s extension or phone number.
Barge-in—Drop in on an agent’s call. Both the agent and the caller can hear you. This feature is useful when you need to participate in the call and help resolve issues.
To barge-in on a call, enter *33 plus the agent’s extension or phone number.
Take Over—Pull a call from an agent. Use this feature when you need to completely take over the call for an agent.
To take over a call, enter #86 plus the agent’s extension or phone number.

While invoking Supervisor functions, a warning tone is played to an agent while he monitors, coaches or barges in and an announcement is played for the takeover function.
