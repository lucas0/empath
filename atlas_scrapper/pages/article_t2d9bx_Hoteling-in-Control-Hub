Hoteling in Control Hub
As an administrator, you can enable hoteling for users so that their phone profile (phone number, features, and calling plan) is temporarily loaded onto a shared (host) phone. Hoteling is useful if you have flexible workspaces (no assigned seating), employees who travel a lot, or a call center environment.
You can designate specific phones (hosts) that users (guests) can temporarily sign in to and use as their own phone.

Workspace phones and user phones can be enabled as a hoteling host phone.

If a user is set up with shared lines, speed dials, and/or monitoring keys like BLF and call park, these donâ€™t appear on a host phone when the user is signed in as a guest. Host phones can have shared lines configured, which are then available to all hoteling users.
