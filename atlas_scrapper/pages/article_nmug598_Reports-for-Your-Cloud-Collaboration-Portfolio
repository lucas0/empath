Reports for Your Cloud Collaboration Portfolio
Reports help you track and analyze the performance of Webex services in your organization. You can use these reports to see details for each meeting, how often users are messaging each other, details for Webex Calling calls and call queues, how often Cisco devices are used, onboarding information, and more.

Reports, along with Analytics and Troubleshooting, is one part under the Monitoring section available in Control Hub that you can use to help track usage or solve issues with Webex services in your organization.
You can choose to generate a CSV-formatted report immediately or to schedule reports to run automatically in a daily, weekly, or monthly format. When you download a report, the report uses the following naming format for the file:
Default report template—Default Template Name_alphanumeric characters_Download Date
Custom report template—Custom Template Name_alphanumeric characters_Download Date
To generate these reports with an API, see the Reports API or Report Templates API developer page. You must have Pro Pack in order to generate reports with an API.

  UI tooltips are shown for features that are only available with Pro Pack.
The table below shows you what types of reports are are available for Control Hub, the earliest date range that you can view the data for each report, and the maximum date range that you can select for each report that you run.

Report list
This tab shows a list of reports that are ready for you to download. If you choose to subscribe to a report when scheduling one, then you'll also get an email that notifies you when the report is ready for you to download.
When the report is generating, the status column changes to “In Progress”. When the report is ready to download, the status column changes to “Complete”. Your report may take up to 24 hours to generate, depending on the size of the report and how many reports are queued. Generated reports will show up in the Report list tab.

  You can only have a maximum of 50 reports in this list. Once you reach that limit, delete some reports to generate new reports again.
Scheduled reports
This tab shows a list of reports that are set up to run recurringly. You can see the recurring details for each report and when they were last generated.
