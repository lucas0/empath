Share content with a cable to Board, Desk, and Room Series
You can share content from your laptop screen to your Board, Desk, or Room Series device with a USB-C or HDMI cable.
Board, Desk Series
Room Series
DX70, DX80
MX, SX
Make sure your laptop or other presentation source is switched on. Connect it to your Board or Desk Series device with a USB-C or HDMI cable.

Board Pro supports cabled sharing over both USB-C and HDMI. All other Board Series devices support HDMI only.
If you're sharing in a call, you'll see a popup message notifying you that you're about to share your screen.
Depending on the device's configuration, you have to tap the notification in order to Share in call, or to Cancel the share after all and Dismiss the popup.
Tap Stop sharing to end the share when you're finished.
The popup message you get depends on the setting of the configuration PresentationSelection. Set to:
AutoShare. There's a 5 second countdown before your screen is shared automatically. During the countdown, you can also tap buttons to Share in call immediately, or Cancel the share.
OnConnect. Tap a button to Share in call, or Dismiss the popup without sharing.
Desktop. Tap a button to Share in call, View a preview, or Dismiss the popup without sharing.
Manual. You won't get a notification at all. Sharing won't start until you tap the Share button on your device screen, and select the source.

When you connect your source by cable outside a call, your screen is shared automatically, unless the configuration PresentationSelection is set to Manual. In that case, sharing doesn't start until you tap the Share button on your device screen, and select the source.
