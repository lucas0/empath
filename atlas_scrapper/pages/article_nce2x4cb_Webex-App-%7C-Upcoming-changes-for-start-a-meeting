Webex App | Upcoming changes for start a meeting
We want to show you some changes we're making to how you start a meeting in Webex App.
Existing design
In the Meeting tab, you have the option to start a meeting and this currently starts a Personal room meeting.
New design
In September 2023, on the meeting tab you will see Start a Webex meeting, the default action will start a one-time meeting link or you can click the dropdown list to select Start a Personal Room meeting.
Administrators will have the ability to configure these options, they can choose which option is the default or remove the personal room option completely.
