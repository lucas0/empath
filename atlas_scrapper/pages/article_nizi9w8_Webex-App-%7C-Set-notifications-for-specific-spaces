Webex App | Set notifications for specific spaces
Notifications help you keep up-to-date with what's happening, so you don't miss anything. You can customize your notification settings for specific spaces to raise or lower the priority of the messages posted to them. Notifications for conversations between you and another person are on by default, but you can mute them if you prefer.
Webex App allows you to set notifications in two ways: globally so that the settings apply to all of your spaces or individually so the settings apply just to certain spaces. These settings work together to make sure you get notified about the messages that matter most to you. See Tips for Managing Notifications for help choosing the best combinations.
