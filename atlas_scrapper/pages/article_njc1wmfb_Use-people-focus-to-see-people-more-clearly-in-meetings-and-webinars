Use people focus to see people more clearly in meetings and webinars
Sometimes, people may be difficult to see if they're far away from their camera or if there are several people in the same room together. People focus crops the video of participants automatically in Webex Meetings and Webex Webinars so that you feel more connected.
While in grid view, people focus uses artificial intelligence to crop individual participant videos so that they make better use of screen space. If multiple people use the same Room or Board device to join a meeting, they may separate into individual videos so that you can see each participant individually. People who get separated into their own videos are still linked to everyone else using the same device, so if you make changes to one video in the group, they apply to all videos in the group.
People focus currently supports Webex Meetings, Webex Webinars, and Webex App for Windows and Mac.

  People focus crops the video of participants who join from the desktop app and from Room Series devices and Board Series devices running RoomOS 11.
People focus doesn't crop the video of people who join from the Meetings or Webinars mobile app or web app.
In grid view, click Layout , and then toggle People focus on.
