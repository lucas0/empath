Add your customer-managed device
In this article
Enterprise administrators can add third-party SIP devices like door phones, overhead pagers and ATAs, and digital fax solutions.
Get started with customer-managed devices
The customer must provision the devices manually and owns the SIP Authentication credential. The customer is responsible for any fraud created due to failure to secure these credentials.
The following specifications apply when adding third-party SIP devices:
Assign customer-managed devices to user or workspaces. Also you can assign each device to multiple users or workspaces.
All third-party device must support the Webex Calling Security requirements. See Security requirements for Webex Calling.
There are minimum firmware requirements in place. Check the third-party documentation for details.
Customer Managed Devices now offers two generic SIP profiles, which are Generic SIP Phone and Generic SIP Gateway. These profiles allow SIP-TLS 1.2 compliant devices to connect to Webex Calling, without adding the specific device name in the Control Hub. Similar to the other Customer Managed devices, Cisco Technical Support doesn’t investigate issues with devices connecting through this provisioning option.
