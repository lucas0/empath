View device statuses on Control Hub
You can search, list, and show status values from a specific device directly on Control Hub.
A status contains the current state of the device, such as connected calls, connected inputs, and output sources.
You can also select 6 statuses to be exposed on the deviceâ€™s details page. These favorites are connected to the Control Hub user, and the same statuses are exposed for all devices in the organization.
To find the description for the statuses, go to roomos.cisco.com.
Statuses are available on Control Hub for devices running RoomOS 10.12.1.4 and later or RoomOS 9.15.11.7 and later.
