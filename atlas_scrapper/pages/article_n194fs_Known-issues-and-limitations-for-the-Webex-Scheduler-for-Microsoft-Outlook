For Webex meetings scheduled with the Webex Scheduler, you see the Join button on Webex video devices only if the Webex Hybrid Calendar Service is enabled and configured according to the instructions in Make it easier for video devices to join meetings with OBTP.
Webex Personal Conference meetings with Webex Audio and audio-only meetings with teleconference service provider (TSP) audio are supported, but audio-only meetings with TSP audio aren’t supported for the Webex Scheduler.
When deleting an occurrence of a recurring meeting, you can delete only the latest ten occurrences within two years due to a performance limitation.
When updating one occurrence of a recurring meeting to an exception meeting, only an occurrence within two years can be updated successfully, due to a performance limitation.
If you scheduled a meeting using the Webex Scheduler and change the corresponding Outlook event while your meeting is in progress, the changes you made won't sync to your Webex site.
The Add Webex Meeting button never changes. The button label is the same whether you add a standard Webex meeting, a Webex Personal Room meeting, or if you've already added a Webex meeting.
Adding a Webex meeting to a single occurrence in a recurring meeting series that was previously scheduled in Outlook isn't supported.
If you make changes to your Webex meeting options, you must select Update to apply these changes.
To use the Webex Scheduler to edit meetings that you previously scheduled using Productivity Tools (Backward Compatibility), the minimum systems requirements are:
Microsoft Outlook 365 for Windows current channel version 1910 (build 12130 20382).
Microsoft Outlook 365 semi-annual version 2002 (build 16.0.12527.21230)

Changes in Webex settings to a series of meetings won't propagate to exception meetings of that same series. For example, if you cancel a series of Webex meeting, exception meetings continue to show Webex meeting information in Outlook even though the link for the Webex meeting is invalid.
If you remove a Webex meeting from a meeting or event to which it was added, a blank entry appears in Outlook. You must delete this entry to remove the meeting or event from their calendar.
Selecting Add Webex Meeting in your event automatically adds the event to your calendar and the calendar of invitees, even before you send it. If you delete the event without sending the invitation, the event gets removed from the calendar.
If you schedule a meeting that requires participant to register, the meeting invitation only shows the meeting join link. Invited participants must go to their Webex site to register for the meeting.
On Mac Outlook, meeting invitations may not show the correct formatting for lists due to a Microsoft Outlook Office.js limitation.
If you join a scheduled Webex meeting that's in a series, you'll be placed in the lobby by default.

Webex Scheduler adds the meeting details to your Outlook message in HTML. If your Outlook messages use the Rich Text Format (RTF), meeting invites may not appear correctly when the meeting invite details convert to RTF. Use HTML for your Outlook messages to see the correct formatting.

You might not be able to schedule meetings for other hosts using a shared folder (delegate scheduling) in Outlook for Windows. The options appear dimmed due to a Microsoft on-premises Exchange limitation. You can still schedule Webex meetings for others using their Webex host account with the Webex Scheduler. If you schedule meetings for other hosts, the Outlook meeting invite appears to be from you instead of the host you scheduled the meeting for. The host that you schedule the meeting for doesn’t receive a meeting invite in Outlook unless you add them as an attendee in Outlook.
On Mac Outlook, meeting invitations may not show the correct formatting for lists due to a Microsoft Outlook Office.js limitation.
