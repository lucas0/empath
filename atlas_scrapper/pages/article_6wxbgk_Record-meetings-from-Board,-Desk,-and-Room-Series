Record meetings from Board, Desk, and Room Series
Recordings are helpful for people who can't attend a meeting or for those who want to refer to what was discussed. You can record Webex meetings, Personal room meetings, and Webex space meetings on your device for other people to watch later.

You can record Webex meetings and Personal room meetings on your device as long as you are the meeting host or co-host. If you are on a shared device, type the host pin using your device when the meeting starts.
You can record Webex App space meetings on your device when your device is on personal mode. You can then start recording the meeting as long as you are present in the invitation for the meeting. It is possible to record a meeting from a shared device, but only if the device is present in the invitation for the meeting.
