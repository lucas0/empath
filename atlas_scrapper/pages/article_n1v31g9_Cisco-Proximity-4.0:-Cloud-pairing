Cisco Proximity 4.0: Cloud pairing
Cisco Proximity allows users to share content wirelessly, place calls and control video conferencing devices from their laptop, when they are close to a video conferencing device.
When Cisco Proximity is enabled, the video conferencing device transmits ultrasound pairing messages. These messages are received by nearby devices with the Cisco Proximity client, which can then pair automatically with the video conferencing device.
Cisco recommends deploying the Webex app for wireless sharing, device control and easy meeting join. But, where that's not possible, Cisco Proximity provides a lightweight and device-centric alternative without infrastructure dependencies.
You can download the Cisco Proximity app free of charge for Windows or OS X users here. Find out more about using the app here.
Cisco Proximity is available for devices linked with Webex Edge for Devices when cloud-managed software upgrade and Webex optimized experience is enabled.
