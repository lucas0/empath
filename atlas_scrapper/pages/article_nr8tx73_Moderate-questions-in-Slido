Moderate questions in Slido
As a Webex Meetings or Webex Webinars host, you can review all the questions submitted by the participants before they appear live for everyone to see. Otherwise, questions automatically appear live and are visible to everyone.
Slido is available in Webex Meetings. You can use Slido in plans for up to 10,000 users in Webex Webinars on version 41.9 and later sites. Slido polls are available for up to 10,000 attendees, while quizzes are available for up to 5,000 users.
