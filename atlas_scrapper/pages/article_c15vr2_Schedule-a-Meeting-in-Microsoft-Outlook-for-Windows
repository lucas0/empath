Schedule a Meeting in Microsoft Outlook for Windows
In this article
Schedule, edit, or cancel meetings from Microsoft Outlook on Windows using Cisco Webex Productivity Tools. Learn the prerequisites for scheduling a meeting and discover the various types of meetings that you can schedule.
Schedule a Meeting Prerequisites
You can schedule Webex meetings or appointments using the Webex Productivity Tools integration to Microsoft Outlook, and the process is very similar for both.
Please be aware of the following:
Not all the features available for scheduling meetings on your Webex site are available in Productivity Tools. This includes some of the recurrence patterns. For more info see Recurrence Pattern Limitation for the Webex Integration to Outlook.
The Webex integration to Outlook does not support all the recurrence options that are available in Microsoft Outlook.
In any meeting invitations that you send from Microsoft Outlook, the meeting's start time appears in the time zone that is set on your computer, and may not match the time zone preferences you have set on your Webex site.
Schedule a Webex Meeting
1
From the Home ribbon in Microsoft Outlook, click Schedule Meeting > Schedule Webex Meeting in the Webex group.
2
Verify the Webex Settings are correct, and click OK.
3
Click To and select who you want to invite to the meeting.
4
Add a Subject and a Location.
To add advanced meetings features like cohosts or breakout sessions for WBS40.9 and later sites, click Change Settings.
5
Click Send.
To remove a Webex meeting without cancelling the meeting, first open the meeting and click Cancel Webex or Cancel Personal Room. Then send the update.
Schedule a Personal Room Meeting
Personal Rooms are your own virtual conference room. It’s always available and you don’t have to book it. When you schedule a Personal Room meeting, the meeting takes place in your Personal Room, and the link to join the meeting is your Personal Room URL.

From the Home ribbon in Microsoft Outlook, go to Schedule Meeting > Schedule Personal Room Meeting in the Webex group.
2
Click To and select who you want to invite to the meeting.
3
Add a Location, and then click Send.

If you schedule a meeting that repeats every X week, where X is greater than 1, in Microsoft Outlook, the meeting is scheduled in Outlook as you specified, but appears as a weekly meeting on your Webex site.
The week start always points to the default value Sunday. Customization is not supported, so if you change the week start to a different day, the week start is not synchronized with the Webex site.
