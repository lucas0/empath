Create custom session types for your Webex site in Control Hub
You can create custom session types that enable or disable features for Webex Meetings Suite users.
Before you begin
You must have the custom session types options enabled to see Session Types options in the navigation bar. If you don't see Session Types options in Control Hub, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC).

  After you create a new session type, you can't delete it. However, you can modify it or turn it off.
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Services, and under Meeting, select Sites.
2
Choose the Webex site to change the settings for, and click Settings.
3
Under Common Settings, select Session Types.
4
Click Add session type under the parent session type that you want to add a custom session type to.
5
Enter a name for the custom session type, and then select the features that you want to include in the session type.
6
Click Save.

  To enable a host to host session with the custom session type that you created, enable that session type for the host user account.
