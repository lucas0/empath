Manage single sign-on integration in Control Hub
Use the SSO management features in Control Hub for certificate management and general SSO maintenance activities, such as updating an expiring certificate or checking on your existing SSO configuration. Each SSO management feature is covered in the individual tabs in this article.
Renew expiring certificates
Export metadata (to IdP)
Import metadata (to SP)
Manage SSO alerts
Single Logout
Deactivate SSO
SSO self recovery
