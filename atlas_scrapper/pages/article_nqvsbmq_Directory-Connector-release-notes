3.8.2000
March 30, 2023
The following feature is now available:
Configuring and synchronizing contact attributes
3.8.1005
February 16, 2023
We've made the following changes in this release of the Directory Connector:
This version of Directory Connector does not synchronize Distribution groups. Distribution groups are not used in Control Hub, so now we only synchronize the Security groups.
Directory Connector now uses the Windows user profile folder. We changed from using the browser cache folder because that folder can have access restrictions.
The software has an updated code signing certificate.
3.8.1001
October 31, 2022
We've made the following improvements:
Directory Connector now uses Microsoft Edge as the default browser, which supports web-based functions, such as the Duo SSO login page.
Upgraded the Directory Connector client to use Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 as the runtime library.
3.7.5000
August 5, 2022
The following features are now available:
Remove User Attribute Mapping
Manage Profile Pictures
3.7.2000
November 4, 2021
This update addresses a customer-found issue with synchronizing avatars from Active Directory. The new version has a 2 MB limit on the avatar file size. If an avatar file is greater than 2 MB, it does not prevent the synchronization.
3.7.1001
October 29, 2020
Added an in-product message that informs you to switch to auto synchronization mode if the Directory Connector is using a manual synchronization mode.
3.6
June 18, 2020
Added the following features and enhancements: shortcut to Directory Connector created on desktop after installation, dry runs now show a progress count, and you can now configure attributes for room objects.
Fixed the issue where user attribute mapping couldn't find userproxy attributes.
Refreshed Symantec code signing certificate.
3.5.1001
October 8, 2019
Added the following features and enhancements: send directory synchronization report to specific email addresses, avatar sync support for a proxy user in AD LDS, support for the avatar pattern 'cn' attribute, and Troubleshooting feature enhancements.
Changed the default incremental synchronization schedule from every 30 minutes to every 4 hours.
Fixed a scaling resolution issue that affected how Directory Connector was displayed in remote desktop sessions.
Fixed an issue so that groups are always shown on the Add Objects page even after a synchronization is performed.
3.4.1001
May 20, 2019
Added the following features: diagnostic tool, secure LDAP (LDAPS), and enhancements to attribute verification messages. For more information, see the Announcements tab and the deployment guide.
Enhanced the mismatch object deleting messages.
Fixed the issue where an admin could not sign in when FIPS was enabled.
Fixed the issue where the root domain guid couldn't be retrieved while the connector registered.
Fixed the issue where the connector crashed from a remote session to Windows Server 2012.
Fixed a sign in failure when the admin email contained +.
Fixed the issues where Active Directory avatar testing and uid format verification was not supported for AD LDS.
3.3.1003
February 15, 2019
Added the following features: customized attributes, Kerberos proxy support, embedded avatar profile synchronization, more attribute mappings to uid, automatic software upgrade, and support for credentials to access URL based avatar files. For more information, see the Announcements tab and the deployment guide.
Microsoft had a cookie issue which caused the Directory Connector incremental sync to fail. In this version, the problem is fixed.
3.0.1003
June 19, 2018
Security enhancement for TLS1.2 and its dependency, .NET Framework 4.5. The framework is enforced with this release, so the software can support TLS1.2.
This is a required upgrade, because Cisco will no longer support TLS1.0 and TLS1.1. Please upgrade to this release as soon as possible.

  While we strongly recommend that you upgrade to 3.0.1003, if you upgraded to 3.0.1001, you must be running .NET Framework 4.5 for your deployment to be in compliance.
3.0.1001
April 23, 2018
Added new features: support for Active Directory deployments with multiple domains under a single forest or multiple forests, NTLM support, userPrincipalName (Active Directory attribute) can be mapped to uid (cloud attribute), and TLS 1.2 support. For more information, see the Announcements tab and the deployment guide.
