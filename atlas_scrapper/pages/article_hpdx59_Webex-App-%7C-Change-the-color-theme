Webex App | Change the color theme
You can choose a different color theme to personalize your Webex App experience. Each theme uses a different color palette that completely changes the overall appearance of the app.

  If you subscribe to Webex from your Service Provider, your color theme has been designed by your Provider. Please direct all questions to your Providerâ€™s customer support team.

  If your organization administrator has disabled custom colors, you won't see the appearance tab in your settings.

When you set your OS high contrast setting, Webex App picks up that setting, and shows the high contrast color palette you've selected. You can take the app out of high contrast by selecting a different theme from the list.
If you restart or exit the app, it remembers the last theme you selected before enabling your OS high contrast setting.
