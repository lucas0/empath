Raise Hand in a meeting on Board, Desk, and Room Series
Use the Raise Hand button to let others know you have a question or a comment without interrupting the conversation.
Raise Hand is available in meetings with more than two participants. It's not available in meetings started from a Webex space.
When you raise your hand, it's visible on the Webex apps and on devices that support this feature. You can also see if someone has raised their hand from the Webex apps.

In a meeting, access the call controls and select the Reactions button . Tap Raise hand .


If you don't see the Reactions button, tap More first.
You can long press on the emoji to change the skin tone. When your device is on personal mode, the skin tone you chose will remain. On shared devices, the skin tone will be reset when the call ends.
Everyone in the meeting sees an on-screen notification that someone has raised their hand. The notification with a full name shows up for the first raised hand.


After that, the Raise Hand icon shows how many have raised their hands.
On touch screen devices, tap the Raise Hand icon to open the participant list and see who raised their hand. On other devices, open the participant list from the touch controller. Participants who raised their hand appear at the top in chronological order.
