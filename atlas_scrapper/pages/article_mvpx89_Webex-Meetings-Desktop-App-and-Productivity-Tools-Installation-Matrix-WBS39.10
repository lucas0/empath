Desktop app is automatically installed on Windows and Mac when joining or starting a meeting.
User can install or mass deploy Productivity Tools.
The pre-meeting app is required and is automatically installed as it is a part of the Desktop app package.
So, if the customer doesn't mass deploy, the pre-meeting app will be installed automatically. The versions of the pre-meeting app may vary, based on the site where the meeting was hosted.
Users with Microsoft Outlook plugin or Outlook plugin + desktop app (WBS33.x-WBS39.9)
Starting with the WBS39.10 update, IT administrators must deploy both the Webex Meetings desktop app and Webex Productivity Tools to retain Microsoft Office integrations. Separate desktop app and Productivity Tools packages are available from the Downloads page on your Webex site.
Keep, Automatically upgrade Webex Productivity Tools when new versions are available unchecked in the Webex Site Administration or Webex Control Hub, to allow Productivity Tools to stay on version WBS39.10. IT administrators will then have to deploy the supported version of Productivity Tools on a regular basis.
IT administrators can choose to automatically upgrade Productivity Tools if their users are in a Windows environment. However, Productivity Tools upgrade requires admin rights for Mac, so do not turn on automatic upgrade if you have Mac users.

Check Automatically upgrade Webex Productivity Tools when new versions are available in Webex Site Administration or Webex Control Hub.
Outlook integrations and desktop app are kept after the upgrade.
