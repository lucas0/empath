Webex App | Control someone's camera during a video call
Get a better view of someone during a video call by controlling the angle of their camera and even zooming in and out. If you're in healthcare, for example, you can focus on facial expressions and any physical ailments a patient may have so you can provide high quality care.
Make sure the person you're talking to is connected to a TelePresence device.
You can only control a camera remotely if the far-end device doesn't have activated camera tracking enabled. That's where the camera follows the active speaker.
You donâ€™t have remote access to any camera presets.
1
Select the Far End Camera Control to show the control panel. You can tilt the camera up or down, pan left or right, and even zoom in or out.
2
When you're done controlling the camera, select the Far End Camera Control again to hide the control panel and continue with your call.
