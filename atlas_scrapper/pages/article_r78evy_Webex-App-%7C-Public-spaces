Webex App | Public spaces
Public spaces are created within your organization and are easily discoverable. Discover, join, or create public spaces and connect with people with similar interests, or keep up with the latest news.
Public spaces are different from other spaces, as they aren't tied to a specific team. Only people in your organization can find a public space that you create. If you change your mind, you can make a public space private again at any time. If you can't see public spaces, contact your administrator for more information.
