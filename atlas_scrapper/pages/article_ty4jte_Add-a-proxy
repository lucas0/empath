Add a proxy
Use the following procedure to add an authenticated proxy or new proxies after onboarding.

The supported proxy authentication schemes are Basic and Digest.
You can add only one proxy at a time.
Before you begin
Ensure that you have installed the Agent COP file on the node.
1
Log in to the Unified CM or IM and Presence node using the admin CLI.
2
Check the proxy list using the following CLI command:
admin:utils ucmgmt proxy list
3
Add a new proxy using the following CLI command:
admin:utils ucmgmt proxy add http://<host>:<port> [username]

  Perform this step on all nodes in the cluster.
If you're adding an authenticated proxy, provide the username and password in the previously mentioned command.
For example, admin:utils ucmgmt proxy add http://proxy.dummy.com:80 abc
The following is a sample output.
Successfully contacted controller.
{
"serviceName" : "HCSAC",
"serviceType" : "REQUIRED",
"serviceState" : "online",
"message" : "Healthy",
"lastUpdated" : "2020-08-04T15:34:52.931Z",
"upstreamServices" : [

{ "serviceName" : "RDS", "serviceType" : "REQUIRED", "serviceState" : "online", "message" : "Healthy", "lastUpdated" : "2020-08-04T15:34:45.476Z", "upstreamServices" : [ ] }
]
}
4
Disable the telemetry service on each node. For more information, see Start and Stop the Telemetry Service section in Set Up Cisco Webex Cloud-Connected UC for On-Premises Devices.

  If you're onboarding a node for the first time, skip this step.
5
Check if the proxy list now has http://<host>:<port> added.
admin:utils ucmgmt proxy list
6
After you have completed the preceding steps, restart the service on the Control Hub so that the telemetry module selects the new proxy information.

  If you're onboarding a node for the first time, skip this step.
