Personalize your Cisco Headset 730 name
Tired of the same old headset name showing up in device Bluetooth settings? You can personalize your Cisco Headset 730 name to make it easier to identify in Bluetooth device lists.
You can personalize the name associated with your Cisco Headset 730. The name change saves to the headset and appears in any Bluetooth device list. You can return your headset to the default name anytime through the Reset Settings button in the app.

  Some devices, such as Windows computers, might not immediately recognize your headset after the name change. To avoid call control issues, forget and re-pair your headset, or restart your computer.
Before you begin
Make sure:
Your headset is on
Your headset is connected to the Cisco Headsets app
Your headset has firmware 1-8-0-213 or later
1
In the Cisco Headsets app, tap Settings > Device info > Name.
2
Enter the name you want to appear in Bluetooth device lists.
3
Tap Save.
