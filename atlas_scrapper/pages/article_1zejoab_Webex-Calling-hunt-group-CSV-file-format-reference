Webex Calling hunt group CSV file format reference
You can add and manage hunt groups in bulk using a hunt group CSV. This article covers the specific fields and values needed for the CSV upload of Webex Calling hunt groups.
Known limitations and requirements
Before uploading your hunt group CSV, make sure to read Bulk provisioning Webex Calling elements using CSV to understand the CSV conventions.
You can either export your current hunt groups, which allows you to add, delete, or modify your existing data set, or you can export a sample set of hunt groups. Once modified, the file can be uploaded through the bulk features.

Exporting CSV file into ZIP file format: When exporting data to a CSV file, the number of records may exceed 1000. In such cases, the ZIP file is downloaded, where the ZIP file contains the fullset of record(s) in a single CSV file. A separate folder containing all the data is brokendown into multiple CSV files with less than 1000 records. These files are generated for the administrators to quickly import any updates and upload.
It is important to know the mandatory and optional columns, and information that you’ll need to provide when filling out the CSV template. The specific fields for the hunt group CSV are found in the table below.
The maximum amount of hunt groups for each location is 1,000.
