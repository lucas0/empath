Share Information and the Webex Room Phone
You can use your phone to share information between your computer and an HDMI display screen. This article explains each of the share options.
Share makes it easy for you to share information with your colleagues. It depends upon how your phone is set up, but you can share from your computer to a Webex meeting, an HDMI screen, or both.
You have two ways to share content:
Wireless sharing—Allows you to share content without cables. You collaborate with your coworkers using either Webex or with Guest share. This feature is only available if your administrator configures it.
Cable sharing—Allows you to share content with the included HDMI cables.
If you accept a call, then Share stops.

You can connect your phone to the Webex App with Proximity pairing. This gives you the proximity enabled features on the Webex meeting and teams app.
This feature is only available if your administrator configures it.
