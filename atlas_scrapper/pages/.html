Localization logic for audio prompts for CCA-SP customers
What is the logic for playing local audio prompts for a CCA-SP customer; what are the language preferences in the Locale parameter of the SIP URI and what are the language locale codes?
Localization logic for audio prompts for CCA-SP customers

  The Cloud Connected Audio Service Provider (CCA-SP) should first ensure that the bridge they are on indeed supports locale tagging.
CCA-SP partners should work with their Cisco account representative and Webex Cloud Services to confirm this before sending tags in an invite header.
The logic governing how local audio prompts are played for a CCA-SP customer is different for Callbacks and Dial-In connections. The principles are as follows:
Callback
Audio prompt localization is based on the user's Webex site preference. If no preference is set, the user's browser default language will be chosen.
Audio prompts cannot be customized for a specific CCA-SP partner or customer.
Dial-in
Audio prompt localization is determined at the call level. (SIP invite level.)
Partners can choose to play the prompt in any of the supported languages by sending the appropriate language tag (as documented under Language preferences and language locale codes for SIP URl locale parameter below).
Audio prompt localization does not require any release control or change control.
If a partner does not send a language locale tag in the SIP invite, then Webex will play audio prompts in the default language for the bridge, irrespective of the dial-in number.
The default language for the bridge is standardized across an audio bridge and cannot be customized for any specific CCA-SP partner or customer.
Language preferences and language locale codes for SIP URl locale parameter
CCA-SP partners need to communicate a language preference by sending a Locale in the SIP URI. The locale tag should be present in the SIP To header of the invite message to identify which language is desired. For example:
To: <sip::55156202@10.224.56.202;locale=en_US>
Webex examines this parameter and plays audio prompts in the local language.
