Create recording transcripts in Webex Meetings, Webex Webinars, and Webex Events (classic)
You can automatically transcribe the audio of your meetings, webinars, and events that you record in MP4 format. The transcript displays when you play the recording, and you can search the transcription to verify when something was said.
Transcriptions are only available in English for Webex.
On your Webex site, go to Preferences > Recording and check the Create recording transcripts for all my MP4 recordings check box.

  If you don't see this option, either your site administrator has chosen to create transcripts automatically for all recordings or your site administrator hasn't allowed you to create recording transcripts automatically.
What to do next
To view the recording transcript, see View, search, and edit Webex recording transcripts.
