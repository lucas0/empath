Manage billing information in Control Hub
As an administrator, you can view your billing information in Control Hub.
As a full administrator, you can add and update payment methods for your organization from Control Hub. When you want to change the card, you update the billing information. Billing information only shows up for paid subscriptions, and not for trial accounts.

  Billing information is only available for customers who purchased subscriptions from webex.com. If you purchased Webex subscriptions from a partner, contact that partner for billing information.
For Webex Online customers, see this article on how to access your billing information.
1
Sign in to Control Hub and open the Account page.
2
Select Billing Info.
When there's more than one credit card in Billing Info, assign the Default Payment Method to the one to use for the next payment.
