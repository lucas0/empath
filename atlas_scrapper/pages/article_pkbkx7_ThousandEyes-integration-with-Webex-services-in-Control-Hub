ThousandEyes endpoint agents for Troubleshooting in Control Hub
You can integrate ThousandEyes with Troubleshooting in Control Hub so you can see full path visibility of users across the network to isolate issues with greater clarity. When a user with a ThousandEyes endpoint agent installed on their machine joins a meeting through the Webex App, a Network Path line will be visible under Audio Quality in their participant details page. This line indicates the network path quality of audio data between the userâ€™s client and the audio media node.
In general, audio and video data travel the same path, and serviced by the same media node, so you can get a good sense of what the user's video quality is like, too. The network path quality is displayed as dotted lines. Each dotted line is based on the intervals set in the automated session test.
