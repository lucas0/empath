Search for Devices in Your Organization
You can search for devices in Cisco Webex Control Hub. Use the interactive search field, pie chart, or pie chart legend to refine the results. A refined search can be helpful if you have lots of devices in your organization.
Clicking around is the best way to understand how the search function works. You can use parenthesis in a search to find devices that contain one term or another. For example, if you want to find devices that have the tag third floor or fourth floor, you can type Tags=(third floor or fourth floor). Similarly, you can replace the parenthesis with quotation marks to search for an exact term.
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Devices, and then narrow down your results by using these filters as needed:
Enter the word or phrase that you want to search for in the search field; the search field then auto-suggests, auto-completes, and refines as you type more of your search term.
Place your cursor in the search field and click through the options that show up in the drop-down list.
Click a segment of the pie chart or a pie chart legend item to refine your search.
