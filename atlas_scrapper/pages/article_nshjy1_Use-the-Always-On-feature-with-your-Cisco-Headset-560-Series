Use the Always On feature with your Cisco Headset 560 Series
You can keep your audio connection active between the headset and base.
By default, there is a delay of about 2 seconds at the beginning of calls while the headset establishes a connection with the base. Always On mode allows you to keep your audio connected between your headset and base even when you aren't on a call or playing music.

  This feature is not visible if the administrator turns it off in Control Hub.
Because the headset and base maintain a continuous connection, Always on mode will impact headset deployment in denser DECT environments.
Always on mode also draws more power and may impact battery life.
This feature is disabled by default, follow the steps below to turn on it:
1
Launch Webex App.
2
Click your profile picture, and select Settings > Devices.
3
Choose your headset, and select Advanced settings > General settings > Wireless.
4
Turn on Always on.
Changes automatically save to your headset.
