Clean Your Cisco Headset
Periodically, you may need to clean your headset.
1
Wipe the headband and ear cups on your headset with a soft, dry cloth.
2
Optional: If a headset requires additional cleaning, apply a small amount of non-alcohol-based cleaning agent onto a soft, clean, lint-free cloth, and gently wipe down the headset. Avoid using a 70% isopropyl alcohol solution, as it may discolor or cloud the surface and potentially degrade the integrity of the device over time.
If the headset requires disinfection, you may use a 70% isopropyl alcohol solution at your own risk.
Replacement ear pads are available to order on the headsets.

  Don't allow moisture to get inside your ear cups, the USB-C port, or the 3.5 mm jack.
Damage to your Cisco products as a result of cleaning and disinfecting isn't covered under our warranties or product guarantees.
