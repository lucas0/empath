Highlight questions in Slido
Webex Meetings or Webex Webinars hosts can highlight a question to make it obvious to participants which question is being discussed during a live Q&A session. When highlighted, the question remains at the top of the question list.
Slido is available in Webex Meetings. You can use Slido in plans for up to 10,000 users in Webex Webinars on version 41.9 and later sites. Slido polls are available for up to 10,000 attendees, while quizzes are available for up to 5,000 users.
Before you begin
Make sure you've turned on the Q&A feature in Slido.
During a meeting or webinar, go to the Q&A tab in Slido, select the live question, and then click Highlight question .
Click when you no longer want to highlight the question.
