Webex App | Sign in to a hunt group
If your administrator has set you up to be a member of a hunt group, you're notified when a call comes into that hunt group number. Depending on how your administrator sets up the hunt group, you may be automatically signed out of a hunt group if you miss a call. If that's the case, you'll need to sign back in to answer other calls.

Go to Call Settings and turn on Hunt group.
When a call comes into your hunt group, you'll receive a notification in the app and can answer the call from there.
The call is also included in your call history.

  If you have multiple lines set up, hunt group calls can come in on any of those lines. The notification and call history let you know which line was used. If you sign out or sign into a hunt group, all the lines sign out or sign in too.
