Virtual Extension Configuration in Control Hub
You can assign extensions to external phone numbers that users frequently call to make users' lives easier.
You may have remote workers on a separate telephony system or a key customer you want to reach easily. First, you can associate an extension with their external phone number. Then, you can contact them using their extension just like you contact anybody else in your organization with an assigned extension. For calls from external phone numbers associated with a virtual extension, the virtual extension and the name assigned to that virtual extension are presented on the called destination within Webex Calling.
There are two modes of operation for virtual extensions. The mode you choose applies to your entire organization. The vast majority of customers will use the default mode (Standard). The steps presented here apply to Standard mode. You can select the other available mode (Enhanced). Still, virtual extensions will not function correctly unless your PSTN provider supports particular network signaling extensions (edge case). For more information, see Change Your Virtual Extension Mode.
In Standard mode, virtual extensions must be associated with a valid E.164.
