Display the Short Video Address Format for Webex Meetings and Events
After setting up your Webex Meetings deployment to allow video devices to join with the short video address format, you can choose to display the short format in the meeting invitation instead of the full video address.
Overview
When you enable the Short Video Address setting for your Webex site, the short format shows in the meeting invitation to let participants know they can join a meeting with that video address on their video devices.
For more information on how to set up the short video address format for your Webex Meetings deployment, see Short Video Address Format for Webex Meetings and Events.

  When you use the short video address format (meet@webex.com), the Video Mesh node always handles the call. The node handles the call even if the call is to a site that doesn't have Video Mesh enabled.
