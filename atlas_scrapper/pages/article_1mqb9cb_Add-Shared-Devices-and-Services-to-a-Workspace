Add Shared Devices and Services to a Workspace
When people are at work, they get together in lots of workspaces like huddle rooms, lobbies, and conference rooms. You can set up shared Webex devices in these workspaces, add services, and then watch the collaboration happen. Whatever device you choose to add to that workspace, the device is assigned to the workspace, not a user. The key advantage is shared usage.
