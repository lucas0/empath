Best practices for using the Web Engine
In this article
Follow these recommendations for a better usage of the web engine on your Board, Desk, or Room device. When the web engine is enabled, you can configure digital signage, and open web apps and Enterprise Content Management files.
Supported Features
The web browser is based on a standard Chromium browser. The following features are available:
HTML5
EcmaScript 6
CSS3
Web fonts
Multi-touch
SVG
Canvas
Iframes
Web sockets
Web assembly
Web workers
WebGL: WebGL is an experimental feature and might change in the future. WebGL is disabled by default, but can be enabled on the local web interface of the device.
Select Settings from the menu on the left. Under Configurations, choose the following: WebEngine > Features > WebGL: On.
SipUrlHandler: SipUrlHandler can be enabled on local web interface of the device. This configuration allows you to start SIP calls directly from web view based features (for example a web app or digital signage). The user selects a button labeled with SIP:yourSipUrl to initiate a call, and the call is then placed by the device.
Select Settings from the menu on the left. Under Configurations, choose the following: WebEngine > Features > SipUrlHandler: On.
Limitations
The following features are currently not supported:
PDF
Password manager (Flash etc.)
Downloading and uploading files
Notifications

Only one web window or tab is supported. If a web page tries to open a page in a new window or tab, it replaces the existing page.

Joining WebRTC calls on meeting platforms through a web app is not supported. To enable WebRTC and join Google Meet meetings or Microsoft Teams meetings, read this article and this article.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter a problem with a web page, you can turn on RemoteDebugging from the local web interface of the device. Select Settings from the menu on the left and then, select Configurations from the top of the middle pane. Then, choose the following:
WebEngine > RemoteDebugging: RemoteDebugging allows you to run the Chrome developer console on your laptop. Make sure to turn off RemoteDebugging after use. RemoteDebugging lets you access the Chrome developer console and identify potential issues with a web page. When enabled, a banner is displayed at the bottom of the screen, warning the users that they may be monitored. The banner also shows the URL that you can enter in your local Chrome browser to open the developer console.

If a web page is not supported, the device goes directly to normal half wake mode instead of displaying the web page. You can see more information in the web portal of the device by selecting Issues and Diagnostics from the menu on the left.
Your configured proxy is used for all requests used by the system, including the web engine. Note that the web engine doesn't use the custom uploaded certificate. If you have problems displaying certain web pages, check your system proxy settings.
