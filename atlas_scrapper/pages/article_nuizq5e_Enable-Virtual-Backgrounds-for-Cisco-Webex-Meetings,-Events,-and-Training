Enable Virtual Backgrounds for Cisco Webex Meetings, Events, and Training
As a Webex site administrator, you can turn on virtual backgrounds for everyone in your organization so they can limit distractions and maintain their privacy whenever they meet. In addition to the blur and provided virtual backgrounds, you can also allow users to add their own custom background.
The following application versions support virtual backgrounds:
Mac and Windows—40.6.x and later (40.8 and later for custom backgrounds) for Webex Meetings and Webex Events.
iOS—40.4 and later for Webex Meetings, Webex Events, and Webex Training. 40.2 and earlier for Webex Meetings only.
Android—40.6 and later for Webex Meetings, Webex Events, and Webex Training
Site Administration
Control Hub
1
Sign in to Webex Site Administration and go to Configuration > Common Site Setting > Options.
2
Scroll down to Site Options and check the box next to Enable virtual background.

  If your Webex site is version 40.4.12 or earlier, you also need to check Display user avatars in the meeting client (Meetings) in order to enable virtual backgrounds for iOS users.
To let users choose their own backgrounds, check the box next to Allow users to add a custom background.

  Custom background images only save locally to the computer or mobile device. They don't upload to the cloud. If a meeting host or attendee wants to use the same image on another device, they need to add it again on the new device.
