Start an Instant Meeting on Board, Desk, and Room Devices
Anyone can start a Webex meeting instantly on any shared Board Pro Series, Desk Series, or Room Device that has RoomOS 11.3 or later. You can simply start a meeting directly from the device and invite participants by scanning a QR code. Invitees can be internal or external to your organization.
Instant meetings are enabled by default, but administrators can disable device hosted meetings for all shared devices in a workspace. Read here for more information.
You can start a Webex meeting on any shared Board Pro Series, Desk Series, or Room Device and invite participants inside or outside your organization, simply by sharing the meeting link. It is also possible to add participants from the organisation's directory.
