Webex App | Turn off content sharing for participants in a meeting
Hosts and cohosts can control who shares during a meeting. Only hosts, cohosts, and participants with the Presenter role can share their screen or applications in a meeting.
This feature is available on our Video Mesh-ready meeting platform.
Only hosts and cohosts can turn off sharing for participants.
When participants try to share in a meeting, they get a notification that they can't share. After hosts or cohosts turn off this setting, participants who join the meeting later also can't share content.
After hosts or cohosts turn off sharing, the host or cohost can pass a Presenter role to a particular participant in the meeting to share. If the Presenter role passes to a participant who's paired to a device, the device also inherits the Presenter role. If there are other participants paired to that same device, they can't share from their computer with Webex App. However, if the Presenter role is passed to a device, each participant paired to that device can share from Webex App.
