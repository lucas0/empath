Integrate calendars with the meeting list of the Webex Meetings app
Can’t find your meetings in the meeting list? You can select what appears in the meeting list of the Webex Meetings mobile app. Make it match what’s listed on your Webex site, mobile device, or Microsoft Office 365 calendar, or any combination you like.
1
Open the Webex Meetings app and tap Settings to view the main settings menu.
2
Tap Meeting List to open the Calendar Integration selections.
3
Choose from the following options:
Select Webex Calendar to integrate Webex scheduled meetings and Personal Room meetings from your Webex site and see these upcoming meetings in the Meetings app.
Select Device Calendar to integrate meetings that are scheduled on your mobile device and see these upcoming meetings in the Meetings app.
Select Office 365 Calendar to integrate meetings from Outlook and see these upcoming meetings in the Meetings app.

  If a meeting exists in the Webex Calendar, the Microsoft Office 365 Calendar, and the Device Calendar at the same time, the Webex Calendar displays first and duplicate entries don't appear.
The priority level for the Calendar is as follows: Webex Calendar > Office 365 Calendar > Device Calendar. Only Webex meetings appear in the meeting list.
If you are unable to see scheduled Personal Room Meetings and are using iOS 12.2. or later, your organization's Mobile Device Management policy is restricting 3rd party apps from full access to your corporate accounts. To resolve this, your site administrator must deploy the Webex Meetings application from the Webex Management Program. For more information, please contact your site administrator.
