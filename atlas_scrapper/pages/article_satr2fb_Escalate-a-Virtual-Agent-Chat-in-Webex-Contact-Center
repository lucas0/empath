Escalate a Virtual Agent Chat in Webex Contact Center
Use the Webex Control Hub and Google Dialogflow to enable a Virtual Agent to escalate a chat to experts. When a Virtual Agent cannot resolve a customer request, the Virtual Agent escalates the request to a subject matter expert.
If you are a customer administrator or partner administrator, you can enable chat escalation in your virtual agents by adding a GetExpert action to the intent in your Dialogflow agent. Intent describes the intention of the customer for the chat conversation.
For more information on using intents, see Intents in Google Dialogflow documentation.
When a customer enters a query, it triggers an intent. If the intent contains a GetExpert action, the Virtual Agent escalates the chat to an expert in the Agent Desktop.
You can configure the GetExpert action trigger in Dialogflow to control when your Virtual Agent should escalate conversations to a human agent.
In Dialogflow, you can trigger the intent when:
The customer enters certain phrases.
A specific piece of customer information is available in the conversation.
The customer enters a phrase that the Dialogflow agent cannot recognize.
There is a follow-up to another triggered intent.
You can download a preconfigured intent from https://virtual-assistant.produs1.ciscoccservice.com/DialogFlow/escalation.json . Use your Dialogflow agent's console to upload the preconfigured intent. For more information, see the Export and Import section in the Agent Settings topic in Google Dialogflow documentation.
After you have created a Dialogflow agent with intents in Google's Dialogflow console, you must configure your Virtual Agent in the Webex Control Hub to integrate with the Dialogflow agent. For more information, see the Configure a Virtual Agent in Webex Contact Center article.
