Key Expansion Module Limitations
Audio (A version) and Video (V version) Key Expansion Modules can be used interchangeably on supported devices, with these limitations:
Key expansion modules connected to multiplatform phones can be used for monitoring line overflow and manual long-press, speed-dial assignment.
Key expansion modules connected to multiplatform phones only support default background images.
Key expansion modules are used as overflow for Webex Calling and keys can’t be assigned. If an administrator assigns more monitored lines than the phone can handle, the line status overflows to the key expansion module. For more information, see Cisco IP Phone 6800 Series and Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series Multiplatform Phones.
