Webex Meetings, Webex Webinars, and Webex Events (classic) accessibility features
Learn about accessibility support for Meetings, Webinars, and Events (classic), from using keyboard shortcuts to using screen readers.
Accessibility standards and improvements
For details about accessibility conformance in meetings, webinars, and events, see the Webex Meetings voluntary product accessibility templates.
For more info about the accessibility improvements we're making to Webex services, see the Webex Meetings Suite accessibility improvements.
Low vision support
Webex has limited support for low vision accessibility features that apply across our desktop and web apps.
The application supports the high contrast scheme of the Windows OS.
The application supports the zoom functionality of the OS.
Screen reader support
We test Webex Meetings to ensure compatibility with the latest version of the Freedom Scientific JAWS screen reader.
All keyboard shortcuts for the Meetings desktop app work with screen readers.
Screen readers can't read content from shared presentations, shared applications, and shared desktops.
You can manage which notifications you want to have your screen reader announce. For more information, see Manage which notifications your screen reader announces.
Keyboard shortcuts
On Windows and MacOS, you can use Tab or Shift + Tab to navigate the meeting window. You can still use the following shortcuts for faster navigation:
F6—Switch between the panels area and the main window.
Ctrl + Tab—Move between multiple open panels.

  Keyboard shortcuts are available on the Meetings desktop app, but not the web app. The web app has limited accessibility feature support that applies only to the Low Vision Support section.

Make global shortcuts
Turn a shortcut into a global shortcut so that you can still use it when the meeting, webinar, or event application isn't in focus.
During a meeting, go to Help > Keyboard Shortcuts.
In the Keyboard Shortcuts dialog, check the Global Shortcut box next to the shortcut.
You can revert to a local shortcut at any time by unchecking the box.
Customize shortcut commands
If a default shortcut conflicts with a key command that you use in other applications, you can edit or delete it.
During a meeting, go to Help > Keyboard Shortcuts.
Click on a key command to edit or delete the shortcut.
To edit the shortcut, simultaneously press the keys for the new command. Webex automatically saves your changes.
To delete the shortcut, click on the X next to the key combination. When cleared, the key command reads Not Set. Press Enter to save.
Shortcut requirements and limitations:
A valid shortcut must be a unique key combination that is not already used to define another shortcut within the application.
Shortcuts can contain up to four keys per command.
You can combine any of the following keys once per command: Alt, Ctrl, Shift, and one other key that's a letter, number, punctuation, or command.
The keyboard shortcut feature doesn't support certain special keys, like PrtSc, so you can't include them in a command.
Some default keyboard shortcuts, such as F6 or Ctrl Tab, aren’t customizable. All shortcuts that you can edit or delete are available in the Keyboard Shortcuts preferences.
Restore default shortcuts
To restore the default shortcut settings, click Restore Defaults in Keyboard Shortcuts preferences. You can't selectively restore default shortcuts.
