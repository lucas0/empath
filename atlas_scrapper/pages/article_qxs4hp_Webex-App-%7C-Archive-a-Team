Webex App | Archive a Team
Teams are created to make it easy for their members to collaborate in spaces in Webex App. After a while though, some of your teams might not be active anymore. Teams can't be deleted, but if you're the team moderator you can archive a team, so no one can use it. The team will continue to exist but it won't be accessible to team members. You can always restore an archived team again later if you need to.

You have to be the moderator of the team to archive it.
