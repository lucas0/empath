Sign up for the mobile application management program
You can use a mobile application management service to distribute Webex Meetings and Webex App mobile applications for your organization.
Using a mobile device management service allows you to control user access to app functions such as sign-in methods, meeting sources, and video access. When you sign up for the mobile application management program, you can also request access to the mobile application management community. The community enables you to download unsigned versions of Meetings, Webex App, and Jabber for iOS and Android. You can also discuss and report any issues that you might have with the Cisco mobile applications with Cisco technology experts.
Before you begin
Review the Mobile application management program.
1
Contact your Cisco account representative to complete the Mobile Application Management two-way agreement.
2
Create a Cisco.com ID if you don't already have one:
To create an account, go to the registration site.
Click the activation link in the system generated activation email that you receive from Cisco.
It can take up to 10 minutes for your new ID to propagate in the Cisco.com system.
3
Go to the Cisco Insider User Group site and sign in with your Cisco.com ID.
This step adds your Cisco.com ID into our administration portal, to ensure that we can grant you access to the Cisco Mobile Application Management community.
4
Complete the mobile application management community registration survey.
After you complete the survey, you will receive an email within 72 business hours notifying you that you have access to the community.
