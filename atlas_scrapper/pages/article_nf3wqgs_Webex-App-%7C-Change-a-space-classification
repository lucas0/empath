Webex App | Change a space classification
You can increase a space's classification to a higher, more restricted level, but you can't decrease it to a lower, less restricted level. Anyone can change the classification label, except in moderated spaces, where only moderators can make changes.

1
Go to Messaging and select the space you want to reclassify.
2
Click Space information, and then choose Edit space policy.

  If your menu has the option View space policy instead of Edit space policy, that means you're not a moderator. To change the classification, you need to ask a moderator for help.
3
Under Space classification, choose a higher classification label from the drop-down list.

  Public spaces can be discovered by anyone in your organization. When creating a public space, the space classification must be set to the lowest level.
