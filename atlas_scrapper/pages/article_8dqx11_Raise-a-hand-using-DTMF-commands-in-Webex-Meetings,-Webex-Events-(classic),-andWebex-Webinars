Raise a hand using DTMF commands in Webex Meetings, Webex Events (classic), and Webex Webinars
If you dial into a Meeting, Event (classic), or Webinar, you can use DTMF commands to raise your hand for a question. In Events (classic), hosts can disable the *3 raise hand option.
Before you begin:
Hosts need to use the latest Meetings application
The *3 command isnâ€™t available for attendees who joined from the desktop, web, or mobile app
The audio prompts are available in all local languages
To hear a list of DTMF commands available during your meeting or event, press **.
1
When it's time to join, open the email invitation and use the Join by phone information to dial in.
2
Enter the access code from the email invitation, followed by the pound sign, and then enter pound again when prompted.

Once the meeting starts, if you have a question, press *3 to raise your hand.
Audio prompt: "You have raised your hand to ask a question. Please wait to speak until the host calls on you."

If you no longer want to ask a question, or the host has already called on you, then press *3 to lower your hand.
Audio confirmation: "You have lowered your hand."
