Webex App | Move a call into a meeting
When you're in the middle of a call with someone, you may want to invite other people into the discussion and make use of some advanced meetings features. Just move that call into a meeting. From there, everyone has access to reactions, breakout sessions, Webex Assistant for Webex Meetings, and more.
1
During a call, click More, and then select Invite and meet.
2
Choose one of these options:
Search for people you want to invite to the meeting and then click Meet now.
Click Meet now to keep the meeting between you and the person you're in the call with.
The call ends and Meetings opens.
Everyone that you invite receives a meeting invitation. They can join the meeting from their desktop app, mobile app, or any Webex device they're connect to.
