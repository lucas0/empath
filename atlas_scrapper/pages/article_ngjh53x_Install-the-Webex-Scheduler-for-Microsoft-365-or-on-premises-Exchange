Install the Webex Scheduler for Microsoft 365 or on-premises Exchange
The Webex Scheduler is an add-in for Outlook users to schedule, attend, and track Webex meetings. Follow this article to install it from AppSource (for Microsoft 365) or with the manifest file (for Microsoft Exchange).
When you install the Webex Scheduler, a note appears that the Webex Scheduler uses the permission Read/write mailbox. The Webex Scheduler uses this permission to make Exchange Web Services API calls.
Install the Webex Scheduler from Microsoft AppSource
Use Microsoft AppSource to install and deploy the Webex Scheduler, so that you automatically get updates to the Webex Scheduler.

  You cannot use Microsoft AppSource to install and deploy the Webex Scheduler for Microsoft Exchange.

Install the Webex Scheduler from a manifest file
