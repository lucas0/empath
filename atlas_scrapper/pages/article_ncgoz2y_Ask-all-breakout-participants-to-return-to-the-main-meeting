Ask all breakout participants to return to the main meeting
As a host or cohost, you can send a message to participants in all breakout sessions, asking them to return to the main meeting.
Participants can choose to return to the main meeting or stay in the breakout sessions.
Participants who return to the main meeting can rejoin the breakout sessions later, if the breakout sessions are still in progress.

  If you don't end the breakout sessions when you ask all to return, the participants' audio is muted when they return to the main meeting. Remind participants to unmute if they have something to say.
This feature is supported on Webex Meetings and Webex Webinars. On Webex App, this feature is available on our Video Mesh-ready meeting platform.
