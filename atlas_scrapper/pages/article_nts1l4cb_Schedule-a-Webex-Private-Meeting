Schedule a Webex Private Meeting
A Webex Private Meeting provides enhanced security by ensuring all participants belong to the same organization, are all on the corporate network, and the meeting content is local to your network and never in the cloud.
The following are required for Webex Private Meetings:
All participants in a Webex Private Meeting must belong to the organization hosting the private meeting (the host organization).
You must be connected to the corporate network of the host organization, either directly or through a VPN.
You can only join the Webex Private Meeting from the Webex app or from an authenticated video system in the host organization.
If your Webex app is connected to a video system, it must be an authenticated video system in the host organization.
For more information, see Cisco Webex Video Mesh Release Notes.

Personal Rooms cannot be used for Webex Private Meetings.
Webex Private Meetings are supported for scheduled meetings only.
Webex Private Meetings do not support Webex features that require a connection to the cloud, such as cloud recording, transcription, and Webex Assistant.
