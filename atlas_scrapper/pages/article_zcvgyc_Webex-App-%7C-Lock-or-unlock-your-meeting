Webex App | Lock or unlock your meeting
Keep uninvited people from joining your meeting by locking it after you start it. If you don't lock your meeting, anyone who has the meeting link can join it. When you lock a meeting, you can see who's waiting to join and let individual people in, or let everyone in at once.
You can lock or unlock Personal Room meetings and enhanced meetings associated with a space. Depending on your Webex site settings, you may be able to lock or unlock Webex scheduled meetings too.
