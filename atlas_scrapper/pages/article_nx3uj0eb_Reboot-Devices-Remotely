Reboot Devices Remotely
You can reboot room devices from Cisco Webex Control Hub remotely.
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com , go to Devices and select the device you want to reboot.
2
Click Actions and select Reboot from the drop-down menu. Confirm reboot in the pop-up window.
You can only reboot a device that is in idle state. If it’s in use, such as in a call or used for digital signage, the device doesn’t reboot.
