Webex App | Raise your hand in a meeting
If you have a question or comment during a Webex standard meeting, a Personal Room meeting, or an enhanced meeting associated with a space, raise your hand. The host and cohost are notified that you've raised your hand.
Choose the skin tone you prefer for the raise hand emoji.
You can sort the participants list to see everyone who has their hand raised.
If the host or cohost turns off the raise hand feature, you can't raise your hand.

During a meeting, click Raise hand .
A raised hand appears next to your name in the participants list, indicating to the host that you want to speak.
If the host muted you but now wants to let you speak, you're prompted to unmute yourself.
To lower your hand, click again.
