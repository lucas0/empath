Cisco Webex Modern View Support Matrix
You can use the Modern View support matrix to see which site types, service types, features, and more are available on your Cisco Webex site. This matrix shows the availability and status from the current update.

The planned update dates are subject to change. This matrix will be updated periodically.
The features that are called out in bold will no longer be available in the Meetings product after the WBS40.9 update to deprecate Classic View. This bold text also applies to slow channel customers using the Meetings product. Event and Training features will continue to be available through Classic View links.
