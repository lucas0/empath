Set up Room Navigator as a room booking device
A Room Navigator for wall mounting can be configured as a room booking device. It displays the room availability status and users can book impromptu meetings or see the room calendar.

Room booking is only available for shared devices.
Room booking is available for cloud registered devices.
Room booking is available for devices linked with Edge for Devices when cloud-managed software upgrade and "Allow Control Hub to manage configurations" is enabled.
To access the startup wizard for a previously configured Room Navigator, perform a factory reset.
To configure the Room Navigator for room booking, go through the startup wizard.
You need to set up the room device for booking in Control Hub. See Enable Room Booking For Shared Mode Webex Rooms for details.
1
Pair the touch controller to the room device as described in Connect Touch Controller to a Room Device or Webex Board Over the Network (LAN).
2
Set the Device type to Room Booking.


3
Select whether the Room Navigator is located inside or outside a room.



  This relates to how sensor data is collected and provided to Control Hub (such as temperature, humidity, air quality). When the device is located outside the room, the sensor data is not mixed with the sensor data from inside the room.
Room information
The Room Navigator shows information on room temperature, people count, and people presence in the room, if that is available from the device it's connected to.
The following configurations are enabled by default. You can disable or re-enable them from device configurations or xAPI. Read more about Device configurations. For detailed configuration descriptions, visit https://roomos.cisco.com/xapi.
Room temperature:
UserInterface RoomScheduler AmbientTemperature Show:
      <Auto/Hidden>
People count in the room:
UserInterface RoomScheduler PeopleCount Current:
      <Auto/Hidden>
To show people count, you must set:
RoomAnalytics PeopleCountOutOfCall: On
Standby WakeupOnMotionDetection: On
People count is used for room status indicator on the Room Navigator outside a meeting room.
People presence in the room:
UserInterface RoomScheduler StatusWhenInUse:
      <Auto/Free>
To show people presence, you must set:
RoomAnalytics PeoplePresenceDetector:
    <On/Off>
The device uses ultrasound and/or head detection to detect people in the workspace. One or both of these options needs to be set to On for the PeoplePrecenseDetector setting to work. Ultrasound and head detection can be turned on and off using these settings:
RoomAnalytics PeoplePresence Input HeadDetector: On/Off (default On)
RoomAnalytics PeoplePresence Input Ultrasound: On/Off (default Off)
To read more about sensors and which devices support these configurations, see Historical data for Webex Rooms workspaces.
Factory reset
You might need to perform a factory reset in order to pair the Room Navigator with a different room device or to configure it as a controller. You can factory reset the touch controller from the Settings menu.
To access the Settings menu on a Room Navigator in room booking mode, tap the screen three times with three fingers.
When you tap Factory Reset, you'll be asked to confirm your selection before the Room Navigator is restored to factory settings.
