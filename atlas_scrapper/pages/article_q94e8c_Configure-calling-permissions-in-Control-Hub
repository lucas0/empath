Configure calling permissions in Control Hub
In this article
You can change the outgoing or incoming calling permissions for a Webex Calling user or workspace, if you want them to be different from your organization's default. Changing these features for a specific user can be helpful, for example, if you want a user to be able to receive incoming collect calls, while continuing to block collect calls for the rest of your organization.
Outbound call types
This is a list of different outbound call types available for Webex Calling in the Control Hub:
Internal Calls—are calls within your own company. It includes calls to others within your own site and to other locations as well. You can choose to Allow, Block, require an Authorization Code, or Transfer to first, second, or third.
Toll Free Calls—are calls to a telephone number that is billed for all arriving calls instead of incurring charges to the originating caller, usually free of charge from a landline. You can choose to Allow, Block, require an Authorization Code, or Transfer to first, second, or third.
National Calls—are calls within your country of origin, both within and outside of your local area code. You can choose to Allow, Block, require an Authorization Code, or Transfer to first, second, or third.
International Calls—are calls to locations outside of your country that require an international calling code before the number is dialed (US, Canada, and Puerto Rico are an exception as calls among these countries aren’t treated as international currently). You can choose to Allow, Block, require an Authorization Code, or Transfer to first, second, or third.
Operator Assistance Calls—are any calls starting requiring Operator Assistance. You can choose to Allow, Block, require an Authorization Code, or Transfer to first, second, or third.
Chargeable Directory Assistance Calls—are calls to Directory Assistant companies that require a charge to connect the call. You can choose to Allow, Block, require an Authorization Code, or Transfer to first, second, or third.

Premium Services I and Premium Services II are used to provide information or entertainment for a fee charged directly to the caller. You can choose to Allow, Block, require an Authorization Code, or Transfer to first, second, or third.
