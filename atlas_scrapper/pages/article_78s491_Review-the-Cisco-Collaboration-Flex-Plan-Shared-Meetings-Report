Scroll to Meeting > SHARED MEETING USAGE , and then click View Report.
The report shows:
The actual number of concurrent meetings that occurred in your organization.
The number of allowed meetings refers to the number of concurrent meetings that your organization is entitled to and is equal to the number of Cloud Shared Meetings subscriptions purchased.
