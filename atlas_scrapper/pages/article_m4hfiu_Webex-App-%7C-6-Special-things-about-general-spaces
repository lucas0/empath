Webex App | 6 Special things about general spaces
When you get added to a team, you're automatically added to a unique General space, which has several special characteristics.
Every team includes the General space, and you can't rename it (even if you're a team moderator).
When team moderators add you to a team, you automatically get added to the General space.
Only team moderators can add you to General, because you get added to the team too.
You can't move General out of its associated team.
When you leave the General space, you leave the team.
Team moderators can convert the General space to an announcements-only space. This way, moderators can use the space to share important information, and everyone might be more likely to post messages in topic-specific spaces.
