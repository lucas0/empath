Configuration templates for Webex devices
With configuration templates you can create, save, export as a CSV file, and apply templates to individual or multiple devices.
Using configuration templates saves you time on configuring devices. You can write a description when you create the template. All the templates you've created are available on Control Hub and you can apply, edit, and copy them later on.
Limitations
Applying a template is a one time operation. If you edit a template, the configurations on the device it's applied to will not change. You must apply it to the device again for the configurations to be updated.
Possible performance issues when applying a template to many devices at once and when applying templates with many configurations.
Available for cloud registered devices and devices connected with Edge for Devices with Control Hub managed configurations enabled running RoomOS 11.1 or later.
