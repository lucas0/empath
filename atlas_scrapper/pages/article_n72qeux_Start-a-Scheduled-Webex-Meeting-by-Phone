Start a Scheduled Webex Meeting by Phone
If you're going to be away from your computer when you're supposed to host a meeting, you can dial into the meeting without signing in to the Webex Meetings app.
Before you begin
To start a meeting by phone, you need to save the phone number Webex Meetings uses to authenticate you, set a host PIN, and schedule your meeting with Webex Audio set as your connection type.
1
Open the email invite you received when you scheduled the meeting.
2
Under More ways to join, dial either the toll or toll-free number that is listed.
3
Enter the access code or the meeting number under Join by meeting number in the email invitation and press #.
4
When prompted, enter your host PIN and press #.
If you're calling from a phone that doesn't match the phone number that is saved in your Webex Audio and Video preferences, you're prompted to enter the saved phone number and press #. Then, you can enter your host PIN and press #.
