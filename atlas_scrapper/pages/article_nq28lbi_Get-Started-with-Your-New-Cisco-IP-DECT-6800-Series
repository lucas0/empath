Mount the Base Station or Repeater on the Ceiling
You can mount the base station or repeater on a ceiling. They use a custom ceiling mount bracket that you can install on the ceiling. You need to order the ceiling mount bracket.
Figure 1. Ceiling Mount Bracket
The base station and repeater have a range of up to 984 feet (300 meters) outdoors and a range of 164 feet (50 meters) indoors.
In this task, the term device means the base station or repeater.
Before you begin
You need:
Ceiling mount bracket
Pencil
Mounting hardware (screws and plugs) suitable for the ceiling construction.
Base station: LAN connection close to the mounting location.
Base station: If you do not use PoE, a power outlet close to the mounting location.
Repeater: A power outlet close to the mounting location.
Determine the best placement, taking into account the coverage area and the building construction materials.
If you have a 110 Single-Cell Base Station, you may need to add another 110 Single-Cell Base Station or additional 110 Repeaters.
If you have a 210 Multi-Cell Base Station, you may need to add additional base stations or repeaters.
You can use the site survey tool on the handset to plan the placement. See Perform a Site Survey for Your Cisco IP DECT 6800 Series.
1
Hold the ceiling mount bracket in the desired location.
2
Mark the screw placement.
3
Install the plugs as described by the manufacturer.
4
Install the screws through the bracket and into the plugs.
5
Base station only: Connect the Ethernet cable to the device and route the cable through the slot in the device.
6
Provide power to the device:
Base station with PoE on the LAN: Additional power is not required.
Base station without PoE: Plug the power adapter into the base station and route the cable through the slot in the base station.
Repeater: Plug the power adapter into the repeater and route the cable through the slot in the repeater.
7
Align the slots in the bracket with the slots in the device and turn left until the device locks in place.
This graphic shows the alignment of the mounting bracket to the base station. The back of the repeater is similar to the base station.
This diagram shows the way you turn the device to lock it into the mounting bracket.
8
Base station only: Plug the Ethernet cable into the LAN port.
9
If required, plug the power adapter into the electrical outlet.
If the base station LED lights green, it can connect to the network and start to download its configuration.
Mount the Base Station or Repeater on a Desk
You can place the base station or repeater on a desk or other horizontal surface (for example, a book shelf). Select a location where the base station or repeater won't be easily knocked off.
The base station and repeater have a range of up to 984 feet (300 meters) outdoors and a range of 164 feet (50 meters) indoors.
In this task, the term device means the base station or repeater.
Before you begin
You need:
Base station: LAN connection close to the mounting location.
Base station: If you do not use PoE, a power outlet close to the mounting location.
Repeater: A power outlet close to the mounting location.

If required, plug the power adapter into the electrical outlet.
If the base station LED lights green, it can connect to the network and start to download its configuration.
Mount the Base Station or Repeater on the Wall
You can mount the base station or repeater on a wall. You put two screws into the wall and slip the base station or repeater onto the screw heads or you can use the ceiling mount bracket.
We recommend that you mount the base station or repeater as high as possible on a wall. If possible, mount it at a downward facing angle for better radio coverage.
The base station and repeater have a range of up to 984 feet (300 meters) outdoors and a range of 164 feet (50 meters) indoors.
In this task, the term device means the base station or repeater.

You can use the site survey tool on the handset to plan the placement. See Perform a Site Survey for Your Cisco IP DECT 6800 Series.
1
Hold the level in the desired location and at least 2.25 inches (5.7 cm) below the ceiling, and draw a level line.
2
Mark the placement of the screws.
Without the ceiling mount bracket: Mark the line so that the screws are 2.126 inches (54 mm) apart (center to center).
With the ceiling mount bracket: Hold the bracket so that two of the holes intersect the line. Mark the holes.
3
Install the wall plugs as described by the manufacturer.
4
Insert the screws.
Without the ceiling mount bracket: Screw in the screws until there is about 0.375 inches (9.52 mm) between the screw head and the wall.
With the ceiling mount bracket: Hold the bracket over the holes and screw in the screws until the bracket doesn't move.
5
Base station only: Connect the Ethernet cable to the base station and route the cable through the slot in the base station.
6
Provide power to the device:
Base station with PoE on the LAN: Additional power is not required.
Base station without PoE: Plug the power adapter into the base station and route the cable through the slot in the base station.
Repeater: Plug the power adapter into the repeater and route the cable through the slot in the repeater.

If required, plug the power adapter into the electrical outlet.
If the base station LED lights green, it can connect to the network and start to download its configuration.
Find the Base Station IP Address
You use the handset to find the IP address of the base stations in your network. The handset displays the IP address of every base station within range.
If you have access to your router administration page, you can also use it to find the IP address.
Before you begin
You need these:
The base station needs to be connected into the network.
A handset needs to be available with a charged battery.
1
Press and hold Power/End until the screen turns on.
2
Press Menu .
3
Enter *47*.
Sign in to the Administration Web Page
You use the base station web page to configure the base station and handsets.

Contact your service provider to determine if you connect to the base station with HTTP or HTTPS. This procedure assumes that you use HTTP.
The web page signs you out after five minutes of inactivity.
Before you begin
You need the MAC and IP address of the base station.
The base station needs to be connected to the network and the green LED lit.
1
Find the IP address of the base station with Find the Base Station IP Address.
2
In a browser, enter the address of the base station.
Format:
http://<address>/main.html
where:
address is the IPv4 address of the base station.
Example
http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/main.html where xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is the IPv4 address.
Assign Handsets to Users
Your base station has been preconfigured with the handset information (for example, extension and user name).
When you set up multiple handsets, you need to assign each handset to a specific user. Each user has a unique phone number and voicemail box, and may have different features. You can assign individual access code to each handset with the Terminal web page fields or in the configuration file (.xml). You can set the access code this way in the configuration file:
<Subscr_Dect_Ac_Code_x_>nnnn</Subscr_Dect_Ac_Code_x_>
Where, x is the handset number and nnnn is the access code.
If the access code is more than 4 digits, only the first 4-digits are accepted.
To assign the handset to the user, you assign the International Portable Equipment Identity (IPEI) number of the handset to the correctly configured extension. The IPEI number for the handset is located in these locations:
On the label of the box that contained the handset
Under the handset battery
Before you begin
Connect to the base station web page as described in Sign in to the Administration Web Page.
The base station needs to be connected to the network and the green LED lit.
