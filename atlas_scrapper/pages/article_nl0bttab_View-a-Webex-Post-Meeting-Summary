View a Webex Post-Meeting Summary
After the meeting, hosts receive an email summary so they know who attended. The summary information will also be available on your Webex site.
When a host records a meeting, their post-meeting summary email includes a list of attendees ordered by duration, along with the time they joined, the duration, and the connection type.

If you stop recording during the meeting and then start recording again at a later time, another post-meeting summary email is generated.
Click View meeting content in the post-meeting summary email to sign in to your Webex site and get more complete participant information, such as the highlights, transcript, recording, and entire list of attendees.
