Webex App | Mark a message as unread
You can mark a message or a reply in a message thread, as unread so that you can come back to it later. This is helpful when you're switching spaces and want to remember where you left off.
Desktop
Mobile
Hover over the message, click More actions , and then click Mark as unread.
Everything from the message or message thread on is marked as unread. The space will still show your read receipt.
