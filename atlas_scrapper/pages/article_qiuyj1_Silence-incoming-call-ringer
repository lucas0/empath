Silence incoming call ringer
If you're busy or you don't want to be disturbed, you can silence the ringer when you receive an incoming call.
Silencing the ringer doesn't reject calls. If youâ€™ve configured the line to redirect no-answer calls to your voicemail, you can check the voice messages in the Recents list later.
Do one of the following actions when you have an incoming call:
Tap Ignore on the phone screen.
Then the incoming call that your ignored displays together with the animate icon on the phone home screen.
If your line receives multiple incoming calls, tap Ignore all to silence the ringer for all the incoming calls.

  The ring volume returns to normal with the next call.
Press - (volume down) on .
The ring volume doesn't return to normal with the next call. You must manually volume up the ringer.
