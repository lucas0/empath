Allow Participants to Share During Meetings
Administrators can allow participants to share during meetings hosted on their site. If allowed at the site level, hosts can choose whether to allow participants to share.
Site Administration
Webex Control Hub
After you enable participant sharing for your Webex sites, hosts can choose whether to allow participants to share in their meetings.
1
Sign in to Webex Site Administration and go to Configuration > Common Site Settings > Options.
2
In the Site Options section, check Allow Participants to Share in meetings (Meetings only).
When you uncheck this check box, the following settings arenâ€™t available:
The first attendee to join will be the presenter (when scheduling a meeting)
Anyone Can Share (in the host's Participant menu during a meeting)
When you uncheck this check box, attendees can share if the host assigns them the Presenter role.
