Switch your view in Webex Meetings and from a mobile device
When you're in a meeting, webinar, or event, use the video layout views to engage with fellow participants and stay focused on the speaker or shared content.
These layouts are available for Meetings, Webex Webinars, and Webex Events (classic).
The views that are available to switch to depends on your device, the orientation of your device, how many people are in the meeting, webinar, or event, and whether or not anyone shares content. There are advantages to using each of these views.
You can select from the following views:
Grid view—Useful when you want to divide your attention across a lot of speakers in a large meeting.
Equal view—Useful for one-on-one conversations or small meetings with only a few others.
Stack view—Useful when you want to focus on the active speaker or shared content but also want to see other participants.
Focus view—Useful for when you want to see the active speaker or shared content full-screen.
The maximum number of participants that can connect to a meeting with high definition video quality is 1000 and with standard video quality it's 1000. For information about the maximum capacity for meetings, webinars, and events, see What is the maximum number of participants in a Webex session or call?
