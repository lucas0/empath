Configure Meetings, Events, and Training Options for Your Education Provisioned Cisco Webex Site
As the admin of an education (EDU) provisioned Webex site, you can customize meetings, events, and training sessions around the needs of the instructors and students in your organization.
We created a list of our recommended site settings for EDU sites so that you can quickly apply them to yours. There are common site settings, which apply to Webex meetings, events, and training sessions. There are also settings specific to each of them. Customizing these settings helps make sure that teachers are always in control of their virtual classes. It also helps students stay focused and engaged.

When you apply these settings, they become the default behavior for meetings, events, and training sessions on your site. Hosts can change some of these settings for scheduled meetings on their accounts. These changes don't affect the site default.
