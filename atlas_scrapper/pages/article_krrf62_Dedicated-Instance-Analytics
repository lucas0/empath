Dedicated Instance Analytics
In this article
Analytics in Control Hub allows the administrators to access interactive data visualizations that show important information, such as usage and adoption trends. Explore data as it automatically adapts to parameters that you specify in real time.
Dedicated Instance Analytics
The Dedicated Instance Analytics and visualization capabilities allows you to monitor the overall call quality and details of the end-point usage. The Dedicated Instance Analytics visualization and reports gives partners and customers insight into the setup, efficiency, and overall use of their calling devices. Partners and customers can use this insight and reports to drive their decisions.
As a full administrator, read-only administrator, or support administrator of an organization, you have access to various reports in Control Hub, depending on your deployment. You can use this information to evaluate how Dedicated Instance services and devices are being used in your organization and how often. You can use analytics to track and measure services in your cloud collaboration portfolio.
You can export these reports as a PDF, PNG, or CSV.

The following are a few of the use cases for setting max concurrent calls:
MGCP Gateway: The maximum capacity can be set based on the line terminations on gateways.
For example, if the MGCP gateway is configured with T1, and all the 24 ports are configured in CUCM, then the maximum capacity can be set to 24.
Inter Cluster Trunk: The maximum call capacity of the trunk can be set based on the WAN capacity, the allocated bandwith for Audio/Video/Data, the codec in use, and so on.
SIP Trunk: The maximum call capacity of the trunk can be set based on the purchased call limit for the trunk as per the agreement.
Expressway Trunk: The maximum call capacity of the trunk can be set based on the capacity of Expressway nodes or cluster.
The Trunk Peak Utilization table displays the following details:

Peak Utilization %
Peak utilization in percentage. Peak utilization is calculated as the ratio of Peak calls and Maximum concurrent calls.
Actions
Allowed options for the trunk
If you have a valid account and required credentials to Control Hub, then you can access the Analytics page through Site Administration.

The charts show data in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
If Dedicated Instance is upgraded from version X to version Y, then both versions are displayed in the Analytics charts. The latest data is shown under Dedicated Instance Version against the latest upgraded version. However, the calls that are counted against the previous version continues to show for the selected duration.
When the Cluster ID is changed, then the Analytics Cluster drop-down list shows the updated Cluster name from next day onwards. The detailed view charts in both service experience and asset usage Dedicated Instance Cluster chart shows the latest cluster name. The older cluster name continues to show and represent the previously processed call count.
Analytics now supports user filters.
You can use the user filters such as the User ID, URI, and Phone Number to filter the various charts in Analytics. If the Data Collection Agreement hasn't been accepted yet through any other service, clicking on these filters would provide you an option to review and accept the agreement.
This information is also available in downloaded data for the Service Experience and Asset Usage charts.
Analytics now supports Calling Number and Called Number charts as well.
The customer admin must change the required PII setings for user filter support as well as the charts representing Calling Number and Called Number.
