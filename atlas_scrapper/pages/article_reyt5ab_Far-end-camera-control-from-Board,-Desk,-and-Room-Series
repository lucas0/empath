Far-end camera control from Board, Desk, and Room Series
When you're in a video call where one or more of the other devices have a remotely controllable camera, you can control those cameras from your own touch controller or device.
If the far-end device has activated Speaker mode where the camera follows the active speaker or is using Best View, you can't control the camera remotely.
You don’t have remote access to any camera presets.

For Webex Edge for Devices linked devices, far-end camera control is available in Webex meetings when Webex Optimized Experience is enabled.
You can't control the camera on a DX70 or DX80.
You can't control the camera of a device registered in personal mode.
1
During a call, open the Participants list.
2
Select the one whose camera you want to control and tap Control camera.
3
Adjust the remote camera's tilt, pan, and zoom with the camera control buttons. Tap anywhere outside the buttons when you’re done.
