Devices and the Number of Line Buttons Available
Save yourself time and effort by familiarizing yourself with how many line buttons are actually available on your device before you start adding features to them. For example, if you have a Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series and create 5 speed dial numbers but you only have 3 free line buttons on your phone, only 3 speed dial numbers can be used.

  Keep in mind that you'll have to deduct 1 from each of the values above because one line is already assigned as a directory number.
