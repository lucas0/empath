Legal Notice about pronouns in Webex
Legal Notice about pronouns in Webex
Cisco’s purpose is to Power an Inclusive Future for All. When we say "all," we mean everyone, including communities across all gender identities. At the same time, we recognize that for some of our users, it may not be or feel safe to share your pronouns. Sharing your pronouns in Webex is entirely voluntary – if you choose to make your pronouns visible, you can change the visibility to the default setting "hidden" at any time. If you feel unsafe sharing this information, we suggest you do not select or input your pronouns and leave the setting as "hidden." If you choose to use the pronouns feature in Webex, your personal pronouns will be visible in (i) your contact card, (ii) headers in direct message spaces, (iii) your contacts profile, (iv) your profile menu, and (v) People Insights.
If you are a free user of the Webex App, you acknowledge and consent that by setting your pronoun visibility to "Everyone," Webex App users and participants in any Webex Meetings or Webinars will be able to see your personal pronouns in the areas listed above.
If you are an enterprise user, you acknowledge and consent that by setting your pronouns visibility to "People in my organization," your personal pronouns will be visible to all users in your organization in the areas listed above.
Please note that any changes to the visibility status of pronouns will not apply retroactively. For example, if your pronouns status was set to "Visible" and you attended a Webex Meeting that was recorded, a subsequent change to your pronouns visibility to "Hidden" will not remove the pronouns that were visible in the previous Webex Meeting recording.
