Manage User Accounts in Webex Site Administration
In this article
Site administrators can add, edit, or deactivate users, assign different account types, and enable site-wide account settings.
User Account Types
There are a few types of user accounts and each allows users to do different things:
User Account Type
Description
Host
Allows users to host Webex sessions.
Site Administrator
Allows users to host sessions and use Site Administration.
Partial Site Admin
View only - Allows users to view, but not change, information in Site Administration.
User management - Allows users to perform administration activities pertaining only to adding, editing, or removing users.
Attendee only
Allows users to sign in to your Webex to attend meetings, maintain a personal profile, and to view the meetings list.
Note: Attendees do not need attendee accounts to attend Webex sessions unless the host requires that they have an account.
If your Webex contract provides the concurrent license option, you can add any number of user accounts. Your contract limits the number of users who can simultaneously host or attend sessions. If you have questions about concurrent licenses, contact your Webex account manager.
If your organization has enabled the account sign-up option, users can request new accounts by completing an account sign-up form on your Webex service site.
If you enable the feature, users can request accounts from your Webex site.
You can also add individual or multiple user accounts from Site Administration.
