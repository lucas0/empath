Move participants to the stage in meetings, webinars, and events
When you use stack or side by side view, the active speaker or shared content appears as the main video, called the stage. Customize what you see on the stage by adding up to eight additional participants to it. If the meeting includes an interpreter you can add them to the stage along with the active speaker.

  This feature is not available for webinars in webcast view.
Up to eight participants can appear on the stage at any given time. So, if the host or cohost syncs their stage and adds participants to it, you can only add more participants if one or more of the slots on the stage is available. To learn more about stage view, see Video layouts in Webex Meetings, Webex Webinars and Webex Events (classic) or Webex App | Change your video layout during a meeting.
