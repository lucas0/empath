Get a post-meeting transcript by recording your meeting or webinar
If you're the host, you can get a transcript of the meeting or webinar if you record the meeting in the cloud. The transcript will be available on your Webex site after the meeting or webinar. You can play audio clips of the transcript, download it, make edits, and share it with others.
Webex Assistant is available in Webex Meeting.
Beginning with the 41.5 update, it is also available in Webex Webinarswebinar mode.
In addition to Meetings and Webex Webinars, with the 41.7 update, Webex Assistant is also available for the Webex App. Classic meetings started or joined from a space don't support Webex Assistant. In Webex App, you can also download a transcript without recording the meeting.
