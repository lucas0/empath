Configure Idle Session Timeout for Control Hub Users
You can specify the amount of time that a Cisco Webex Control Hub user's session will stay idle before they're automatically signed out. This setting applies to Control Hub administrators and users in your organization. This setting doesn't apply to Webex Meetings or Webex users.
Actions taken in one browser tab don't affect the idle timer of the window or tab that has Control Hub open. Users must be active in each window or tab with Control Hub open within the time set or they will be signed out.
The available values that you can set for an idle session timeout are:
10 minutes.
20 minutes â€“ This is the default amount of time that Control Hub sessions can remain idle.
40 minutes.
1 hour.
2 hours.
4 hours.
8 hours.
12 hours.

Sign in to Control Hub, and go to Management > Organization Settings, and scroll to the Idle Timeouts section.
