Webex App | View call history
Missed a call in Webex App and want to see who it was? Or, you might need an easy way to get back to someone you've talked to before. Go to your call history where you can see up to 200 of the calls you've made, received, and missed in the last 30 days.
You can see if someone called you from their work or mobile number, and then call them back at the same number. If there isn't a number under the person's name, it was a Webex App call.
When a call is forwarded or redirected, Webex App shows information on the caller, and where it was forwarded or redirected from. This includes calls forwarded or redirected from hunt groups, call center queues, and executive assistants.
If you're set up with Webex Calling or your calling is hosted by a Service Provider, your call history synchronizes across your desktop and mobile apps as well as your desk phone.
