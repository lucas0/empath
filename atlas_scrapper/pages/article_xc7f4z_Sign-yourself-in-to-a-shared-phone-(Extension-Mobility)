Sign yourself in to a shared phone (Extension Mobility)
This Help article is for Cisco Video Phone 8875 registered to Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM).
The extension mobility feature allows you to log in to any IP phone in your organization and use it as if it were your own. This feature is useful if you often move between different offices or workstations.
When you log in to an IP phone using the extension mobility feature, the phone retrieves your personal settings such as speed dials, phone directory, call history, and voicemail settings.
Once you sign out of the phone, your personal settings are automatically removed from the phone.

  Depending on the settings on the shared phone, you may find the EM feature as a feature button, a feature shortcut on the Shortcuts tab, or a menu item under Settings > Customized services.
