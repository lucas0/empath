Close a Q&A session in Slido
As a Webex Meetings or Webex Webinars host, if you don't want to receive any more questions, close your Q&A. The participants can't submit any new questions but you can still discuss and display previously submitted questions.
Slido is available in Webex Meetings. You can use Slido in plans for up to 10,000 users in Webex Webinars on version 41.9 and later sites. Slido polls are available for up to 10,000 attendees, while quizzes are available for up to 5,000 users.
Participants can still vote for questions after you close the session.
