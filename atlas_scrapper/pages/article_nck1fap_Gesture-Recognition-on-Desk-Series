Gesture Recognition on Desk Series
Raise your hand, clap, or give a thumbs up or down in front of your Desk series device to let others know you have a question or react, without interrupting the conversation.
Gesture Recognition is not available in meetings started from a Webex space. Reactions are visible on the Webex apps and on devices that support this feature. You can also see if someone has reacted on the Webex apps.

Gesture Recognition is off by default. You can turn it on during a meeting by tapping the React button in the call control and toggle on Recognize gestures .

The meeting's participants see an on-screen notification that someone has raised their hand. The notification with a full name shows up for the first raised hand.
