Webex Meetings VDI Release Notes
Audio and video for meetings requires significant bandwidth, and can cause a bottleneck going through the data center. Cisco Webex Meetings Virtual Desktop Software provides an enhanced experience in virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) environments. The VDI software consists of the Webex Meetings app on the hosted virtual desktops (HVD) and the plugin on the thin clients. The software routes audio and video streams between the thin client and Webex Meetings cloud, without going through the HVD in the datacenter.
