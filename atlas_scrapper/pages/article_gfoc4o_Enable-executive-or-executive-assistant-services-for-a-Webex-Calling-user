Enable executive or executive assistant services for a Webex Calling user
In this article
You can turn-on executive or executive assistant services for a Webex Calling user in Control Hub. Users with the executive service enabled select from a pool of assistants who have been assigned the executive assistant service and who can answer, or place calls on their behalf. Executive assistants can set the call forward destination, and join or leave an executiveâ€™s pool. Executive and executive assistant settings are managed in the Calling User Portal.
Enable executive or executive assistant services

  Executive and executive assistants must have phone numbers, not just extensions, assigned to them.
