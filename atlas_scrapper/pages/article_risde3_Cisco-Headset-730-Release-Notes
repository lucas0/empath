You can toggle some or all of these settings with the Cisco Headsets app, on a Cisco IP Phone (phone firmware 12.8(1) or later), or in Cisco Jabber (version 12.9 or later).

  Smart sensors are On by default on Cisco IP Phones and in Cisco Jabber. In the Cisco Headsets app, smart sensors are Off by default.
For more information, see Cisco Headset 730 Smart Sensors.
Headset Inventory Through the Cisco Headset USB HD Adapter
When connected to the USB HD Adapter, the Cisco Headset 730 appears in the Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) and Webex Control Hub headset inventory. Previously, only the USB HD Adapter appeared in headset inventory.

  You must have USB HD Adapter firmware version 1-2-33 or later to use this feature.
For more information on headset inventory in Control Hub, see Headset Administration in Cisco Webex Control Hub.
For information on headset inventory in Cisco Unified CM, see the Cisco Headset 700 Series Administration Guide.
Multi-App Control
This firmware version offers users an improved call control experience when you use multiple Cisco desktop calling applications at the same time. For example, you can mute an active call in Cisco Webex and then answer an incoming Cisco Jabber call through the Jabber UI. While you are on the Jabber call, call controls through the headset only impact Jabber. When the Jabber call is complete, you can resume your Webex call and maintain call control through your headset.
Previously, headset call controls would occasionally impact all open calling applications at once.

  Active calls don't automatically hold when you answer an incoming call on a different application. Be sure to hold or mute a call on one application before you answer an incoming call on a different calling app.
This release only enables multi-app control between Cisco Webex, Webex Meetings, and Cisco Jabber (version 12.9 or later) over BluetoothÂ® or with the USB cable. Partial multi-app functionality is available with Microsoft Teams through the USB cable.
Microsoft Teams Support
The Cisco Headset 730 supports call controls on the most recent version of Microsoft Teams. Call controls are available through the USB cable.
You can:
Answer and end calls
Hold and resume calls
