Formulae
Supervisor Desktop
Analyzer
Average Service Level
The computation excludes those calls that were queued but not connected to an agent, as the call got disconnected prior to connecting to an agent. Such disconnected calls might not have met the service level agreement (SLA) if they were connected to agents.
The computation includes those calls that were queued but not connected to an agent, as the call got disconnected prior to connecting to an agent. Such disconnected calls might not have met the SLA if they were connected to agents.
Longest Contact Currently in Queue
This value is computed based on the actual time for which a contact is available in a queue.
This value is computed based on the time at which the contact arrived at the contact center. The time spent by the contact in Interactive Voice Response (IVR) before joining the queue is also included in the computation.
Average Handled Time
Hold time is included in the computation of this value.
Hold time isn't included in the computation of this value.
Total Contacts Handled
This computation includes all calls queued and connected to an agent successfully.
This computation excludes a certain category of calls that are connected to an agent but aren’t normally ended.
Total Contacts Abandoned
This computation includes all calls that are queued but ended before they are connected to an agent.
Calls that end during IVR and prior to getting queued aren’t included.
In addition to calls that are queued but ended before they are connected to an agent, this computation includes a certain category of calls that are connected to an agent but aren’t normally ended.
Calls that end during IVR and prior to getting queued are also included.
Data latency
The table below compares latency for data to refresh between the KPI cards in Supervisor Desktop and the corresponding KPI cards in Analyzer:
Supervisor Desktop
Analyzer
Events are published in real-time as this is push-based architecture.
As this is a pull-based architecture, the Analyzer UI sends requests to extract data and displays it.
The refresh interval ranges from 5 seconds to 60 seconds based on the report.
