Compare Webex Webinars and Webex Events (classic)
Webex Webinars (formerly Webex Events (new)) includes webinars with either an interactive and highly engaging experience, or a webcast view with limited attendee interactions, as well as many of the advanced features you’re familiar with from Webex Meetings. Events (classic) remains available on your site if your plan supports up to 3000 users. Use this article to help you decide which webinar or event service to use based on your needs. See what’s available now, and check back to see what’s enhanced in future updates.
