Add and manage a Webex site in Control Hub
You can configure and manage Webex sites in Control Hub. You can add and delete Webex sites, and redistribute licenses from old Webex sites to new ones.
This article is focused on site administrators, who manage enterprise accounts. If you have a personal account for Webex Meetings, see manage my account for more information.
General Limitations
Webex site management, such as adding, deleting, or editing, will be unavailable until the pending action for a Webex site is complete.
Pending actions typically take up to 24 hours to complete, but may take longer.
We recommend that you don't perform any user management related tasks until the pending action for a Webex site is completed.
Add a Webex site in Control Hub
You can add Webex sites in Control Hub, and decide if you want to manage your users in Webex Site Administration or in Control Hub.
If you purchased Webex services from a partner, contact the partner if you want to manage the Webex site in Control Hub.
1
Sign in to Control Hub.
2
In the left navigation pane under Services, click Meeting.
3
Click Add Site.
4
Choose the subscription to add your new site to, and select Next.
5
Click Next.
6
Enter the site name, time zone, and choose where you want to manage your users.

  To ensure that your site receives access to features before the normal deployment cycle, select the checkbox for Set up Webex site for early release. You can't change this setting later.
7
Select Add Site and then choose Next.

  Choose the time zone where most of your users are.
8
Distribute licenses across sites, and then select Save.
Delete a Webex site in Control Hub
You can delete Webex sites managed in Control Hub. You must have at least one Webex site associated with your subscription.

  Sites with only Basic Meetings can't be deleted. You can set up a license template if you want to manage access on who receives a Basic Meetings license.

  When you delete a Webex site, make sure to take note that:
You lose all the recordings that are associated with that site. It's a good idea to download Webex recordings before deleting your site.
Scheduled meetings on that site won't work anymore. You need to educate your users to use a different or new Webex site for their meetings.

In the left navigation pane under Services, click Meeting.
