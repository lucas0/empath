Webex App | Turn off the participants list
As a meeting host or cohost, you can limit who can see the participants list. If you want to keep the list private, turn it off. Then, only the host, the cohosts, and the presenter see it.
Use the participants list to manage participants in the meeting.
This feature is available on our Video Mesh-ready meeting platform. Find out if your meetings use the Video Mesh-ready meeting platform.
