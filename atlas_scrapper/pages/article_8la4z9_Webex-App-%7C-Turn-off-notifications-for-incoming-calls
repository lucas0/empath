Webex App | Turn off notifications for incoming calls
You can turn off the ringing sound and notification that pops up when someone is calling you directly. You might want to do this if you donâ€™t want to receive work calls on your mobile. Or maybe you don't want to be distracted when you're in a meeting.
When you make changes they only apply to that device. For example, if you mute incoming call notifications on Windows, you'll continue to get notifications on your Android.
Windows
Mac
iPhone and iPad
Android

When you choose this option, you also can Automatically decline all incoming calls. Calls are declined on all your devices.
