Webex App | Switch your call to your mobile Phone app
When you're on call in Webex App on your mobile device, you can take your call on the move. Just switch your call from Webex App to your mobile Phone app, all while maintaining connectivity and call quality.
Your administrator must enable this feature for your mobile phone number but you can change that number anytime from your Advanced Call Settings.
1
During a call, tap More and select Switch to <number>.
You receive an incoming call on your mobile Phone app. There will be a short pause in your call while you make the switch, so you may want to give the person you're talking to a heads up.
2
Answer the incoming call on your mobile Phone app and continue with your conversation.
The call in Webex App automatically disconnects.
