Access call controls on mobile with the Webex App call widget
When youâ€™re on a call, the widget provides you with quick access to call controls. The widget is always visible outside of the app giving you additional access to manage calls while multi-tasking.
You can use this feature with Webex Go or a mobile network operator (MNO) that has call signaling using Cisco call control for your mobile phone calls.
Before you begin
The first time you use the widget, you must allow the widget to display over other apps. You can also choose this in the Webex App settings on your mobile device Settings > Apps > Webex > Appear on top (or Display over other apps) > Allow permission.
