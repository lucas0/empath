Replace your Cisco Headset 730 ear pads
Follow these steps to replace your worn out ear pads.
The ear pads on your headset are an important part of your experience. They provide comfort, grip, and isolate your headset audio. With time, it's natural for ear pads to wear out, but you can replace them easily.
1
Grip the old ear pad firmly in your hand, press down, and rotate it counterclockwise.
2
Pull the old ear pad away from the speaker.
3
Align the notches on the headset with the pins on the inside of the new ear pad.
4
Place the ear pad on the headset. Be sure that the ear pad pins are flush with the notches on the headset.
5
Grip your headset, firmly press the new ear pad down, and turn clockwise until you hear the pins click into place.
