Network Requirements for Webex Services
Network Requirements for Webex Services
Document Revision History
 
This article is intended for network administrators, particularly firewall and proxy security administrators who want to use Webex messaging and meetings services within their organization. It will help you configure your network to support the Webex Services used by HTTPS based Webex app and Webex Room devices, as well as Cisco IP Phones, Cisco video devices, and third-party devices that use SIP to connect to the Webex Meetings service.
This document primarily focuses on the network requirements of Webex cloud registered products that use HTTPS signaling to Webex cloud services, but also separately describes the network requirements of products that use SIP signaling to join Webex Meetings. These differences are summarized below:

Webex traffic through Proxies and Firewalls
Most customers deploy an internet firewall, or internet proxy and firewall, to restrict and control the HTTP based traffic that leaves and enters their network. Follow the firewall and proxy guidance below to enable access to Webex services from your network. If you are using a firewall only, note that filtering Webex signaling traffic using IP addresses is not supported, as the IP addresses used by Webex signaling services are dynamic and may change at any time. If your firewall supports URL filtering, configure the firewall to allow the Webex destination URLs listed in the section "Domains and URLs that need to be accessed for Webex Services".

Webex signaling traffic and Enterprise Proxy Configuration
Most organizations use proxy servers to inspect and control the HTTP traffic that leaves their network. Proxies can be used to perform several security functions such as allowing or blocking access to specific URLs, user authentication, IP address/domain/hostname/URI reputation lookup, and traffic decryption and inspection. Proxy servers are also commonly used as the only path that can forward HTTP based internet destined traffic to the enterprise firewall, allowing the firewall to limit outbound internet traffic to that originating from the Proxy server(s) only. Your Proxy server must be configured to allow Webex signaling traffic to access the domains/ URLs listed in the section below:

Additional URLs for Webex Hybrid Services








Your Proxy server must be configured to allow Webex signaling traffic to access the domains/ URLs listed in the previous section.  Support for additional proxy features relevant to Webex services is discussed below:
