Does the Cisco WebEx Meetings App for iOS Support Whiteboard Share?
Does the Cisco WebEx Meetings App for iOS support Whiteboard share?
What are the limitation of Whiteboard sharing in the Cisco Webex Meetings for iOS?
 Cisco Webex Meetings for iOS v39.1
Beginning with the Cisco Webex Meetings for iOS v39.1 the Whiteboard share feature is supported.
If the Whiteboard share feature is unavailable, contact your Site Administrator to get the 'Whiteboard' feature enabled on the 'Session Type'.

The iOS 'Whiteboard' feature differs in behavior from the whiteboard functionality on desktop clients. Therefore, whiteboard related settings in the Desktop client will not apply to iOS whiteboard file users.
The app uses share image file technology to start the whiteboard share and stores in the device Photos.

Note: The Whiteboard share feature is not supported in Webex Events.
