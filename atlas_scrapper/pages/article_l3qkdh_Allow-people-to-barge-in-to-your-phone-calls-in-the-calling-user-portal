Allow people to barge in to your phone calls in the calling user portal
If your administrator has enabled the Barge-In feature for you, you can allow others to answer your incoming calls or drop in on your phone calls. You can also choose whether to make the phone play a tone when someone barges into a call.
Before you begin
Your administrator has enabled Barge In for you.
1
Go to https://settings.webex.com, select Webex Calling.
You're brought to the calling user portal.
2
Go to Call Settings, and select Additional Features.
3
Turn on Barge-in if you don't mind others dropping in on your calls. Then, decide whether you want to play a warning tone, letting you know when someone is joining your call.
