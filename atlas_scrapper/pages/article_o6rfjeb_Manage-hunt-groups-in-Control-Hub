Manage hunt groups in Control Hub
In this article
You can use hunt groups to ensure that all of your incoming calls are answered by the right people or routed to voicemail for later response. Hunt groups route incoming calls to specific employees in a predetermined pattern. This is done by assigning a phone number to a group of employees and then setting rules that define how the call is answered, how long the call remains on hold, and who to forward the call to.
Create a hunt group
Before you begin
You may want to set up hunt groups in the following scenarios:
A Sales team that wants sequential routing. An incoming call rings one phone, but if there's no answer, the call goes to the next hunt group member in the list.
A Support team that wants phones to ring all at once so that the first available member can take the call.

For customers in the Asia-Pacific region, the Caller ID Name field is auto-populated with the User Name. You cannot modify the Caller ID Name field.
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Services, and choose Calling > Features.
2
Click Hunt Group > Create Hunt Group.
3
In the Basics tab, enter the following information:
Location—Select a location from the drop-down.

  A location is a container with location-specific calling configuration. See Configure Cisco Webex Calling for Your Organization for more information.
Hunt Group Name—Enter a name for the hunt group.
Phone Number—Assign a primary phone number and/or an extension to the hunt group.
Caller ID—Assign the Caller ID for the hunt group. Caller ID is used for calls that are forwarded outside of this hunt group.
Language—Select the hunt group language in the drop-down menu.
4
Click Next.
5
In the Call Routing tab, choose one of the following options:
Circular (Max 1,000 agents)—This option cycles through all members after the last member that took a call. It sends calls to the next available hunt group member.
Top Down (Max 1,000 agents)—Send the call through the queue of members in order, starting from the top each time.
Longest Idle (Max 1,000 agents)—Sends calls to the member that has been idle the longest. If they don't answer, proceed to the next member who has been idle second longest, and so on until the call is answered.
Weighted (Max 100 agents)—Sends call to idle members based on percentages you assign to each member of the hunt group (up to 100%).
Simultaneous (Max 50 agents)—Sends calls to all members in a call queue at once.
6
You can check the Advance after a set number of rings check box and use the drop-down to select the number of rings to apply to your call routing choice, if required.
7
Click Next.
8
On the Routing Settings tab, you can enable one or more of the following options, if required:
Advance when busy—The hunt group won't ring members when they are on another call, and advances to the next member in the hunt group. If the member has call waiting enabled and the call is advanced to them, then the call waits until the member becomes idle again.
Forward after a set number of rings—Unanswered calls after a defined number of rings forwards to a designated number.
Divert calls when unreachable—Unanswered calls divert to a defined phone number. This could apply to phone calls that aren't answered due to a network outage, or all members of the hunt group are busy and the Advance when busy option is also enabled.

  For users only using a mobile device, calls won't be diverted, if there is a network outage.
9
Click Next.
10
In the Select Agents tab, search and add users, workspaces, or virtual lines to the call list.

  Depending on which Call Routing option you chose previously, you need to add extra information such as adding percentage weighting to users, workspaces or virtual lines, or in the case of circular call routing, drag and drop users, workspaces, or virtual lines in the order of their queue position.
11
Click Next.
12
In the Review tab, you get a chance to review your hunt group settings to make sure you've entered the correct details.
13
Click Next and Done to confirm your hunt group settings.
