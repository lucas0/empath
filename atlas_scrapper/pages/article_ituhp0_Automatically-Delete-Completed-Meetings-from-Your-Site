Automatically Delete Completed Meetings from Your Site
You don't have to retain old scheduled meetings, training sessions, and events on your site if you're ready to delete them. By default, completed meetings automatically get deleted after 90 days, but you can choose the time period that works best for your users. This setting applies to scheduled meetings, training sessions, and events. It does not apply to recurring meetings.
