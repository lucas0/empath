View recent calls on your multiplatform phone
In this article
You can access your most recent calls for placed, answered, and missed calls directly from your phone.
Recent calls list
Use the Recents list to see the 180 most recent individual calls and call groups.
If your Recents list reaches the maximum size, the next new entry overwrites the oldest entry in the list.
When STIR/SHAKEN support is implemented on the server, the phone displays an extra icon next to the caller ID based on the caller's STIR/SHAKEN verification result. Based on the verification result, the phone displays three types of icons. For more information on the icons, see View your Recent Calls.
View your Recent Calls
Check to see who's called you recently.

Each line has missed call badging. You can view the number of missed calls per line on the phone screen. The maximum missed call badge is 99. When you view either the All calls or Missed calls list on the phone screen for a particular line, the missed call badge for the selected line gets cleared.
The missed call badge and the actual number of missed calls may be different due to a display limit of 180 calls for the Recents list. This limit consists of outgoing calls, missed calls, and incoming calls. Also, there can be some old missed calls that get added to the count for the missed call badge. This can get overwritten in the Recents list.
