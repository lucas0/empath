View Active Directory groups in Control Hub
When your company uses Active Directory (AD), you can view your AD groups in Control Hub.
When you sync users and groups from your Active Directory to Webex with Cisco Directory Connector, you can view these groups and their members directly in Control Hub.
There are two different types of groups in Active Directory:
Security groups—used to assign permissions to shared resources.
Distribution groups—used to create email distribution lists.

  While you can synchronize both security groups and distribution groups to Control Hub, you can apply settings templates, policies and features to security groups only. Distribution groups are intended for use when sending mass communications.
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Users and click Groups.
You can also apply the following policies to specific security groups:
Prevent people from sharing files
Remove the GIPHY Integration from Webex
Remove Previews for Website Links in Webex
