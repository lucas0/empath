Find your Webex recordings
Webex stores all your recorded meetings either locally on your computer or onUser Hub. Access your recordings and share or download them from User Hub. If it's not your meeting, reach out to the host of your meeting to get the recording.
About your recording
As a host, you may access the recording in the Recordings tab on the Meetings page.
As an attendee, you receive access to a meeting recording from the host of the meeting. Look for an email from the host with a link to access the recording file. You can also see how you can contact the host of your meeting.

  Only the host or a cohost can record a meeting. You can't record if the recording option doesn't appear in the meeting controls. If the cohost records the meeting, the meeting host still receives and owns the recording after the meeting ends.
For more information on how your recordings are saved, see Webex | Record a meeting.

  If you subscribe to Webex from your Service Provider and do not see these options, please contact your Providerâ€™s customer support team for more information about the recording options available.
