People Insights Profiles for Webex App, Meetings, and Webex Webinars in Control Hub
You can show or hide the public information in People Insights profiles for the Webex App app, Webex Meetings, and Webex Webinars webinar mode in Control Hub. Each user's profile can include their title, work history, social media links, and Active Directory information.
Overview
People Insights profiles may contain publicly available information, similar to what can be found in search engine results for a person’s name. Users have control over any public information that appears on their profiles. Administrators can choose to show or hide that public information from users within their organization.
It may take up to 48 hours for your users to see People Insights profiles after this is enabled.
Show or Hide Public Information from Users in your Organization
People Insights profiles are available to see by default, but you can choose to hide public information from users in your organization.
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Organization Settings and scroll down to the People Insights section.
2
Toggle the switch on to show or off to hide public information in Public Insights profiles under Show Public Data.
What to do next
To display your organization’s Active Directory information within People Insights profiles, enable directory synchronization.
After directory synchronization is enabled, the following Active Directory fields will populate People Insights profiles:
Address: City and country are required to display the time zone and weather.
Title: Improves the quality of public information displayed in profiles.
Manager: Ensures that your internal reporting structure displays to users within your organization.
