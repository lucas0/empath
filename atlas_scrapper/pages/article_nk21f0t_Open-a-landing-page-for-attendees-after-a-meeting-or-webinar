Open a landing page for attendees after a meeting or webinar
Keep your attendees engaged after Webex Meetings or Webex Webinars. As the host, you can enter a URL that automatically sends attendees to a landing page after the meeting or webinar ends, or after they complete the post-webinar survey. This could be an invitation to another meeting or webinar, a thank you page, or other web page.

  This feature is not available for webinars in webcast view.
