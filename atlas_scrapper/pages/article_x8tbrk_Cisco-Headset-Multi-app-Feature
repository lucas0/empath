Cisco Headset Multi-app Feature
You can maintain headset call controls when you have more than one open calling application on your desktop.
All Cisco Headset models can retain call control features when there is more than one open calling client on your Windows or Mac desktop. Instead of broadcasting a button press to all open applications, headset controls only impact one calling application at a time.
For example, you can mute an active call in the Webex app and then answer an incoming Cisco Jabber call through the Jabber UI. While youâ€™re on the Jabber call, call controls through the headset only impact Jabber. When the Jabber call is complete, you can resume your Webex call and maintain call control through your headset.

Keep the following in mind when you have multiple calling apps open on your desktop:
Active calls don't automatically hold when you answer an incoming call on a different application. Be sure to hold or mute a call on one application before you answer an incoming call on a different calling app.
Multi-app control is only available with Webex (version 41.8 or later) and Cisco Jabber (version 14.1 or later) over Bluetooth or with the USB cable.
The following table shows the minimum headset firmware requirements for multi-app support.
