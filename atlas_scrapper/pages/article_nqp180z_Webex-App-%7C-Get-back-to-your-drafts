Webex App | Get back to your drafts
Sometimes you start typing a message only to find your attention is needed in another space, or conversation. Webex App keeps drafts of your messages so you can get back to them if you don't send them right away. You'll see an icon next to spaces with drafts left in them, so you can easily jump back whenever youâ€™re ready to hit send.

Go to your spaces list, click a space with next to the name, to view the draft message you want to complete.

  To see all your draft messages, click , go to Drafts, then choose the message you want to complete.
Also, your message drafts are retained even after a restart, so you can always get back to them.
