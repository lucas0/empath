Webex App | Prevent participants from starting their video during a meeting
As a meeting host or cohost, if you don't want anyone in the meeting to be on video, prevent participants from starting their video. When you choose this option, no one in the meeting, including the host and cohost, can turn on their video. If anyone has already started their video, their video stops.
This feature is available on our Video Mesh-ready meeting platform. Find out if your meetings use the Video Mesh-ready meeting platform.
