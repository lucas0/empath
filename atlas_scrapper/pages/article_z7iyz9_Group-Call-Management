Overview
Group call management is an advanced call queue capability that makes it easy and affordable to support high call volume and team call handling services, as a core part of Webex Calling. It adds key features that provide supervisor capabilities, enhances queue policies to determine call routing based on business hours, provides skill-based routing, provides call back capabilities for customers and reports and analytics for administrators. Group call management is an out-of-box feature set within Webex Calling.
Group Call Management refers to a collection of features designed to work together in support of managing high call volume sales and support teams, for calls directed to a call queue. The features include:
Call Queuing
Skills-based routing
Request customer callback (for callers in queue)
Enhanced queue policies for night service, holiday service, force forwarding, stranded calls
Additional IVR functions whisper and comfort bypass
Agent login / logout of call queues
Agent status management
Assign call queue staff to call queues
Assign supervisors to agents
Monitor/ coach/ barge/call takeover (Supervisor functions)
Call queue reporting and analytics dashboards
Group Call Management is recommended for call queues up to 50 agents. We recommend Webex Contact Center for customers that require sophisticated customer engagement capabilities, omni-channel routing, or large scale, high call volume deployments.
