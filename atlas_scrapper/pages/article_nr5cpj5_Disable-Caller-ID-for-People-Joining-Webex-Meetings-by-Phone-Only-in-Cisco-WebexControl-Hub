Disable Caller ID for People Joining Webex Meetings by Phone Only in Cisco Webex Control Hub
When users join Cisco Webex Meetings meetings, events, or sessions using only their phone, their phone number is not displayed. You can turn this feature on so a partial caller ID shows.
Site administrators can turn on partial caller IDs for users dialing into meetings by phone only. When this feature is enabled, phone numbers for call-in users have the last four digits covered up with asterisks and look like this: "Call-in User_1 (+1234567****)." This feature doesn't impact people joining from the Webex Web App.
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Services, and under Meeting, select Sites.
2
Choose the Webex site to change the settings for, and click Configure Site.
3
Under Common Settings, select Site Options.
4
Check the Display Caller ID for dial-in users when available check box, and then click Update.
