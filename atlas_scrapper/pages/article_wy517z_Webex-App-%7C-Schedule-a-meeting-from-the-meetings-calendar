Webex App | Schedule a meeting from the meetings calendar
Schedule a meeting from the Meetings calendar when you want to schedule a one-time meeting link or a personal room meeting. You can also make sure that your meetings are end-to-end encrypted.
You or anyone you assign as a cohost can start the meeting, invite people to it, start breakout sessions, record the meeting, and share the recording.
End-to-end encryption for Webex App meetings
Scheduled meetings support end-to-end encryption. For more information on how to encrypt all your meetings by default, see Webex App | Set end-to-end encryption for meetings.
