Allow Users to Host Meetings from a Video Device Without a PIN in Cisco Webex Site Administration
You can allow hosts and attendees to host scheduled and Personal Room meetings from Cisco Webex video devices within your own organization. Users will no longer be asked "Are you the host?" and anyone can start the host's meeting from the device.

Your Webex site and users must be linked to Control Hub to enable this feature.

Sign in to Webex Site Administration, and go to Configuration > Common Site Settings > Options.
2
Scroll to Schedule Meeting Options and check the Allow users to let anyone with a host account on this site or anyone joining from an authenticated Cisco video device in this organization host their scheduled or Personal Room meetings check box.
3
Click Update.
4
(End user settings) Ask the user to go to the Webex site and Allow Others to Start My Personal Room Meetings from a Video Device without a PIN.
5
(End user settings) Ask the user to go to select and use the saved template for future meetings. See Create and Save a Template for Joining Meetings without a PIN.
