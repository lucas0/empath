Webex Wireless Phone 840 and 860 Release 1.3(0)
The 1.3(0) release is available for the Webex Wireless Phone 840 and 860. In addition to the features from 1.2(0), the 1.3(0) release also includes the following features:
Multiple Lines
The multiple lines feature allows you to configure up to six lines with different phone numbers on a phone. Each line has a distinct phone number and color code. Users can make and receive calls from all lines. If you configure the phone to allow multiple calls at once, users can have up to four calls per line at once.
Cisco Extension Mobility
Through a log in process, the extension mobility feature allows different users to use the same phone at different times. When a user logs in to the phone, the phone uses their profile configuration including their line numbers, speed dials, and privacy settings. When the user logs out, their user-specific settings are removed, and the default configurations of the phone apply.
Shared Line
The shared line feature allows you to configure the same phone number on multiple phones. When someone calls a shared line, all the phones with that shared line ring, and any user with the shared line can answer the call.
Privacy
The privacy feature allows users with shared lines to view the status of shared calls and to barge into shared calls. You can enable or disable the privacy feature for each phone or for all phones in a cluster.
Auto Answer
The auto answer feature allows you to set a phone to automatically connect to incoming calls after a ring or two.
Line Text Label
The line text label feature allows users to set a text label for a phone line instead of using the directory number.
