Register for a meeting or webinar
Registration lets the host gather information about Webex Meetings and Webex Webinars attendees, restrict access, and secure meeting and event information.
Why should you register for a meeting or webinar?
Not all meetings and webinars require registration. If your meeting or webinar does, you can register from the email invitation.

  Make sure to use a computer or your mobile deviceâ€™s browser to register. You can't currently register from the Meetings mobile app.
Once the host approves your registration, you receive a registration confirmation email. You can now join the meeting or webinar once it starts. If the meeting or webinar is already in progress, and the host has chosen to approve all registration requests automatically, you join the meeting or webinar immediately.
If you're the host, schedule a meeting or webinar that requires attendees to register.
1
Open the email invitation and click Register.
2
In the webinar registration form, click Register. Complete the registration form and click Register again.
3
You can see your status on the registration page.
If your registration is approved, an approval message appears on the registration screen, and you'll also receive an email. Click OK, then open the email and click Join webinar when it's time to join.
If your registration is approved and the webinar has started, you see a Join webinar button.
If your registration is not immediately approved, it's sent to the webinar host and your status shows as pending. You'll receive an email to let you know when the host has approved or not approved your registration.
