Enable Borderless CTI through Webex Cloud-Connected UC
In this article
Overview
Computer telephony integration (CTI) enables you to use Webex App to leverage computer-processing functions while making, receiving, and managing telephone calls. CTI applications allow you to retrieve customer information from a database on the basis of information provided from the caller ID. CTI applications also enable you to use information that interactive voice response (IVR) system captures, so that the call is routed to the appropriate customer service representative or the information is provided to the individual who is receiving the call.
Currently, you can use Webex App to control Deskphone of the Desk IP phones or Remote Phones(Extend & Connect) using CTI when the Webex App is on premise.
When you work remotely from home will not be able to do Deskphone control of the Desk IP phones when the Webex App is connected over MRA without VPN as Cisco Expressway does not support it. You want to use Webex App to make and receive calls using a home or hotel phone (Extend & Connect), because their PC hardware or available network connection does not support VoIP will not work over MRA as Cisco Expressway does not support it.
Borderless CTI feature provides support to you over internet (MRA users). This feature enables you to control Desk-phone control and Extend and Connect. Borderless CTI provides:
Deskphone control: You want to connect Webex App to desk phone to handle calls (dial digits, make calls, end calls and so on )
Extend & Connect : You want to use Webex App to make and receive calls which use home or hotel phone, because your PC hardware or available network connection does not support VoIP. Refer Extend and Connect.
