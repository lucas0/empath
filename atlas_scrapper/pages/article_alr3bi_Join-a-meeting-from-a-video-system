Join a meeting from a video system
You can join a scheduled Webex standard meeting, Personal Room meeting, or meeting from a space from a standards-based video system.
Choose how you want to join the meeting:
Dial the video address from a standards-based video system or a Webex room or desk device.

  You can find the video address in the calendar invite. If it's a Webex App meeting that is associated with a space, you can also find the video address from the space. In the space, click Schedule and select the meeting. The video address appears under Meeting description.
Tap the Join button from a standards-based video system or a Webex room or desk device.
Automatically join the meeting. You can automatically join from your app after someone joins the meeting from a room device, and you have your app enabled to connect automatically with it. To join a meeting from a space automatically from Webex App on your computer or mobile device, you must be a member of the space that the meeting is associated with.
The Join button appears 5 minutes before the scheduled start time for Webex room and desk devices if the device is scheduled as a room resource and if you have Hybrid Calendar and Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft Office 365, or Google Calendar for G Suite.
If the meeting is associated with a space that you're not a member of, you'll wait in the lobby until another member of the space has joined.

  Your meeting is automatically end-to-end encrypted.
