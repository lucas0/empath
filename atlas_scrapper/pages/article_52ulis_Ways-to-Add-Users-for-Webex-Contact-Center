Ways to Add Users for Webex Contact Center
You can add users manually, in bulk using the comma-separated value (CSV) files or using the automatic license assignment. Manually you can add up to 25 users, and with CSV, you can add up to 1000 users to your organization for contact center access.
For more details on automatic license assignment, see Set up automatic license assignments in Control Hub.
Use the automatic license assignment to assign standard or premium license to a user. You can continue to mark a user as a supervisor manually.
Avoid adding a user to multiple groups as a user requires a single contact center license. If both standard and premium licenses are assigned by adding a user to multiple groups, the premium license applies.
While configuring automatic license assignment for contact center users, avoid applying the template to the existing users. If applied to existing users, all custom profiles may reset to default user profiles. We recommend that you use the automatic license assignment for new users.

After you complete these steps to update an existing user's license, you must synchronize users to the Management Portal on Control Hub. Navigate to Services > Contact Center > Settings > General and click Synchronize Users.
Ensure that you update the licenses in the Users module of the Management Portal.
When a user is deleted on Control Hub, the corresponding contact center user will be deleted automatically.
