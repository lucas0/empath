Webex App | Stop automatically connecting to a Webex device
Your Webex App automatically connects with Board, Desk, and Room Series devices when you're near them. If your app keeps connecting to a device you don't want to use, simply turn off automatic connections.
You can still manually connect to a Webex device.
Windows
Mac
iPhone, iPad, and Android
You can turn off automatic connections using one of two methods:
Open settings from your profile picture, click Devices > Advanced settings, and uncheck Automatically connect to devices to stop connecting to the nearest device in a room.
If you prefer, stop automatically connecting to a specific Webex device. If you recently connected to a Webex device, it's listed under Recent devices. Uncheck Automatically connect next to the device that you want to stop automatically connecting to.
In the app header, click the name of the Webex device that you're connected to. In the dialog box that opens, click the name of the device again, and then toggle off Automatically connect to this device.
