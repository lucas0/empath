Use virtual backgrounds in Webex Meetings and Webex Webinars
Limit distractions and maintain privacy in your current surroundings by using a virtual background. You can blur your background, change your background, or add your own background.
Blurring your background makes your surroundings appear out of focus so people can't see the details of what's going on behind you. You can also completely replace your surroundings with one of the preset backgrounds, one that your site administrator provides, or add one of your own.

  Having issues or don't see the Change Background option?
Make sure your Webex site administrator enabled virtual backgrounds for your site. If virtual backgrounds aren't enabled, the Change background option doesn't appear. The backgrounds that you can choose depend on what your site administrator allows for your site.
Check the list of requirements to make sure your Webex version and computer or device supports virtual backgrounds.
Virtual backgrounds aren't supported on the Meetings web app or on Linux.
Webex Training doesn't support virtual backgrounds.
Using virtual backgrounds increases the CPU usage of your computer or mobile device and may impact your battery life.
