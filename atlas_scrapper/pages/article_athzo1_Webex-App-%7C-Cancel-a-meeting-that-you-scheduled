Webex App | Cancel a meeting that you scheduled
Cancel a meeting that you scheduled when the meeting isnâ€™t necessary. The app sends a meeting cancellation email to the invitees and removes the meeting from everyone's calendar.

  If you didn't schedule the meeting but you want to remove it from your calendar, decline the meeting. Click the meeting in your calendar and click Decline. The app sends an email to the meeting host, notifying them that you declined the meeting.
To change the meeting details, such as the time, date, or who you invite, update the meeting instead of canceling it.
