Workspaces
A workspace contains one or more Webex devices that are in a common area like a lunch room, lobby, or conference room. You can set up shared Webex devices in these workspaces, add services, and then watch the collaboration happen. Whatever device you choose to add to that workspace, the device is assigned to the workspace, not a user.
