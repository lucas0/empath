Webex App | Set up your Personal Room
If you have a Webex account, you can use your Personal Room for your meetings. If it's not already set up for you, you can set it up yourself. If you have multiple Personal Rooms, you can choose which one to use.
Windows and Mac
Mobile
Web
Your Personal Room may already be set up in Webex App. To check, go to Meetings and see if your personal room link is included at the top of your screen. If it is, you're all set and don't need to do a thing.
If you see Set Up My Personal Room instead, follow these steps to set it up.
1
Go to Meetings and click Set Up My Personal Room.
2
Enter the Personal Room link in the format https://company.webex.com/meet/username or company.webex.com/meet/username and then enter your host PIN.

  If you belong to multiple Webex sites and, as a result, have multiple Personal Rooms, you can choose the room you prefer to associate with Webex App.
If you're not sure what your Personal Room link and host PIN are, you can go to your Webex site to see them. Your Webex site link is usually in the format company.webex.com. After you sign in, go to Preferences > My Personal Room to see them. If a Personal Room link and host PIN don't appear there, a Personal Room is not enabled for you on your site. Contact your site administrator.
