How to integrate Webex App with your archiving or DLP solution
You can assign at least one user as a compliance officer in Control Hub. You can use your users' credentials in your archiving or DLP software. Contact the support or sales team for your archiving or DLP software to complete the configuration.
If you don't see Webex integration with 3rd party archival vendor listed above (such as Proof point, Global Relay, OpenText, Bloomberg Vault and others) contact our archival partners 17a-4 or Theta Lake.
Contact cadi-archival@cisco.com for assistance, if you have an existing Cisco Advanced Services contract for your Global Relay integration with Webex and need support.
