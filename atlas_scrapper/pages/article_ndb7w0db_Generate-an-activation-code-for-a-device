Generate an activation code for a device
You must activate devices that you add to Webex, and we provide activation codes to help you do that. You need a unique activation code for each device, which you can generate at any time from Control Hub.
Generate an activation code for a device
Before you begin
Only specific roles have permission to generate activation codes. For more information, see Assign organization account roles in Control Hub.
If you're generating an activation code for an analog telephone adapter (ATA), you must configure all network settings before you activate the device.
After you activate the device, you can't access or change these network settings. Here are a few examples of available network settings: VLAN, IP address, and subnet mask.
1
Sign in to https://admin.webex.com, and go to Workspaces or Users.
2
Select the User or Workspace that you want to generate an activation code for.
3
Select Add Device.
You'll be presented with a QR code and a 16-digit activation code. The activation code expires after 7 days.
4
Enter the activation code or scan the QR code on the device. You can also email the activation code to the user assigned to the device, or another person in your organization, so that they can activate the device.
