Webex for Jira
Start, schedule, and join Personal Room meetings directly from a ticket in Jira Service Management and Jira Software. You can create a space and associate it with a specific ticket, to keep relevant conversation history and content between collaborators in one spot. Associate as many spaces you need and unlink those you don't to keep conversations organized. Want to associate an existing space? You can do that too.
Webex App needs to be installed by a Jira administrator, so they can link your Webex site.

Your Webex site administrator can restrict integrations on the account that you use to sign into Jira. If you receive an access error, contact your administrator to confirm your account information. Host accounts need to have Personal Rooms enabled to start, schedule, and join meetings from Jira.
