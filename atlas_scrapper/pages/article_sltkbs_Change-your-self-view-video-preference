Change your self-view video preference
During a Webex meeting, webinar, or event, your self-view video shows with the thumbnail videos of the other participants. If you prefer, you can show your self-view video in a floating window or hide it.
Showing your self-view video with the other thumbnail videos lets you see the same view of yourself that others see.
