Create Custom Session Types for Your Cisco Webex Site in Site Administration
Site administrators can create custom session types that enable or disable features for Webex Meetings Suite users.
Before you begin
You must have the custom session types options enabled to see Session Types options in the navigation bar. For more information, or if you do not see Session Types in the navigation bar, contact your Webex representative.
After you create a new session type, you cannot delete it. However, you can modify it or turn off it.
1
Sign in to Webex Site Administration and go to Configuration > Common Site Settings > Session Types.
2
In the Session Code column, locate the primary session type for which you want to create a custom session type.
3
Click the Add session type for <session type> link.
4
Enter a name for the custom session type.
5
Select the features that you want to include in the session type.
6
Click Add.

  To enable a host to host sessions with the custom session type that you created, enable that session type for the host user account.
