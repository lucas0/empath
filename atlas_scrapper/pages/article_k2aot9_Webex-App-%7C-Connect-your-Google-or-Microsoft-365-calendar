Webex App | Connect your Google or Microsoft 365 calendar
You can manage your meetings from your Google or Microsoft 365 calendar directly in the Webex App. Connect to the calendar of your choice in the app settings to see your meetings and events in the Meetings tab. However, if your administrator has already set up your calendar, you won't be able to change it.

Your calendar might not be populated with all your meetings right away.

  When your calendar permission is due to expire, you receive a notification in the app 10 days in advance to remind you to reauthorize your connection.
If you want to remove a calendar, go to Connect a calendar, select the calendar and click Disconnect.
