Webex App | Filter your @ Mentions
Webex App lets you quickly access your most relevant @ Mentions. You'll be able to filter between your Mentions to Me, that need your immediate attention, or Mentions to All, sent to everyone, so that you can easily distinguish between your most important messages.
Desktop
iPhone and iPad
Android
Web
Click to view your filters, then select Mentions to Me to see messages sent directly to you, or select Mentions to All to view messages sent to everyone in a space.

  You'll see some older @ Mentions which mention you directly, in your Mentions to All filter.
