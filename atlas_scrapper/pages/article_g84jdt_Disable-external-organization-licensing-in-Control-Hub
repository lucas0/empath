Disable external organization licensing in Control Hub
By default, other organizations can assign Webex Meetings licenses to users within your organization. If you want to make sure users in your organization are not assigned accounts on meetings sites from other organizations, you can disable this setting.

  This setting is off by default for Webex for Government organizations.
When you disable this setting, other organizations can't assign their Webex Meetings licenses to users in your organization. This applies to host and attendee accounts.

  This setting doesn't prevent licensing of users for Webex Meeting sites managed from Site Admin. Those users retain their licenses when those external sites are converted to Control Hub managed sites. This setting only blocks users from getting licenses from Control Hub managed sites.
This setting doesn't affect users who already have Webex Meetings site licenses from other organizations (including accounts on Meeting sites managed from Control Hub). Those users will continue to have services on those external sites.
1
Sign in to Control Hub and go to Meeting > Settings.
2
Toggle the Allow licenses from external organizations switch to off in the External organization licensing section.
