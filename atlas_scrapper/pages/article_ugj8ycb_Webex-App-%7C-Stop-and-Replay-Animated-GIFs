Webex App | Stop and Replay Animated GIFs
When someone shares a GIF in a space in Webex App, the GIFs play automatically but stop looping after a few seconds. But, you can play them again whenever you'd like.
1
While the GIF plays for the first time, you can click , to stop it immediately.
2
After the GIF finishes looping the first time, just hover over it and click to play it again.

  When you go to a space, any unseen GIFs play automatically. But, if you've left a space while a GIF was playing, it won't restart automatically when you go back to the space.
