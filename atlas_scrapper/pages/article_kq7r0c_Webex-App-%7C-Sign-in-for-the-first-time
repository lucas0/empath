Webex App is now making it easier to authenticate yourself by using a confirmation PIN when creating your account. The first time you sign in to Webex App you receive a six-digit confirmation PIN to verify your email address. Then, you can create your password and sign in. This increases the safety and security of the sign-in process.

  If you didn't receive the confirmation code, check your email account details are correct and click Send it again .
You won't receive a PIN if your organization uses Single Sign-On (SSO) to sign in to Webex App.
