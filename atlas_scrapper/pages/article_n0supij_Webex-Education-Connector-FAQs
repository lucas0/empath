Webex Education Connector FAQs
You can read some of the most frequently asked questions about using the Cisco Webex Education Connector with your LMS. Check back occasionally for updates.
Common Issue Troubleshooting Steps
Try the following steps if you're encountering a problem in Webex Education Connector.
If you recently installed and are having problems, try to uninstall and reinstall. Follow all the installation instructions for your LMS.
Authorize Cisco Webex Education Connector with your LMS by going to the Setup tab and clicking Authorize. For Canvas and D2L customers: also click Sync for Time Zone.
If you're having problems with your Virtual Meetings, logout of Cisco Webex Education Connector and then login.
How do I ensure that my recorded meetings show up in the Webex Education Connector?
You must always be signed in to Webex Meetings in the Virtual Meetings section of Webex Education Connector for meeting recordings to sync to Webex Education Connector.
Webex Meetings sessions expire after several days of inactivity. We recommend that you sign out and sign back in to Webex from Webex Education Connector every few weeks to keep your session active. If your token expires, you're prompted to sign in to Webex Meetings the next time you access the Webex Education Connector.
Why am I unable to authorize the application in Moodle?
Moodle sites must have a valid SSL certificate to authorize successfully. If the web browser indicates Not Secure, the Moodle site does not have a valid SSL certificate.
To get a valid SSL certificate for your Moodle site:
Login to Moodle as an administrator.
Go to Site Administration > Security > HTTP security.
Check the Use HTTPs for logins box and click Save.
I'm getting the error, "The URL's Doman has been blocked. Contact your site administrator for more details." when launching Virtual Meetings for the first time.
Configure your Cisco Webex Site to allow additional URL domain names:
For sites managed in Webex Site Administration, sign in to Webex Site Administration and go to Configuration > Common Site Settings > Options.
For sites managed in Control Hub, go to the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, then go to Services, and under Meeting, select Sites. Choose the Webex site to change the settings for and select Settings, and under Common Settings, select Security.
Under Security, scroll down to the Other section.
Enter http://lti.educonnector.io/ in the Allow the following URL domain names field.
Click Update.
How is office hours availability determined?
Once an instructor sets Office Hours in any course, the same availability is displayed in all other courses for the instructor whether they have set office hours in other courses or not. This prevents the instructor from booking the same time for two different courses.
I'm getting an error when trying to schedule office hours or a virtual meeting.
Authorize Cisco Webex Education Connector with your LMS by going to the Setup tab and clicking Authorize. For Canvas and D2L customers: also click Sync for Time Zone.
If you're having problems with your Virtual Meetings, log out of Webex within the Webex Education Connector and then log back in.
To log out, click Log out of Webex in the upper-right corner of the Webex Education Connector.
How does grading work?
When you enable grading in Cisco Webex Education Connector through the Setup tab, an assignment appears in the gradebook called "Webex Meetings Attendance Assignment."
The formula for calculating the grade is:
(Present score)*(total number of times student was present)+(absent score)*(total number of times student was absent)/(total number of meetings*present score)
What makes someone's attendance show up as present for a meeting?
When someone joins a meeting using the Webex Education Connector through the LMS, their attendance is recorded. If someone joins Webex through a link outside of the LMS, their attendance is not recorded.
How can I schedule office hours with multiple students?
The purpose of office hours meetings is for students to schedule 1-on-1 meetings with the instructor. If multiple students are needed, schedule a virtual meeting and name it "Office Hours," instead of using the office hours feature.
How can I enable meeting recording sync in the Webex Education Connector?
Recordings of meetings started from within the Webex Education Connector sync automatically. To record meetings, click the Start tab and then record.
Meetings started from outside the Webex Education Connector or that aren't recorded in the cloud can't be synced.
If your meetings are synced to your LMS Calendar, you can record meetings that you start from there.
You must be signed in to Webex Meetings in the Virtual Meetings section for meeting recordings to sync within Webex Education Connector.
Webex Meetings sessions expire after several days after inactivity. We recommend that you sign out and sign back in to Webex from Webex Education Connector every few weeks to keep your session active. If your token expires, you're prompted to sign in to Webex Meetings the next time you access the Webex Education Connector.
