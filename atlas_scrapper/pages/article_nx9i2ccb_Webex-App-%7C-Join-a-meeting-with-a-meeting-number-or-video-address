Webex App | Join a meeting with a meeting number or video address
You can join a meeting by entering the meeting number or the video address in Webex App. If your administrator has defined a prefix or suffix so that you can dial the meeting number instead of the video address, you can use that shortcut.

Go to Meetings and click Join a meeting above your meeting calendar.

  Your meeting is automatically end-to-end encryped.
