Configure Disclaimers for Your Webex Site Using Webex Control Hub
If you want to provide information that must be acknowledged by your users, you can set up disclaimers for Webex meetings and recordings. You can manage each disclaimer type independently. When Webex displays a disclaimer, the user must acknowledge the disclaimer to continue.
Set Up Disclaimers
You can set up disclaimers to appear each time that:
A host starts a meeting, event, or training session.
Participants join a meeting, event, or training session.
Someone downloads and plays a Webex recording.
The following file types are supported: HTML, HML, and TXT. Create a disclaimer file for each type of disclaimer, and for each language that the site supports.
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Services, and under Meeting, select Sites.
2
Choose the Webex site to change the settings for, and click Configure Site.
