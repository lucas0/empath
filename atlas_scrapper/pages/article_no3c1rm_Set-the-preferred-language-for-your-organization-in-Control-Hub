Set the preferred language for your organization in Control Hub
In this article
You can change the language settings in Control Hub, and the settings are applied to new users when they're onboarded. The language setting affects their phone screens, voicemail prompts, and the announcements played when they dial incorrect numbers in a dial plan.
Set the preferred language for your organization

The new language is only applied to users onboarded after this change is made.
Before you begin
If you've synchronized users from your Active Directory, then the preferred language from the Active Directory overrides the language you configure at the organizational level. See supported languages for more information.

Under Regional Settings, select the Preferred Language, and save your changes.
You'll see these changes across your organization and your users' phones may restart.
Change the preferred language for specific users
