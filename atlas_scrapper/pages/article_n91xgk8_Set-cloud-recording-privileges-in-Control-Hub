Set cloud recording privileges in Control Hub
Choose who can record meetings to the cloud on your Webex site. Limit the option to hosts only, hosts and cohosts, or hosts, cohosts, and participants. You can also choose to let cohosts receive all the recording details or limit them to view-only privileges.
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Services > Meeting.
2
Click Settings.
3
Scroll to Cloud recordings and choose who in the meeting can record.

To allow cohosts to automatically receive the recording details with view-only privileges, toggle on Allow cohosts view-only privliges.

  Cohosts can still view and share the recording, including the transcript with others when given view-only privileges.
Only cohosts in the same organization as the host can automatically receive the meeting details.
