Manage Webex Assistant content after a Webex Meeting or Webex Webinars
If you turn on Webex Assistant for Webex Meetings during a meeting or webinar, highlights, transcript, and recording will be available on your Webex site. If you're the host of the meeting or webinar, you can share, edit, and delete post-meeting and webinar content produced by Webex Assistant for Meetings. Also, when referring back to a specific moment in a meeting or webinar, you can use the search bar at the top of your Webex page to search your meetings, webinars, recordings, and transcripts to find an important moment in a meeting or webinar.
Webex Assistant is available in meetings and webinars. For 41.7 or later sites, it is also available in the Webex App.

  Webex Assistant is not supported for webinars in webcast view, Webex for Government, or for meetings started or joined from a space in the Webex App.
Webex Assistant requires Cisco Webex video platform version 2.0 with joining meetings from video systems enabled. To find out which version youâ€™re using, see Find your Webex Meetings version number.
