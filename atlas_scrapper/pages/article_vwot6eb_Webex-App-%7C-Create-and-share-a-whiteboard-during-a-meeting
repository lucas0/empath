Webex App | Create and share a whiteboard during a meeting
Use a whiteboard to visually convey the message youâ€™re trying to get across. You can share and edit any whiteboard during a meeting. Sharing live lets everyone in the meeting see and work on updates to the whiteboard together in real time.
Multiple people can edit and view shared whiteboards at the same time. These include people joining from Webex App for Windows, Mac or web.
Other people in the meeting can only view whiteboards in the meeting, including:
Skype for Business, and other 3rd party apps
Webex App for iPhone, iPad or Android
Standards based video endpoints (SIP, H.323)
