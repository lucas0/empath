Allow Users to Host Meetings from a Video Device Without a PIN in Control Hub
You can allow hosts and attendees to host scheduled and Personal Room meetings from Cisco Webex video devices. Users will no longer be asked "Are you the host?" and anyone can start the host's meeting from the device.
Enabling this setting allows hosts and attendees to host Webex meetings without a PIN from video devices. If you want to enable this setting for on-premises video devices, you have to verify your domains and configure your Expressways to use mutual TLS (mTLS) for the sip.webex.com domain.
