Enhanced 988 National Suicide Prevention Lifeline for Webex Calling
In this article
Overview
As per the current guideline, a user trying to reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Veterans Crisis Line must dial the standard 10-digit number 1-800-273-8255.
On July 16, 2020, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted rules to establish 988 as the new nationwide easy-to-remember 3-digit phone number for Americans in crisis to connect with suicide prevention and mental health crisis counselors.
Although 988 is not a nationwide calling code right now, Webex Calling can transform dialing 988 to 1-800-273-8255 by helping you connect to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline quickly.
Beginning July 16, 2022, dialing 988 will route calls to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Veterans Crisis Line. In making 3-digit access to a national suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline a reality. The FCC designated 988 as the 3-digit number to reach the Lifeline, and require all telecommunications carriers, interconnected VoIP providers, and one-way VoIP providers (together, covered providers) to make any network change necessary to ensure that users can dial 988 to reach the Lifeline by July 16, 2022. These rules ease access to suicide prevention and crisis intervention services, decreasing the stigma surrounding suicide and mental health crises, and ultimately saving lives.
