Manually adjust camera settings on Board and Room Series
The camera settings let you manually control the zoom, pan, and tilt of the camera. On Board and Room Series you can also define, edit, and save camera position presets from a touch controller.
Using manual camera control on a touch controller, you can create custom views with predefined zoom and camera direction. For example, maybe you need a zoomed out preset for meetings with multiple participants, and a zoomed in preset for smaller meetings. The presets will be available in the camera control screen and you can easily switch between them for different types of meetings.
