Webex App | Supported calling options
In Webex App, you get assigned a calling option that works best in your organization or for your individual needs. So, when you make a call from the app, your calling experience depends on your account settings.
You can make a call from many different places in Webex App. Just look for the Audio or Video call icons whenever you're sending a direct message, looking at a contact card, or entering a name, email address, or video address into the Search bar.

  If you don't see the option to make a video call, it could be because your administrator only wants you making audio calls.
Calls on Webex App
Anyone with a Webex App account (on desktop, mobile, or web) can call anyone else with a Webex App account. It doesn't matter whether they're part of the same organization or what type of calling service they're set up with.
You don't need to use their phone number; you just need to be connected to them in the app to call or answer calls from someone with a Webex App account. In-call options include: adding guests to the call, sharing your whiteboard, and sharing your screen.
After reviewing the final marketing plan shared in a direct message with a vendor, for example, you can call the vendor immediately to let them know about the last-minute logo change.
You can also manually enter a video address (SIP address) in the search bar if you want to call a non-Webex App user with an address or dial into a meeting bridge (such as username@example.webex.com.)
Call phone numbers within your organization
Your administrator might set up your account so that you can call someone in your organization (work or mobile number) and answer their calls too. Click your manager’s phone number and have a face-to-face call right over Webex App to let them know about the success of your marketing plan.
With this setup, you get access to more calling features (on desktop and mobile), depending on which calling option your organization chooses. To figure out which calling service you've been set up with, see Find out what calling service you have.
Call anyone with a phone number
If your organization is using Unified CM or Webex Calling, you can also call anyone with a phone number or answer calls from anyone calling your work number. When you make these types of calls, it's just like making a regular phone call from any other phone. When it's time to make reservations for your team's celebration lunch, you can call the restaurant right from Webex App too. Just go to Calls and enter the phone number.

  If you're not set up with Unified CM, Webex Calling, or calling hosted by a service provider, you won't see a dial pad.

Your call settings
You can access your call settings right from Webex App. When you go to Additional Call Settings, you have the following options, depending on your setup:
Advanced Call Settings—This link takes you to some more call settings, such as voicemail, block caller ID, more call forwarding options.
Access User Portal—You see this option if you're set up with Webex Calling or if your service provider has enabled this option for you. Here, you have access to a few more settings that aren't available from the Advanced Call Settings link. For example, voicemail PIN reset, scheduling for certain features (call forwarding, call rejection, and so on), and Executive Assistant settings.
