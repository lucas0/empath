Lock the Device Settings for a User or Workspace
When you're a full administrator, you can lock device settings, such as network setup. When you lock the device settings for a user or workspace, specific settings for all assigned Cisco Webex room and desk devices can no longer be changed by anyone other than an administrator.
Here are the settings that you can lock on room and desk devices. Keep in mind it's all or nothing. If you turn on the Lock Settings toggle, all of the following settings are locked. You can't pick and choose. Users canâ€™t update the settings on their device if Lock Settings on Touch Devices is enabled.
Language
Time zone
Resolution
Overscan
Camera default preset
Network setup
Touch panel network connection
Unpair touch panel
