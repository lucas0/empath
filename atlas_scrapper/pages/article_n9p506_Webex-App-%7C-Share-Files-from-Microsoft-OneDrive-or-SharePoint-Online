Your administrator can change which of these options are available in OneDrive or SharePoint Online.
Anyone—Anyone can view the file, including people from outside your organization. To allow people to edit the file, click Allow editing.
People in your organization—Only people in your organization can view the file. To allow them to edit the files, click Allow editing.
People currently in this space—Access to the file is shared with everyone in the space. To allow them to edit the files, click Allow editing.

  People added to the space after the file is shared, won't automatically be given permission. Hover over the file in the space and click Update file share, to reshare the file. When the permission is updated everyone in the space will have access to the file.
People with existing access—Webex App uses the permissions already set up for viewing and editing this file in OneDrive or SharePoint Online.
When people don't have access to the file, they see the file name but they can't edit or view the file or see a thumbnail preview.
