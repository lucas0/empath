Configure Notifications for Hybrid Services
After you deploy Hybrid Services, you, along with other people in your organization or outside your organization, may want to receive notifications about the service status, alarms, software upgrades, and so on. You can subscribe people to any combination of email and Webex app bot notifications.

  If users no longer want to receive email notifications about Hybrid Calendar status, you can also disable these notifications for users.
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Services > Hybrid, and then click Edit settings from a hybrid service card.
2
Under the General section, subscribe people to any of these notifications:
Scroll to Email Notifications, and then enter any email accounts for people who want to receive email notifications about Hybrid Services.
If you chose the settings for Hybrid Calendar, scroll to User Email Notifications, and then toggle on or off the email notification to set whether users receive email notifications about new Hybrid Calendar features as they're released.
Scroll to Notifications in the Webex App, and then then enter any email accounts for people who want to receive bot notifications in Webex Teams about Hybrid Services.
