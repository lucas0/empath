Switch your audio during Webex Meetings, Webex Webinars, or Webex Events (classic)
You can change your audio connection during a meeting, webinar, or event, regardless of how you originally joined. If you have to step away from a meeting on your computer, you can switch the audio to call your mobile phone.

Click , then click Switch audio. Select the option that you want to use.
Depending on your meeting, webinar, or event type, you may not see every option.
Use computer audio—Click Switch to connect audio using your computer. This option gives you the highest audio quality for the most robust meeting experience.
Call me at—Enter a phone number and click Switch to have the meeting, webinar, or event call you. Connecting on your phone gives you the freedom to move around while still being able to participate in discussions.
Call in—Click View to see a phone number and access code to connect audio on your phone. Make a note of the access code or meeting number and the attendee ID. You'll need to enter these numbers to join the meeting.
Select one of the available numbers to join the meeting and when prompted, enter the access code or meeting number and the attendee ID. If you don't have your attendee ID, press # to wait in the lobby until someone in the meeting lets you in.

  Your attendee ID connects your name in the meeting to your audio. If you don’t enter your attendee ID, your audio connection appears as a call-in user in the Participants list, separate from your name, and you can’t control audio from the application.
