Webex App | Adjust the font size
Webex App for iPhone and iPad uses a default font size of 17pt. to display your messages, which we hope feels just about the right size for most of you. If not, you can choose your preferred font size using Dynamic Type on your device, and Webex App adjusts to that setting.
So, if you want to make your text a little smaller so you can see more information at once, or a little bit larger to make sure you donâ€™t miss any details, change these settings on your iPhone or iPad.
On your device, go to Settings > Display & Brightness > Text Size and drag the slider to select the font size you prefer.

  Keep in mind that you're changing the Settings on your device, not in Webex App.
