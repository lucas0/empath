Webex App | Reduce File Size when Sharing
When you're using Webex App on the go, you're often connecting using cellular data rather than Wi-Fi. So, when you're sharing images or video that are larger than 5 MB, you might have reduced bandwidth or limited data roaming that prevents you from successfully sending the message. You can automatically reduce the video or image size when you send it, to reduce how much data you need to get it posted.

Android
You can compress images or video you're sharing, that are larger than 5 MB.
Before you begin
Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is set to use the most compatible file formats. On your device, go to Settings > Camera > Formats, and then tap Most Compatible. Refer to Apple's support site if you need more information about High Efficiency Image File (HEIF) formats.

Ask—You'll be asked if you want to compress images and videos when you're sending them.
Always—Images and videos you send are always compressed.

  You can change the settings at any time.
