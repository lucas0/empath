Collect Webex App logs from users in Control Hub
With the click of a button, you can retrieve Webex App client logs from users to help troubleshoot and resolve issues that theyâ€™ve experienced while using Webex.
When you collect a user's Webex App logs, any meeting that they joined within the last 30 days will show up in Control Hub. Users can also send logs to Control Hub themselves in the Webex App.
To collect a user's Webex App logs, the user must have the Webex App open and have an active internet connection. If the user's offline, then the logs won't be collected.
1
Sign in to Control Hub and go to Troubleshooting > Logs.
2
Search for a user with their email address.
3
Click Collect logs.
4
Select Collect.
