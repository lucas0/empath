Synchronize user and organizational contacts
In this article
Organizational contacts are identities imported or synchronized into Webex. You can search all users and organization contacts in an organization through Webex App and all Webex devices.
Understand organizational contacts
Use Control Hub to migrate or synchronize your organizational contacts to Webex. For on-premises deployments, organizational contacts are configured in the LDAP server as contact objects or in the Cisco Unified Communications Manager as end-users. You can configure rules in Control Hub to classify users in the Unified CM database into end users and contacts.
This tool does the following:
Synchronizes users and contacts from Unified CM or LDAP server to Webex.
Automatically detects updates in Unified CM based users and contacts and updates the changes into Webex.
You can set a schedule for the periodic sync to synchronize users and contacts from LDAP server into Webex.
Periodic audit could be configured to make sure Unified CM users and contact data doesn't get out of sync with Webex.

You can select only one source of users from either the Unified CM or LDAP server. If you configure directory connector, then you cannot synchronize users through the tool.

If you do not have Cisco Cloud connectivity, then use the CSV file through Control Hub to import your org contacts.
The prerequisites, Configure LDAP server search and set your preferences are mandatory sections which will guide you through the initial set up to import and synchronize your organizational contacts into Webex.
