Broadcast a message to breakout sessions
As a meeting host, you can share information with participants in one or all breakout sessions by broadcasting a written message to them.
If you want to send a message to cohosts and presenters in all breakout sessions, you can broadcast a written message that only they see.
This feature is supported on Webex Meetings and Webex Webinars. On Webex App, this feature is available on our Video Mesh-ready meeting platform.

  If the broadcast message option is not available, contact your Webex site administrator
