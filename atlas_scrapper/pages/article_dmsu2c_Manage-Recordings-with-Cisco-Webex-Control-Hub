Manage Recordings with Cisco Webex Control Hub
Site administrators can manage recordings for their site to help optimize available storage. For example, you can search for and delete recordings according to specific criteria. When the owner of a recording leaves your organization, you can also reassign them to a new user.

Use the search options to specify the criteria for your search.
