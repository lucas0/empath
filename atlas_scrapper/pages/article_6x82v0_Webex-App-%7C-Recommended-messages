Webex App | Recommended messages
Focus on the messages that matter most.
Recommended messages help you filter out the noise and focus on your most important messages. Your recommendations will improve and become more personalized as you continue to use Webex App.
Where are Recommended messages available?
Recommended messages are currently available across Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iPhone, and iPad, and when enabled are pinned to the top your spaces list.
How Does It Work?
Recommended messages prioritize messages by understanding the messages that matter most to you. For example, your manager's direct message is more important than a message from an unfamiliar person in a large space where you rarely respond.
One of the most critical criteria is your relationship with the sender. Your familiarity with someone, the organizational structure, and your responsiveness in spaces, help to determine how important and relevant a message may be. The size of the space a message was sent in is also considered.
Privacy
Recommendations are based only on metadata from messages. The end-to-end encryption of message content remains intact.
