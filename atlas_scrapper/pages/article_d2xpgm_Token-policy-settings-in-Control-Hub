Token policy settings in Control Hub
Overview
Requirements
Configure

  This feature is only available for customer full administrators who have purchased Webex Pro Pack.
Administrators can create a custom token policy for your Webex App for web, mobile or desktop users. A custom token policy gives you control over the following:
Turn on or off auto-extend refresh token
Specify the time-to-live (TTL) of the JSON web token (JWT)
Specify the TTL of the refresh token
With these features, you can control how often users are required to login on mobile, desktop, or web clients. As a compliance requirement, you may want your users to reauthenticate to make sure they are using the latest security policy in your organization.
