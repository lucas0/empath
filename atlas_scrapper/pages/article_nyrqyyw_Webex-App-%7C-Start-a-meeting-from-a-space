Webex App | Start a meeting from a space
Sometimes when you're working with people in a space, you may decide to have a meeting right away. The number of people who can join the meeting varies for each space, depending on Webex App licenses of people in that space.
Weâ€™ve enhanced the meeting experience in a space. Some of you may still have the classic experience.
For enhanced meetings associated with a space:
Only people internal to the organization can use the Meet button.
If a space has more than 3 people but less than 200, you can start an instant meeting directly from that space.
For classic meetings associated with a space: If a space has more than 3 people but less than 75, you can start an instant meeting directly from that space.

From your space, choose Meet .

  If you search for a space, you can click Meet beside the space name to start a meeting in that space.
The meeting starts instantly, and everyone in the space sees a Join button in their meeting list and in their spaces list in the app. If people have Smart Notifications configured, they'll also get a meeting notification on their computer or mobile device.

  Meeting notifications aren't shown for meetings that are started in spaces that have more than 25 participants.
