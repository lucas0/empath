Remove previews from shared website links in Webex App
You can use Pro Pack to prevent Webex App website previews from being displayed when users share links. You can remove previews for everyone in your organization, or for specific groups of users.
When Webex displays link previews, it shares the link with Google Safe Browsing for verification. Webex also reads metadata of the website to display in the preview. For both of these operations, the computer's IP address might be shared with the third-party website. If you don't want the app to do this on users' behalf, you can turn off previews for shared links.
This feature is enabled by default. Android, iPhone or iPad users can choose if they see the previews in their app.
We only show previews for links when the website links:
Include either https:// or http://
Are shared between people in your organization
Are shared in spaces with 250 people or less
Are checked by Google Safe Browsing
Have a site title and the description is longer than 10 words
Remove website previews for your entire organization
Remove website previews for groups in your organization
