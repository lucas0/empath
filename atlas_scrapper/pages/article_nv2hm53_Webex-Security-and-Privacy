Webex Security and Privacy
With Webex, weâ€™ve built a strong security solution that keeps your content safe from everyone. The Cloud Collaboration Security Paper Series explains our secure architecture.
Webex takes proactive measures to provide the highest level of security, based on a secure by design product development methodology and use of various security frameworks, so you can focus on the things that really matter.
We are committed to maintaining leadership in cloud security. Online collaboration must provide multiple levels of security for tasks that range from scheduling meetings to authenticating participants to sharing documents.
