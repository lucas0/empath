Webex App | Get details about meeting participants
When you're in a meeting in Webex App, you can quickly see who's joined the meeting regardless of whether they've joined from Webex App, from the Webex Meetings app, or from a video device. You can even see what they're up to during the meeting, such as who's muted and who's sharing their screen.

While in a meeting, go to Participants to find out who has joined the meeting or not and whether they're actively participating.

  Take a screen shot of the people list during the meeting if you want a reminder of who attended the meeting after it ends.
In the Meeting—Lists people who have joined the meeting, regardless of whether they've joined from Webex App, from the Meetings app, or from a video device. Paired room devices show the names of everyone paired to that device. You can also see who's hosting, muted, sharing, actively speaking, joined from outside of your organization, joined by phone only, or if someone has joined but hasn't yet connected their audio.

  To find the contact information of someone in the meeting, hover over their profile picture.
Waiting in the lobby—Sometimes people who join might have to wait in a virtual lobby before entering. You can choose who you want to let in and who you want to keep out
Not in the meeting—For a scheduled meeting or a Personal Room meeting, this section includes people who received a calendar invite for the meeting but haven't joined yet. For Webex App meeting that is associated with a space, this section includes people who are part of the space but haven't joined yet. This section also includes any people who joined the meeting but then left.
