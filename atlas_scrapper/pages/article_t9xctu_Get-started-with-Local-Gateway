Get started with Local Gateway
In this article
As an administrator, use this article to get your bearings with all the information and references to the related articles that you need to set up, maintain, and troubleshoot the Local Gateway.
Overview
Using a Local Gateway in Webex Calling, connect your on-premises deployment to the Webex Calling cloud. Continue to use your existing PSTN connection with Webex Calling, and also integrate an existing on-premises calling deployment with Webex Calling. In other words, you can migrate to the cloud at your own pace and integrate your existing deployment seamlessly with Webex Calling.
Ensure the following before configuring a Local Gateway for Webex Calling:
Fundamentals of VoIP, such as SIP and media protocols, and be able to perform basic troubleshooting.
Working understanding of the devices (session border controller) that are configured as a Local Gateway.
Required license to operate the session border controller.
Fundamentals of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) or equivalent PBX deployed in your premises and configured to work with Webex Calling. (In the case of an integration with an on-premises environment.)
