Delete whiteboards and end your session on Board and Desk Series
You can end your session at any time from your Board or Desk Series device, clearing up all whiteboards and browsing data for the next user.

This article only applies to shared devices.
By default your whiteboards and web data are deleted automatically every day at midnight. Ask your system administrator if the automatic cleanup is disabled or set to occur at a different time.
Board, Desk Series

When youâ€™re ready to end your session, swipe from the right side of the screen. Then tap End session.


Decide if you want to clear all whiteboards, all website data, or everything. Note that deleting website data appears only on devices that use the web engine.
