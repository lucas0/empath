Borderless CTI
Borderless CTI feature provides requirements for CTI functionality over MRA for users. Borderless CTI provides:
Deskphone control : You want to connect WxApp to desk phone to handle calls (dial digits , make calls , end calls etc )
Extend & Connect : You want to use WxApp to make and receive calls using a home or hotel phone, because your PC hardware or available network connection does not support VoIP. Extend and Connect

Once a cluster is provisioned, CUCM will start syncing with the CCUC cloud to get the CTI request for users configured for the cluster. This feature is supported on release 14.2 SU2 onwards for CUCM and the minimum Webex App version supported is v42.6.
