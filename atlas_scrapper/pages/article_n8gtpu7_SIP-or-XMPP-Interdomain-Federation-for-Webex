SIP or XMPP Interdomain Federation for Webex
You can allow communication between Webex App users and SIP or XMPP users in federated domains, via your on-premises IM & Presence service, if you have the Hybrid Message service enabled for the Webex users.
This integration enables your Webex App users to chat with users in federated XMPP or SIP domains. The integration uses your on-premises Cisco IM and Presence service, coupled with Webex Hybrid Message Service, so your Webex App users must be enabled for Hybrid Message.
