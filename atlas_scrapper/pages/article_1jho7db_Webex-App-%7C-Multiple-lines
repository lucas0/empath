Webex App | Multiple lines
If your administrator has set up your profile with multiple lines with different phone numbers for calling, they appear in the desktop version of your app. You can switch lines if you need to make outgoing calls from different lines, such as a front desk line, support team line, or an individual line with a different caller ID.
