Webex App | Join a Personal Room meeting
If you're asked to join a Personal Room meeting but you don't remember the link, you can still join it easily from that person's contact card.

When you subscribe to Webex from your Service Provider, you’ll need to contact your provider’s customer support team for assistance.

Go to Messaging , hover over the person's profile picture to see the contact card, and then select Join Personal Meeting Room.
The Join Personal Meeting Room option doesn't appear on someone's contact card if their Webex site is not managed in Control Hub or linked to Webex App.
Rather than scroll through your Messaging list, you can also see someone's contact card by searching for that person's name. In the search results, hover over the person's profile picture to see the contact card.

  To join a Personal Room meeting that you join often, go to Meetings and click Join a meeting. A list of recent Personal Room meetings that you joined appears under Recent Personal Rooms. Click the link to join the meeting.
