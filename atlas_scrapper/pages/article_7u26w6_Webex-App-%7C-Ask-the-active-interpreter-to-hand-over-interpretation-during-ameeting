Webex App | Ask the active interpreter to hand over interpretation during a meeting
Active interpreters need to focus on the task at hand. So, if you’re one of multiple interpreters that’s assigned to the same language and it's your turn next, you can ask the active interpreter to hand off to you at the end of their turn. The active interpreter can accept or decline your request.
When you finish your turn and it's time for the next interpreter to begin, you can hand off interpreting to the next interpreter.
This feature is available on our Video Mesh-ready meeting platform. Find out if your meetings use the Video Mesh-ready meeting platform.
