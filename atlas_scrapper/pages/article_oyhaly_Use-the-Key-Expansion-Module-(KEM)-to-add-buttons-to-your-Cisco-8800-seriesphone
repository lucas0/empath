Key Expansion Module power information
If you use a key expansion module with your IP phone, then Power over Ethernet (PoE) is enough to power your expansion modules. But, your phone must have an IP address in order to charge the expansion module.
A power cube is needed for smartphone or tablet charging when your key expansion module is attached.
A key expansion module uses 48V DC, 5W per module. If you are charging a smartphone or a tablet, note the following:
Side USB: Up to 500mA/2.5W charging
Back USB: Fast charging, Supports up to 2.1A/10.5W charging
