Webex App | About the Video Mesh-ready meeting platform
Over the next few months, Webex meetings will start to run on our Video Mesh-ready meeting platform. This platform allows for improved and simplified experiences for hybrid work across the entire Webex Suite, with common architecture, administration, and integrations.
It converges the meeting experience across Webex applications and devices, and unlocks potential for continuous collaboration before and after a meeting, with rich real-time experiences.
If your meetings aren't running on the Video Mesh-ready meeting platform, see What's New in meetings.
