Disable User Profile Pictures in the Webex Meetings in Cisco Webex Control Hub
Site administrators in Control Hub can disable profile pictures in the Webex Meetings so that everyone has their initials as their profile picture.
The meeting application pulls profile pictures from Webex user profiles. If the user doesn't have an account or hasn't uploaded a profile picture, the meeting application uses a generic profile picture. You can disable unique profile pictures for Webex Meetings.
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Services.
2
Under Meeting, select Sites, choose your site, and then select Configure Site.
3
Under Common Settings, select Site Options.
4
Uncheck Display user avatars in the meeting client (Meetings).
Generic profile pictures that are comprised of the first letters of the participant's first and last names appear for all participants. The color selection for each profile picture is random.
