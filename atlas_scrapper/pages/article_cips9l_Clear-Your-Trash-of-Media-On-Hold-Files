Clear Your Trash of Media On Hold Files
After you delete files from your Media Manager in Cisco Webex Control Hub, they accumulate in your trash folder. You can still recover files that are in your trash but once you're sure you no longer need them, we recommend that you clear out this folder. This way, you can reuse any of those filenames.
Before you begin
After you delete a file and send it to the trash, we recommend that you wait a minimum of 24 hours before removing it from your trash altogether. By following this simple guideline, you can avoid deleting a file that may be in use.
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Services > Call > Settings, scroll to Company Media On Hold, and then click Media Manager.
2
Click and then click Delete All.
The files are permanently deleted and no longer recoverable.
