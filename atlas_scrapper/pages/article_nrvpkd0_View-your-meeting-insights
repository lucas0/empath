View your meeting insights
View your meeting Insights to better understand your meeting usage. Insights include average meeting length, number of participants, number of meetings, and more.
From the the Insights section of More features menu in User Hub, you can see a graph of meetings you hosted recently and the number of participants in those meetings.
The Insights page has two graphs:
Meetings I hosted—Shows how many meetings you've hosted, including total minutes spent in those meetings. It also includes the weekly average for the number of meetings and their durations.
Click the drop-down arrow above the graph to change the timeframe for the graph.
Participants in meetings I hosted—Shows how many participants were in your meetings, average number of participants, and meetings with the most and fewest participants.
Click the drop-down arrow above the graph to change the timeframe for the graph.
