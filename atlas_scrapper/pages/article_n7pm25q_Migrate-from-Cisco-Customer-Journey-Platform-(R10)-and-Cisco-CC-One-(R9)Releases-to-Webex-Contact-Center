Migrate from Cisco Customer Journey Platform (R10) and Cisco CC-One (R9) Releases to Webex Contact Center
In this article
Introduction
You can migrate from the legacy Cisco Customer Journey Platform (R10) and Cisco CC-One (R9) releases to Webex Contact Center (new platform). This migration enables access to new features and bug fixes.
You enroll in the migration program and Cisco provides you with a Migation Workspace with these capabilities:
Migrate tenant configuration
You export the platform configuration data from your legacy tenant into a set of comma-separated value (CSV) files. You update entries in the CSV files that match your requirements for your new Webex Contact Center tenant. After the CSV files are ready, you upload them to Control Hub using the Bulk Operations feature. For more information about Bulk Operations, see Bulk Operations in Webex Contact Center.
Historical data
You can access Analyzer-based data from the legacy platform. This provides compliance and historical reporting information. The following data sources are available:
Customer Session Record
Customer Activity Record
Agent Session Record
Agent Activity Record
Call recordings
You can access call recordings from the legacy platform. You access call recordings for compliance or to review past customer interactions.
