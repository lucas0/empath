Customize your webinar using stage manager
Make your webinar look and feel polished and professional by setting a background, logo, and customized name labels. Give your webinar a specific theme for a special event or use the logo and background to match your company branding.
As the webinar host or cohost, you can customize three aspects of your webinar with the stage manager. Set the stage background image that displays behind everything on your stage, choose a logo and its location on the stage, and choose the look and behavior of everyone's display name. Customize your webinar when you schedule it, or at any time during the webinar.

  The stage manager has the following limitations:
The customized stage doesn't appear for people who join using a video device.
Webinars in webcast view don't support the stage manager.
If a panelist calls in to the webinar, the display name and subtitle given to them by the host don't appear.
Customize your stage when scheduling
Keep your customization options for future webinars by saving your webinar as a template. The customization options you make appear for attendees when you sync your stage with everyone during the webinar.
Before you begin
Schedule your webinar.

From your Webex site, click Webinars, then select your webinar.

In the Stage manager section, click Edit.

in the Stage background section, choose an existing background or click + and select an image from your computer.

  Use the preview options below the image to see how your background looks when there's video only, or when there's shared content.
4
In the Logo section, click +, then choose a logo image on your computer.
Drag the slider to adjust the logo size, then click Apply.

Manage the stage during a webinar
Start and stop syncing your stage and change your background, logo, or name label style as needed from the stage manager panel.
