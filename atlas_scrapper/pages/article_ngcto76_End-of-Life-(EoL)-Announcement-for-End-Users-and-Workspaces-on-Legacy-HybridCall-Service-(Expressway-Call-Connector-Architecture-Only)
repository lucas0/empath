End of Life (EoL) Announcement for End Users and Workspaces on Legacy Hybrid Call Service (Expressway Call Connector Architecture Only)
As of June 30, 2021, the Webex app (formerly Webex Teams) end users, Workspaces, and personal mode devices using the legacy Hybrid Call Service connected to Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) through the Expressway Call Connector went End of Life (EoL) for all customers. As of this EoL date, calls made through the legacy Hybrid Call Service will not work for users in the Webex app, on personal mode devices, or on shared mode devices because the service will be fully shut down. Customers must configure the Webex app to register directly to Unified CM for enterprise calling capabilities for their users as soon as possible.
First Published: April 6, 2021
See the End of Support announcement for our previous announcement from March 2021.
See the following table to understand what works for call service for users and devices after the Call Connector architecture is no longer supported:

  This EoL notice only applies to Hybrid Call Service on the Call Connector architecture. This notice does not impact customers who run other Hybrid Services, including the Device Connector architecture.

Impact
Webex app users—After the EoL deadline listed above, calls in the Webex App app on the Call Connector architecture will no longer work for users, the Call Connector solution will no longer be officially available, and the service will be officially shut down.
As covered in this previous announcement, the service was End of Support (EoS) on March, 31 2021. After EoS, all customer organizations that are created in Webex Control Hub will longer be able to set up the legacy Hybrid Call Service with the Expressway Call Connector architecture for enterprise calling integration with the Webex App app.
User devices—After the EoL deadline listed above, Personal Mode devices associated with users will no longer have PSTN access through the Call Connector solution.
Requirement
If existing customers need enterprise calling capabilities in Webex App, they must deploy Calling in Webex App (Unified CM) for continued support. This solution provides softphone capability to Webex App users. In this architecture, the Webex App app registers directly to Unified CM.
When Webex App is registered with Unified CM, the solution provides enterprise calling capabilities—audio/video calls and mid-call features such as mute, consultative transfer, merge/conference, sharing, and so on. Direct access to call settings such as call forwarding (CFA), single number reach (SNR) and visual voicemail is also supported. The Webex App app also interfaces with Unified CM-registered desk phones to provide remote call control capabilities in Deskphone Control (DPC) mode. For a full list of supported features, see the Calling Features section in the deployment guide.
Additionally, customer administrators can now set up call preferences for the organization to prioritize enterprise calling work numbers or Enterprise SIP URIs with a Single Click option. This simplifies the end user calling experience. Enterprise calling between users alerts remote users on their Webex App client and IP phones for a consistent call alert experience.
Direct registration to Unified CM provides these benefits:
Direct connection to Unified CM leading to a faster connect time than the Call Connector solution
Direct media when Webex App apps are local within enterprise network
Additional calling capabilities with a roadmap towards Jabber calling feature parity
Reuse of existing Mobile and Remote Access (MRA) and Jabber Client Services Framework (CSF) configuration for client-side integration (unlike the server-side integration in the Call Connector architecture)
Next Steps Before the Deadline
Webex app users—As soon as possible before the End of Life deadline, customers that are currently deployed with legacy Hybrid Call Service for end users must migrate to Calling in Webex App (Unified CM) to avoid service impact and continue to have calling functionality in the Webex App app.
User devices
For users who have personal mode devices configured and enabled for PSTN access: If those users do not require PSTN any more, you can leave these devices as they are. No further steps are required.
If the users require PSTN support, you must manually move to the Webex Device Connector solution as soon as possible before the End of Life deadline. You can then use Webex Control Hub to enable Hybrid Calling (Device Connector) for the Personal Mode devices.
