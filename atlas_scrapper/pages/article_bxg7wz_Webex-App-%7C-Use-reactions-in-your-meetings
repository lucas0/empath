Webex App | Use reactions in your meetings
Express yourself during a Webex meeting. With the click of a button, you can cheer on the speaker with the clapping hands reaction or appreciate a joke with the laughing emoji. If you're in a meeting on your desktop app, you can even enable gestures. The app recognizes and converts your hand movements into reactions.
This feature is available in Webex scheduled meetings, Personal Room meetings, and enhanced meetings associated with a space.
Meeting hosts and cohosts can turn off reactions so this feature may not be available to you. Hosts and cohosts can also hide the display name that shows next to reactions on meeting platforms that support Edge Video Mesh.
For gesture reactions, such as thumbs up, you can choose the skin tone you prefer.

If you want to enable gestures, make sure you're sharing your video and that your computer meets the following requirements:
Operating System—Windows 10 version 10.0.17763 or later
Processor—four physical cores or more
Memory—4 GB or more of RAM
Click Reactions and then choose one of the following options:
Choose an emoji.
Turn on Recognize hand gestures. Then, if you have a question, you can physically raise your hand in front of your camera. Hold the gesture until the blue circle is drawn on the screen and the reaction animation plays. The app recognizes your gesture (raised hand, thumbs up, thumbs down, and clapping hands) and shares it with everyone in the meeting.
If you stop making the gesture before the animation plays, your gesture won't be shared.
If you changed your mind and no longer want to raise your hand, click Reactions and select Lower hand.
Others see your reaction in the lower-right corner of your video or in the lower-left corner of the meeting window along with your name, depending on whether your video is within view.
