Annotate in Webex meetings, webinars, events, and training sessions
If you’re wondering how to bring attention to content that you're sharing, this article is for you! Use text, lines, shapes, and color options from the Annotate toolbar to draw attention to things you want to point out on content that’s being shared.
Anyone can share and annotate content in a meeting. Only presenters can share and annotate content in meetings, webinars and events.

  This feature is not available for webinars in webcast view.
You can annotate several things in your meetings; for example, you can share your screen and annotate whatever is visible on it. You can also upload a document to the meeting to annotate with your meeting participants. Learn more about sharing content here: Share content in Webex Meetings, Webex Webinars, and Webex Events (classic).
To collaborate together and use a whiteboard in a meeting, see Use the whiteboard in Webex Meetings .
Before you can start annotating, you need to enable the Annotate toolbar in one of the following ways:
If you're sharing your screen, go to the Controls panel at the right of your screen and click Annotate.
If you're sharing a document, but not your screen, click Annotation on the Controls panel at the top.
The Annotate toolbar appears on the top of your meeting. See the Annotate toolbar table below for a detailed list of your annotate options.
