Webex App | Add emoji reactions to messages
You can respond to someone's message with an emoji reaction. You can use reactions to let people know that you like a post, to show excitement, or to have some fun.

Web
Hover on a message and click , then select an emoji reaction from the emoji library. Choose from different categories, select color tones, and search for an emoji using the search box.
When you add a reaction, it appears below the original message, if you want to remove your reaction just click on it again.
You can add three reactions to any message, and if you hover over a reaction, you can see who added it.

  Webex App 43.6 is the minimum supported version for displaying reactions from the new emoji library.
