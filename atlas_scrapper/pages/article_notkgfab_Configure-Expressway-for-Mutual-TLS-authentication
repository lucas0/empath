Configure Expressway for Mutual TLS authentication
If your users have Webex on-premises video devices, configure Cisco Expressway for Mutual TLS (mTLS). You can then allow users to host and join scheduled and Personal Room meetings from video devices within your own organization.
To host Webex Meetings without a PIN on on-premises devices, your Cisco Expressway-E must offer signed certificates from a trusted Root Certificate Authorities (RCA) for Mutual TLS (mTLS) connections. You can find the list of root CAs that Cisco trusts in this article. We only allow connections that have valid signed certificates.

  If you use your Expressway-E for Webex for Government, you must enable mTLS.
