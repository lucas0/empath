Get started with your Cisco Headset 720 Series
The Cisco Headset 720 Series is a series of headsets that use Bluetooth Â® connectivity to pair with Cisco soft clients and devices. The Cisco Headset 721 features a single ear cup for extended use and comfort, while the Cisco Headset 722 features a full stereo experience.
In addition to integrated call controls, both headsets come with a customizable multifunction button. By default, the multifunction button controls music playback. However, you can reprogram the button through the Cisco Headsets mobile app to activate a mobile assistant such as Siri or Google Assistant.
The Cisco Headset 720 Series also features an integrated Webex button. Use the Webex button to bring the Webex App window to the top of your desktop screen or to join upcoming meetings.
The 720 Series is also available in a version certified for use with Microsoft Teams. See Cisco Headset 720 Series call controls for complete Microsoft Teams call control information.
