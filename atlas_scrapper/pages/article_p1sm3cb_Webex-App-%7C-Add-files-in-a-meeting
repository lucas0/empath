Webex App | Add files in a meeting
Collaborate with your colleagues and upload files for all other participants, and everyone can download the files you share. Hosts and cohosts can turn off the ability for everyone to add files at any stage of the meeting.
This feature is available on our Video Mesh-ready meeting platform. Find out if your meetings use the Video Mesh-ready meeting platform.
Add a file
When you join a meeting, you can see all the files that were added since the start of the meeting. If you don't lock your Personal Room and don't end your meeting, anyone who joins can see all the files added during the previous meetings in your Personal Room. Any files added in a meeting are only available during the meeting, and don't appear in the post-meeting summary.
