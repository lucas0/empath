Configure a Static IP Address
Your device uses Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) for IP addresses, which means that the address may change when you sign in. DHCP is the default, but you can configure a static or fixed IP address if you want your address to remain the same. Some administrators prefer static IP addresses because they can assign specific addresses to each location or device.
You are successful when the new address loads on your browser and the device registers or activates. But if you have a problem, then do a factory reset and repeat the configuration task.

  You cannot change the setting for static IP after the device registers. You can only set a device's static IP before you register the device.
Before you begin
We recommend that you complete the following tasks before you configure your static IP address:
Connect your device to your network and register or activate it.
Verify that your static IP address is unique and not used by another device.
Obtain the IP address for your device.
You also need a laptop or mobile device with a browser and an Internet connection.
