Webex App | Add a website shortcut to a space
You can keep important information right where your team needs it, by adding a website shortcut to a space. Members can then click on a tab to open and browse a website from inside their Webex App space. If you don't see this feature, contact your administrator for more information.
1
Go to Messaging and select the space.
2
Click Apps +, and then Add a website.
In moderated spaces, only moderators have the the Apps + tab. If you can't add a website shortcut, try asking a space moderator for help.
3
Enter a name for the shortcut and the website address.
4
Click Continue.

  Right-click the tab name for additional menu options, if you want to make changes to a website shortcut.
