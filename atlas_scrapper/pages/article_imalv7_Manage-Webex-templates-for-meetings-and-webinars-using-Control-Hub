Manage Webex templates for meetings and webinars using Control Hub
Webex site administrators can save commonly used settings as templates. Hosts can use those templates to send invites without having to enter the same settings each time.
Scheduling templates overview
A scheduling template defines many of the settings for a meeting or webinar scheduled from the Webex site. If hosts often use the same settings for their meetings or webinars, a site administrator can save those settings in a template. During scheduling, hosts can select a template, so they don't have to set many of the same options for each meeting or webinar.
There are two types of scheduling templates:
Standard scheduling templates: Available for all hosts. A Webex service includes a set of standard templates. Site administrators can also make personal templates, created by hosts, available as standard templates.
Personal scheduling templates: A template that a host sets up and that is available only for that host. A host can create a personal template from within the meeting scheduler, by using the Save As Template option. When saving a template, the host can also save the template as a standard template, by selecting Save As Standard Template. The template then appears in the list of standard templates.
In the list of standard templates for Webex Meetings or Webex Webinars, site administrators can:
Show or hide any standard template, including those templates that hosts create and save as a standard template.
Make any standard template the default template for Webex Meetings or Webex Webinars.
Delete a standard template from a Webex site.

  Make the same changes for each language if you want your site to be consistent for every language. For example, the changes you make in English don't appear when you sign in to your site in French.
