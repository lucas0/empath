Webex Cloud-Connected UC Directory Service support for Unified CM
In this article
Webex Cloud-Connected UC Directory Service support
You can synchronize and manage users from cloud Active Directory (for example, Azure AD) into on-premises or cloud hosted UC infrastructure like Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified Communications Manager) and Cisco Unity Connection (Unity Connection) with the Webex Cloud-Connected UC Directory Service. During synchronization, the system imports a list of users and associated user data from the Azure Active Directory (or a similar Cloud Directory service) that is synchronized into the Webex Common Identity Service. You must select the Unified CM cluster from Control Hub that needs synchronization, select the appropriate Unified CM User ID field mapping, and then select the required synchronization agreement to perform synchronization.
Prerequisite
Onboard the Unified CM clusters to Cloud-Connected UC. See Set Up Cloud-Connected UC for On-Premises Devices

Unified Communications Manager clusters must be version 11.5(1)SU9, 12.5(1)SU4, or 14 and later
