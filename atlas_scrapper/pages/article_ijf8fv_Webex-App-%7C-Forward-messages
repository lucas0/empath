Webex App | Forward messages
Sometimes you see a message in one space and want to share it with people in another. You might be chatting directly with someone, but something comes up in that conversation that you'd like to discuss with others. You can share that message, and any attached files, to anyone or any space and keep the conversation going.

  Forward messages with content is currently not supported on Webex for Government.
You can still forward messages that include files, GIFs and images. However, the content won't be displayed, but you'll see the file type that was shared in the original message.
