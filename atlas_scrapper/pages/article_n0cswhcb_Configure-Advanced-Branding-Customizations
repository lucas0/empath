Configure Advanced Branding Customizations
You can change the way Webex looks for your customers' users by adding your logo, color palette, and linking the app to your "fine print", help, and feedback resources. You have an option to enable customers to override some of this branding. Two branding settings are available: Basic customization and Advanced customization. You can choose the branding type that applies to your company.
Partner administrators can use Advanced Branding Customizations to customize how the Webex App looks for the customer organizations that the partner manages. Partner administrators can customize the following settings to ensure that the Webex App reflects their company brand and identity:
Company logos
Unique Color Schemes for Light mode or Dark mode
Customized Support URLs
By default, partner-level branding gets applied to all customer organizations that the partner manages. You also have the option to specify whether customer administrators can override your settings for their own organization.

  Partner Hub currently displays two branding tabs: Basic customization and Advanced customization. By default, the Basic customization tab is selected. You can configure one of the options only—not both. The Advanced Customization settings are recommended as they provide a wider range of customizations.
Advanced Branding Configuration Overview
Advanced Branding settings can be applied in the following contexts, with each context setting branding for different groups of users:
Partner Organization only—Applies only to users in partner organization (the organization titled "My Organization" in Partner Hub).
Partner-level Branding (all customers)—Sets default branding for all customers that inherit the partner's branding.
Partner-defined Branding (for single customer)—If needed, sets branding for a single customer. Overrides partner-level defaults.
Customer Branding—Customer administrators can override Partner Branding only if the partner administrator enables this option.
Recommended Configuration Order
Following is the recommended order for applying Branding to customer organizations:
Partner-defined Branding (for single customer)—If you want to define unique settings for a single customer organization, configure Branding for that customer before you set partner-level defaults.
Partner-level Branding (all customers)—Configure partner-level Branding that applies as default branding for all customer organizations.
Customer Branding—If partner administrator enables the override option, customer administrators can apply Branding to their own organization, overriding partner settings.
Branding for the partner’s own organization is applied separately from settings for customer organizations and does not need to follow this order.
Configure Advanced Branding
Partner administrators can use this procedure to configure Advanced Branding settings that apply either to customer organizations that the partner manages or to the partner organization itself.
Note that Branding for the partner's own organization (the organization titled "My Organization" in Partner Hub) must be configured separately from Branding that gets applied to customer organizations that the partner manages.
Before you begin

  If you have some customer organizations where you want to apply unique Branding settings and others that will use Partner Level branding, configure Branding for the individual customer organizations before you configure Partner-level Branding (for all customer organizations).
1
Sign in to Partner Hub and then complete one of the following steps, depending on the group to which you want to apply settings:
For Partner-level Branding (for all customers)—Click Settings.
For Partner-defined Branding (for a single customer)—Launch the Customer view for that organization and click Organization Settings.
For Partner organization only—Launch view for “My Organization” and click Organization Settings.
2
Under Branding, select the Advanced customization tab and click Customize Branding to configure the settings.

  By default, the Basic customization tab is selected.
3
On the General tab, edit the following settings:
Branding—Enter a brand name. The name that you enter becomes part of the offering name on the About page (for example, "Acme on Cisco Webex").
Dark mode visibility—Enable this toggle if you want users to be able to use Dark mode. Otherwise, only Light mode is available to users.
4
On the Logos tab, add the logos that you want to use for Light mode and Dark mode.
5
On the Colors tab, input the hexadecimal color schemes that you want to apply for Light mode and Dark mode. You can input a separate color scheme for each mode.
The image maps how each color setting gets applied to the Webex App. You can use the toggle and the tabs to switch the image between Light mode and Dark mode on various platforms (for example, Windows, iOS, Android). For a detailed summary of the settings, see Branding Outcomes for Users.
6
On the Support Links tab, enter the customized URLs that you want to use for various legal disclaimers and forgotten passwords.
7
On the Emergency Call Disclaimer tab, configure settings for the disclaimer. For details on how to configure the disclaimer, see Emergency Call Disclaimer.
8
Click Publish Changes.
The new branding is not immediately visible to users whose organizations are in different datacenters to your partner organization. There is a daily refresh across the datacenters, so the branding can take up to 24 hours to propagate to all users.
9
Optional. Check the Enable all customers (this customer) to use their own logo and color check box if you want to allow customer administrators to override your settings (the default is unchecked).
10
Repeat the procedure if you want to configure Advanced Branding for one of the other options outlined in Step 1.

  Your logo gets added to both the Navigation bar and to the About window in Webex on Desktop. Logos do not display for either Mobile or Tablet applications.
Click Reset to default branding to return to the default branding settings. For partner administrators configuring partner-level branding for customer organizations, this button resets branding to Cisco default settings. For customer administrators, the button returns branding to partner-level brading settings.
The Reset to default branding button is not available to partner administrators when configuring branding that applies to the partner organization.
Partner-level branding gets applied only to customer organizations that the partner manages. Partner branding does not get applied to the partner organization itself, titled “My Organization” in Partner Hub.
If you disable customer branding altogether, customer administrators do not see the Branding section in their organization settings.
Webex for Cisco BroadWorks only. The Colors tab contains additional buttons: Sign-in (for the User Activation Portal) and Email (for Email login). However, this option must be turned on by Cisco TAC or these settings do not appear.
Rules for Customer Inheritance of Partner Branding
As partner administrator, you must decide whether you want customer administrators to be able to override your Branding settings and add their own logos and colors. The following conditions apply:
By default, customer organizations inherit partner-level Branding as the default branding settings.
Once unique Branding settings are applied to a specific customer organization (whether by a customer administrator or by a partner administrator), the relationship is broken. Any further edits to partner-level branding have no effect on branding settings for the customer organization.
To reset a customer organization’s branding to partner-level branding defaults, a partner administrator or customer administrator must open the Advanced Branding settings for that customer organization and click Reset to default branding.
Branding Settings Access for Admins
The following table outlines the level of access partner administrators and customer organization administrators have to edit or view Branding settings. There are three levels of access: Editable, Read Only, and Not visible (cannot read or edit settings).
For customer organization administrators, edit access depends on whether the partner administrator gives that customer organization the ability to override Partner Branding. The following settings determine whether the override is enabled:
Enable all customers to use their own logo and color—Configured by partner administrator in partner-level Branding settings. When enabled, customer administrators at all customer organizations that inherit the partner-level Branding defaults can override the partner settings. By default, this setting applies to all customer organizations the partner manages unless a unique Branding configuration is applied to that specific organization).

  This setting exists separately for Basic and Advanced Customization. The Basic setting applies only to customer organizations that are assigned Basic Branding while the Advanced setting applies only to customer organizations that are assigned Advanced Customization.
Enable this customer to use their own logo and color—Configured by partner administrator in Branding settings for a specific customer organization. When this option is checked, customer administrators for this customer organization can override the partner-defined setting.

Branding Conflicts
If a branding conflict exists, we display only the Cisco branding in the Webex App. Branding conflicts occur when two partners, both of whom have branding set up, deliver non-conflicting services to the same customer organization. For example, one partner assigns Webex Calling to a customer organization while a different partner assigns Webex for BroadWorks services to the same customer organization. Either partner can open a TAC case in order to determine which partner branding applies. Also note that if only one of the two partners has configured branding, then no branding conflict exists.
Add Help Site and Feedback URLs
Partner administrators can use this procedure to assign custom Help Site and Feedback URLs that launch when users click the appropriate options from the Webex App:
Help URL—Launches when a user clicks the (?) icon or when the user selects Help > Webex Help from the toolbar.
Feedback URL—Launches when a user clicks Send Feedback from the About window or when a user selects Help > Send Feedback from the toolbar.

Sign in to Partner Hub and then complete one of the following options, depending on which set of users will use these settings:

Specific customer (overrides partner-level defaults)—Launch the Customer view for that customer and click Organization Settings.

Under Customize support information, enter Contact support info:
For the problem report URL enter the feedback URL that launches when users click Send Feedback from the Webex App.
Enter any additional support information (for example, phone numbers or email addresses). Note that this information displays in the Meeting site rather than on the Webex App.
Click Save.
