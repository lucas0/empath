Turn on the Q&A feature in Slido
As a Webex Meetings or Webex Webinars host, when you turn on the Q&A feature in Slido, participants see the Q&A panel open in the meeting window, and they can start to ask questions.
Slido is available in Webex Meetings. You can use Slido in plans for up to 10,000 users in Webex Webinars on version 41.9 and later sites. Slido polls are available for up to 10,000 attendees, while quizzes are available for up to 5,000 users.
By default, Q&A is turned off.
1
During a meeting or webinar, go to Apps > Slido.
2
Select an existing Slido or create a new one.
3
Click the Q&A tab, and then click Enable Q&A to make the Q&A session live.
Change the Q&A settings, if you want to customize your Q&A session.
If you donâ€™t want to use the Q&A feature any longer, click > Settings. Under Features, click Audience Q&A, toggle off the feature, and then click Save.

If you don't want participants to send any more questions but you still want to discuss and display the current questions, close the Q&A session instead of turning it off.
