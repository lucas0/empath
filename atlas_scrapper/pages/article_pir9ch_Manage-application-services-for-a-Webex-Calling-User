Manage application services for a Webex Calling User
Application services let you determine the ringing behavior for calls that are made to users in certain scenarios such as when a Click to Dial call is made, or while receiving group pages or when a parked call is recalled back to the user’s line.
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Users and select the user that you want to edit.
2
Go to Calling > User Call Experience > Application line Assignments.
3
Under Ring settings, choose the ringing behavior for the user's devices in these scenarios:
Click to Dial calls are made—Notifies the user of incoming click-to-dial calls on the Webex Calling application.
Group Pages are received—Notifies the user when group paging calls are made on the Webex Calling application.
A call is parked on this user's line—Notifies the user when a call is parked on their line.
4
Under Webex application assignments, choose the available devices that are licensed with the Webex Calling application for the user.

  The Webex Callingapplication can’t be used on these devices unless the user has the calling license assigned.
