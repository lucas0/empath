Webex App | Record your phone calls
Your administrator determines how much control you have over recording your calls. Depending on your setup, your incoming and outgoing calls may be recorded automatically, or you may be able to decide which calls you want to record. You're presented with a visual indicator letting you know when a call is being recorded.
