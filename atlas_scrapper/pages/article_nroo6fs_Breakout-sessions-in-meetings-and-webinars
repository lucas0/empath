Breakout sessions in meetings and webinars
Breakout sessions are smaller groups that are split off from the main meeting or webinar. Use breakout sessions for workshops, classrooms, or for when you need a moment to talk privately with a few participants outside of the main session.
This feature is supported on Webex Meetings and Webex Webinars. On Webex App, this feature is available on our Video Mesh-ready meeting platform. Find out if your meetings use the Video Mesh-ready meeting platform.

Roles in a breakout session
In meetings, hosts and cohosts create breakout sessions, assign participants, and start the sessions when they're ready.
Attendees can share content and use collaboration tools such as chat to collaborate in smaller, more focused discussion groups. See Best practices for participating in breakout sessions.
Audio and video in breakout sessions
Each breakout session is a separate audio and video conference. If you connected to audio when you joined the meeting or webinar, it switches over automatically when you join a breakout session. In meetings, you can mute or unmute your audio and start or stop your video at any time during the breakout session, just like you would in the main meeting.

  If you join a meeting from a room device, pressing Mute device or Unmute device mutes or unmutes the entire room.
When all breakout sessions end, your audio switches to the main session automatically. In meetings, if your video was on during the breakout session, it remains on when all breakout sessions end and you return to the main session.
