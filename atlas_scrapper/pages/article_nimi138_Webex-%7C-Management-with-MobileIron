Webex | Management with MobileIron
In this article
As an administrator, you can use the Webex integration with MobileIron to provision and manage the Webex App from the MobileIron cloud console.
Overview
Webex supports integration with Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) tools such as MobileIron (now Ivanti). These tools allow you to provision, configure and control access to mobile applications deployed in your organization. They also allow you to monitor, manage and secure corporate mobile devices used in your organization.
You can use Ivanti to enrol and manage Cisco Webex on personally owned devices (BYOD) and corporate phones.
This document helps you import Cisco Webex (for iOS or Android) into your MobileIron app catalog, configure the app, and distribute it to users.
Prerequisites
Ensure that you have access to the MobileIron cloud console.
You must have a Webex account.
If Android devices are enrolled, ensure that they are enrolled in MobileIron cloud with the appropriate Android Enterprise Deployment mode (Work profile, Device owner (DO), or Corporate Owned Personally Enabled (COPE)) and that they are compliant with your organization's compliance policy.
