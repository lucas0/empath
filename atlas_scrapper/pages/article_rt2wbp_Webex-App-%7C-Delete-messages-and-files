Webex App | Delete messages and files
In Webex App, if you mistype a message or send the wrong file, you can delete them even after you've sent them. And, if you're the space moderator, you can delete other people's messages and files, too.
Desktop
iPhone and iPad
Android
Web
Hover over your message and click More actions, then click Delete message. If you sent a message and a file, clicking Delete message will delete both.

  You'll see the delete option on other people's messages and files, if you're the space moderator.
