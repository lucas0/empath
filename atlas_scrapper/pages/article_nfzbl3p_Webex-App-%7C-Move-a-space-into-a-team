Webex App | Move a space into a team
Some spaces benefit from being opened up to a larger group of people. By moving your space into a team, you can make it easier for team members to join the conversation.
When you move a space into a team, anyone who's not already part of the team will be considered a guest. They won't be able to use other team spaces.
You can't move a space into a team if:
The space is moderated, but you aren't a moderator.
The space is part of another team.
The space is moderated, but the space moderators are not members of the targeted team.
