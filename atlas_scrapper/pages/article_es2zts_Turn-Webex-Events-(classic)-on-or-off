Turn Webex Events (classic) on or off
You can allow Webex Events (classic) for your Webex site, and permit users to choose the Events service that they prefer. If your organization prefers to have everyone use Webex Webinars, you can disable Events (classic).
1
Sign in to Webex Site Administration and go to Configuration > Common Site Settings > Options.
2
Scroll to the Site Options section, and do one of the following:
Check Enable Classic Event.
Uncheck Enable Classic Event.
If you choose not to allow Events (classic) for your site, the Webex Events (classic) link disappears from the left navigation menu. Hosts can no longer start previously scheduled events from the Webex site, but can start them from their calendar application or event email. Hosts can still access any of their Events (classic) reports from events they have held in the past.
