Adjust how many participants appear in grid view in meetings, webinars, and events
Set how many participants appear in grid view at a time and how big you want them to appear in Webex Meetings, Webex Webinars, and Webex Events (classic).
Desktop, Web
iOS
Android
Grid view automatically adjusts to the number of participants that attend your meeting. By increasing or decreasing the number of participants that appear, you set the maximum number that can appear per page. When fully zoomed out, up to 81 participants can appear on-screen together for the desktop app, and up to six for the web app. When fully zoomed in, only one participant per page appears for the desktop and web app. Zooming in or out also increases or decreases the size of the videos in grid view.
Use the slider to increase or decrease the number of people that appear.
Set the default maximum number of grid view videos for the desktop app by going to Show Menu Bar > Meeting > Meeting Settings > Layout.
