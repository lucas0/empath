Description
Allows you to move the annotation panel within the meeting interface for convenient access to annotation tools.
Allows you to control your screen and move your mouse pointer. It does not make any changes or annotations on the screen.
Allows you to draw or write on the screen using laser ink. However, the ink automatically disappears after a short period of time, allowing you to temporarily highlight or emphasize something without permanently marking the screen.

  This feature isn't supported for Webex for Government.
Allows you to draw or write on the screen using laser ink. The strokes made with the pen tool stay on the screen until they are manually cleared or saved.
Allows you to remove or erase any annotations or strokes made on the screen. You can select the eraser and then click on an annotation to remove it.
Allows you to reverse or undo the last annotation or action performed. It helps you correct any mistakes or remove an annotation you didn't intend to make.
Allows you to reapply an annotation or action that was previously undone using the undo tool. It is used to restore an annotation or action that was mistakenly removed.
Provides options to remove annotations from the screen. It includes the following sub-options:
Clear all annotations: Removes all annotations made by any participant on the screen.
Clear my annotations: Removes only the annotations made by you.
Clear other participants' annotations: Removes the annotations made by other participants, but not your own.
Allows you to capture a screenshot of the screen with all the annotations and save it to your Downloads folder.
Allows you to manage the annotation permissions for participants. It includes the following options:
Anyone can annotate: Allows all participants to make annotations on the screen without any approval.
Others need to ask for approval: Participants must request permission to make annotations, and the host or presenter can approve or deny the requests.
Block all requests to annotate: Disables annotation privileges for all participants.
Provides options to stop or cancel the annotation session.
