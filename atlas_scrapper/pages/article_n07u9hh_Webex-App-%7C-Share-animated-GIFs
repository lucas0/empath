Webex App | Share animated GIFs
You can share animated GIFs by accessing GIPHY directly from the app, so you can find just the right GIF to personalize your message. If you don't see the GIF option, then your administrator has disabled it.

  This feature is supported on Safari and Chrome, but not Firefox.

When writing a message, select , to open the GIPHY library (which we've limited to images rated G) and enter a keyword or phrase to search for a GIF. Then, select the animated GIF to add it to your message, and send your message.
When you send a GIF, it plays automatically, but it stops looping after a few seconds. People in the space can replay the GIF if they want.

  You can always delete the GIF after everyone's seen it to help reduce distractions in the space.
