Webex App | Add or remove a cohost from a meeting
As a host, you can assign the cohost role to one or more attendees during a meeting. A cohost can help manage the meeting, especially when there are many attendees.
You can assign an attendee the cohost role during a scheduled meeting, a Personal Room meeting, and an enhanced meeting associated with a space.
For enhanced meetings associated with a space, people internal to the organization are automatically made cohosts during scheduling. They need an account with host privileges on the site where the meeting is scheduled from. External members of the space can only be made hosts or cohosts after the meeting starts.
When you make someone a cohost of a meeting, you're letting them:
Mute and unmute all or specific attendees
Record the meeting
Admit people from the lobby
Remove an attendee from a meeting
Lower a raised hand
Assign the presenter role to another attendee
End the meeting
Cohosts who you assign when you schedule meetings from your Webex site can also start a meeting.
