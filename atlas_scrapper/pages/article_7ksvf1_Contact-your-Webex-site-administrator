Contact your Webex site administrator
For help with user account issues, such as password resets, locked-out accounts, and account reactivation, contact your site administrator. Your site administrator can also answer questions about the features available on your Webex site.
Your site administrator is the person who sets up and manages your Webex site. They also set up your account and manage your account settings.

If you're on the Webex Free plan, you don't have a Webex site administrator. Open a case for help with your account.
If the contact information for your site administrators isn’t available on your Webex site, you can use your company help desk to reach them.
