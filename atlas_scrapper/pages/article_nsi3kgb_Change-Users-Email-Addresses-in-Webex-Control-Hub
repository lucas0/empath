Change Users Email Addresses in Webex Control Hub
Need to update a user’s email address because of a name change? Does a user need to correct their email address? Whatever the reason is, you can change a user’s current email address in Control Hub.
When you change a user’s email address, they'll have 15 days to verify if the new email address is correct. If the user doesn't verify the changes, then the email address changes back to the original one.
You can also add alternative email addresses so that users can sign in using an alias, or alternate email address. This can be useful when a user has one email address for signing in, but another email address to manage their calendar. You must ensure the email address for calendar management maps to the primary email address field in Webex. Add the other email address (the userPrincipalName, for example) as an alternative email address. The alternative email addresses must be from a verified domain within your organization, and it must be unique and not assigned to another user.

  If you use Cisco Directory Connector for user synchronization, you can't change a user's email address or alternative email address in Control Hub. You must manage user accounts from Active Directory and then resync the changes to Control Hub. See Map User Attributes in the Deployment Guide for Directory Connector.
