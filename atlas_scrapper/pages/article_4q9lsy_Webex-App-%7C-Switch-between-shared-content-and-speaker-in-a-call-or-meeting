Webex App | Switch between shared content and speaker in a call or meeting
When someone is sharing content in a call or meeting, you can expand the shared content to full-screen view and then switch between the shared content or the speaker. That way, you can focus on the shared content, when it's being discussed, and on the speaker, when it's not.
Windows and Mac
Web
When you join a meeting in Webex App and someone shares content, the shared content appears in the center of the screen and video of the meeting participants appears at the top of the screen.
If the meeting already has 20 people, anyone else who joins sees the shared content and the active speaker's video appear side by side.
1
Select Zoom view to see the shared content in full-screen view.
If the thumbnail videos are covering the shared content, drag the floating panel to another location on the screen.
2
Select Swap shared content view with video view in the floating panel to switch focus between the shared content and the active speaker's video.
Select Hide video view in the floating panel to hide all thumbnails videos. The name of the active speaker shows in the floating panel.
Select Focus view in the floating panel to show the active speaker's video only.
Select Grid view in the floating panel to show the videos of the meeting participants.

  Resize the floating panel to see more of the participants or more of the shared content during a meeting. Move your cursor over any edge of the panel until an arrow appears, and then drag to make the panel larger or smaller.
