Respond to inactivity timer
If you don’t perform any activity when you’re in Available or Idle states, you’re considered inactive and are signed out of Webex Contact Center. Make sure you’re able to receive calls by responding to the inactivity timer.
Your administrator configures an inactivity timeout value. If you're inactive for that specified duration, you're automatically signed out of Webex Contact Center. Activity includes handling contacts, working on custom widgets, or performing any task on the Agent Desktop or Supervisor Desktop.
1
A countdown timer appears on the Prolonged Inactivity dialog box one minute before the configured timeout occurs. Choose one of the following options:
Stay Signed In—Allows you to stay signed in until you sign out before the timer expires.
Sign Out—Allows you to sign out of the Agent Desktop or Supervisor Desktop.

If you are automatically signed out, click OK to close the dialog box.
