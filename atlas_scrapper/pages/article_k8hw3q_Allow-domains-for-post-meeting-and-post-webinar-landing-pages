Allow domains for post-meeting and post-webinar landing pages
Meeting and webinar hosts can specify a URL to open a landing page, such as a survey, after the meeting or webinar ends. Hosts can't save URLs from domains that aren't on the allowed list. To enable this feature, administrators must create a list of allowed domains.
The list of allowed domains is a security measure to ensure that hosts can only specify URLs that resolve to reputable and professional domains. Hosts can then enter these allowed URLs to open a landing page after a meeting or webinar ends.
This feature is not available for webinars in webcast view.

1
Sign in to Webex Site Administration and go to Configuration > Common Site Settings > Options.
2
In the Security Options section, enter the domain names to allow in the Allow the following URL domain names text box.
Separate the domain names with a comma. Webex always includes the webex.com and script.google.com domains. Hosts can't specify a URL from a domain that isn't in this list.

  Do not enter these domains in the larger text box under Enable cross-origin resources sharing (CORS). These URLs apply only to CORS and not to the URL that opens after a meeting or webinar.
