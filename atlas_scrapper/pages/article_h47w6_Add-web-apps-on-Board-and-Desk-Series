Add web apps on Board and Desk Series
You can launch a web app directly from the home screen of some devices. You can add web apps on Control Hub, with the UI Extensions Editor, or directly from the device's Settings menu.
You can define web apps to appear on your device's home screen and open directly from there. Make sure the web engine is on â€“ if not, see this article for more information.
Read Best Practices For Using the Web Engine to learn more about the supported features and limitations of the web engine. If you encounter an issue with a web page, check the Troubleshooting section.
You can set up your Cisco devices to grant permanent access to camera and microphone for defined websites, which will skip the default prompt dialogue. This is especially useful for web apps, as users will not have to allow camera and microphone access via a dialogue every time a call is made. To do so, go to the web portal of the device. Read the Advanced Settings article for more information on how to access it. Then, select Settings from the menu on the left. Under Configurations, choose the following:
WebEngine > MediaAccess > Add Hostname: Enter the websites that will have access to the camera or microphone. The maximum number of entries is 30.
WebEngine > MediaAccess > Add Hostname > Device:
Camera: Allow access to the camera for the defined website.
Microphone: Allow access to the microphone for the defined website.
WebEngine > MediaAccess > List: List all the allowed websites and their associated Webex devices.
WebEngine > MediaAccess > Remove Id: Remove a website with the id from the list of allowed host names. The id is associated with the host and is shown in the result of the list.
WebEngine > MediaAccess > RemoveAll: Remove all the websites from the list of allowed host names.
