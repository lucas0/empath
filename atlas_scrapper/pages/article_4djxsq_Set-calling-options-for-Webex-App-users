Set calling options for Webex App users
You've complete control and flexibility as an administrator in managing different calling deployments with the call settings features in the Control Hub. You can set the priority of different calling options that users see in Webex App and enable single click-to-call.
Call Settings and Single Click
Before you begin
You must have Webex Calling or Unified CM deployed in your organization.
1
Sign in to Control Hub at https://admin.webex.com, and go to Services > Calling > Client Settings > Call Settings .
2
In App Call Options Priority, you can drag calling options between Available Call Options and Hidden Call Options, to show or hide calling options for users.
You can rearrange the options in the Available Call Options in the priority order as needed for users in your organization.

  Hidden call options do not appear in users' contact cards in Webex App.
The number 1 priority call option you choose is used for the single click-to-call feature. If the number 1 priority chosen hasn't been set up, the call automatically reroutes to the next option. For example, if you choose Work Number as the first available call option, when your users make a call from Webex App, the call is always routed to a person's work number. If that person doesn't have a work number, the call is automatically routed to the next available option, such as their SIP URI.
If Unified CM phone service is the highest priority call setting and the phone services disconnect, the system doesn't try the next available calling option.
3
Toggle on Enable Single Click-to-Call if you want users to be able to make a call with the first call option that you configured.

  Your changes are automatically saved.

  The changes may take up to 24 hours to appear in Webex App. You can advise your users to restart their apps to pick up on these changes more quickly.
