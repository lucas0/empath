Webex App | Prevent attendees from starting Slido during a meeting
As a meeting host or cohost, you can limit who can start Slido (polling and Q&A) during a meeting. If you only want the host, the cohosts, and the presenter to be able to start Slido, turn it off for attendees.
Use Slido to create polls and live Q&A sessions.
This feature is available on our Video Mesh-ready meeting platform. Find out if your meetings use the Video Mesh-ready meeting platform.

  This feature isn't supported for Webex for Government.
