Frames
Using the camera mode Frames gives everyone a better view.
Choosing the camera mode Frames enhances the view sent from your meeting room. Frames mode crops away uneccessary space around participants and composes a view where the people appear closer together, evenly sized and at the same eye level, in up to four frames. People who are sitting close together will be grouped in frames to keep the feeling of continuity in the room.
You can read this article for information about other automatic camera modes.
To enable Frames:
Open the Control Panel on your Board or Touch controller. Tap Camera.
Under Camera mode, select Frames.
If there are more than four people in the room they'll be grouped into frames, or switched to a Group view that shows everyone present.
