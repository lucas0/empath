Webex App | Edit Messages
Don't worry if you misspell or mistype a word, or if you need to change what you've said. You can edit the text of your messages after you've sent them to make sure they're just right.
If you're using Webex App for web, you won't be able to edit messages, but you can see when messages have been edited.
You can edit messages with attachments, except for messages that have audio file attachments.
Desktop
Mobile
Web
Hover over your message and click Edit message. Then, make your changes and click Update.
After you update the message, you'll see (Edited) next to it in the space. You can only edit a message 10 times.

  You can use the shift + up arrow shortcut to edit the last message you sent in a space.
