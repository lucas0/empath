Webex App | Quietly leave a space
You can leave a space if you don't need to be in it anymore. When you leave, other space members don't receive a notification that you've left.
When you leave a moderated space, only the moderator of the space receives a notification that you've left.
If you remove someone from a space, only you receive a notification of the removal.
Other space members don't know when you've left a moderated or unmoderated space, maintaining your privacy and anonymity.
For moderators
If you're the last moderator of a team space, the option to Leave the space is disabled. You must first either unmoderate the space or promote someone else to moderate it.

In the space, click Space Information and select Leave.

  You can also right-click the space in your spaces list and then select Leave.
