Webex App | Send announcements in moderated spaces
Sometimes you need to share important information with your team, without the distraction from other conversations happening in the space. With Webex App, you can use announcement mode in any moderated space just for announcements.
When you turn on announcements for a space, the other people in the space get notified about the change.
When you make an announcement space, only moderators, bots, and integrations can post to it. Everyone else can just read the announcements, view files, and join meetings. System messages that show when people join or leave a space or delete messages still display too.

In the space where you're a moderator, go to Space Information, and then select Turn on announcement mode. You and the other moderators in the space see the announcement icon in the message area. Other people in the space won't see that icon.
