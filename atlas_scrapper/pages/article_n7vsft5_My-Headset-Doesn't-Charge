My Headset Doesn't Charge
Try these steps if your Cisco Headset 730 battery doesn't charge.
Make sure the USB-C cable is connected to the USB-C port on your headset. The Power LED beneath the Power/Bluetooth switch lights up when the headset charges.
See Charge Your Cisco Headset 730 with the USB-C Cable.
Make sure that both ends of the USB cable are secure.
If the headset has been exposed to extreme high or low temperatures, let the headset return to room temperature before you try to charge the headset.
Try a different USB-A wall charger or AC power source.
