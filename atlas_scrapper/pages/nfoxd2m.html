As a full administrator, read-only administrator, or support administrator of an organization, you have access to various charts in Control Hub, depending on your deployment. You can use this information to evaluate how Webex services and devices are being used in your organization and how often. For example, you can use analytics to track and measure services in your cloud collaboration portfolio.

  These analytics data are for your general use and shouldn't be used for billing purposes.
If you've linked your Site Administration account to Control Hub, then you can access the Analytics page through Site Administration.
Historical charts are standard in Control Hub. Most charts are available in daily, weekly, and monthly format. The amount of data you have access to depends on the type of customer you are. If you're a standard customer, you have access to 3 months of data. If you're a Pro Pack customer, you have access to 13 months of data.

  Apart from Video Mesh, all reports are in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
Analytics data, except for Meetings, is batch processed each day. Data is made available within 24 hours and metrics are available by 1:00PM GMT the next day. Meetings data is updated every 10 minutes.
