Schedule, manage, and start a meeting for another host in Microsoft Outlook
If you have a host account, you can schedule meetings for another host using the Webex Scheduler or Webex Productivity Tools in Microsoft Outlook. If you manage the calendar of someone else or the actual host can't schedule a meeting, you can access their Outlook calendar if they grant you permission.

Before you can schedule meetings on behalf of someone else, do the following:

Make sure that you sign in to your own Webex account in Webex Scheduler or Webex Productivity Tools.
