Manage Cisco Devices Logs from Control Hub
Download and manage logs from Control Hub to troubleshoot and manage devices in your organization.
Generating logs is available for those with full admin access. Read-only admins can get access, when Automatic Crash Reporting has been enabled for the organization. This can be enabled from the Settings page.
You can’t generate logs from a device that’s offline. You can download any previously generated logs even when the device is offline.
The logs don’t include PII.
Webex Edge for Devices linked devices need to be running CE9.14.3 or later. To generate logs from Control Hub from these devices, you need enable it on the device first. Set the configuration Logging CloudUpload Mode to On.
