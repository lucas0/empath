Cisco Headset 720 Series product safety and security
Safety and Performance Information
Important Headset Safety Information
High Sound Pressure—Avoid listening to high volume levels for long periods to prevent possible hearing damage.
When you plug in your headset, lower the volume of the headset speaker before you put the headset on. If you remember to lower the volume before you take the headset off, the volume will start lower when you plug in your headset again.
Don't allow moisture to get inside your ear cups, the USB-C port, or the 3.5 mm jack.
Be aware of your surroundings. When you use your headset, it may block out important external sounds, particularly in emergencies or in noisy environments. Don’t use the headset while driving. Don’t leave your headset or headset cables in an area where people or pets can trip over them. Always supervise children who are near your headset or headset cables.
Regulatory Domains
The radio frequency (RF) for this phone is configured for a specific regulatory domain. If you use this phone outside of the specific regulatory domain, the phone will not function properly, and you might violate local regulations.
External Devices
We recommend that you use good-quality external devices that are shielded against unwanted radio frequency (RF) and audio frequency (AF) signals. External devices include headsets, cables, and connectors.
Depending on the quality of these devices and their proximity to other devices, such as mobile phones or two-way radios, some audio noise may still occur. In these cases, we recommend that you take one or more of these actions:
Move the external device away from the source of the RF or AF signals.
Route the external device cables away from the source of the RF or AF signals.
Use shielded cables for the external device, or use cables with a better shield and connector.
Shorten the length of the external device cable.
Apply ferrites or other such devices on the cables for the external device.
Cisco cannot guarantee the performance of external devices, cables, and connectors.

  In European Union countries, use only external speakers, microphones, and headsets that are fully compliant with the EMC Directive [89/336/EC].
Bluetooth Wireless Headset Performance
Cisco IP Phones support Bluetooth Class 2 technology when the headsets support Bluetooth. Bluetooth enables low-bandwidth wireless connections within a range of 30 feet (10 meters). The best performance is in the 3- to 6-foot (1- to 2-meter) range. You can connect up to five headsets, but only the last one connected is used as the default.
Because of potential interference issues, we recommend that you move 802.11b/g devices, Bluetooth devices, microwave ovens, and large metal objects away from the wireless headset.
The Bluetooth wireless headset does not need to be within direct line-of-sight of the phone. However, some barriers, such as walls or doors, and interference from other electronic devices, can affect the connection.
UL Warning
The LAN/Ethernet cable or other cables attached to the device should not be extended outside of the building.
Product Label
The product label is located on the bottom of the device.
