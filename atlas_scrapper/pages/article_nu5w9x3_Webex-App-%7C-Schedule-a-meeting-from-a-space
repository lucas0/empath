Webex App | Schedule a meeting from a space
Schedule a meeting with everyone in your space at a specified date and time, whether it's a space with one or more people. Send calendar invites to everyone in the space to tell them about the meeting and how to join. You can also make sure that your meetings are end-to-end encrypted.
To schedule an enhanced meeting associated with a space, you must have a license and be part of the same organization as the person who created the space.
The number of people who can join your meeting can vary, depending on whether it's a classic or enhanced meeting associated with a space.
For classic meetings, it depends on the the account type of the person who created the space. For more information, see Meeting Capabilities and Meeting Sponsors in Cisco Webex.
For enhanced meetings, it depends on the type of account you have, as the host.
End-to-end encryption for Webex App meetings
Meetings associated with a space support end-to-end encryption. For more information on how to encrypt all your meetings by default, see Webex App | Set end-to-end encryption for meetings.

Choose the scheduler that you want to use to schedule meetings. You can schedule meetings from a space using Microsoft Outlook, Google Calendar, or the Webex App scheduler (if your administrator has set up your account with Cisco Webex Hybrid Calendar Service).
If your administrator hasn't set up your account with Hybrid Calendar or you're using a calendar other than Microsoft Outlook or Google Calendar, use the instructions in Other Calendars.
