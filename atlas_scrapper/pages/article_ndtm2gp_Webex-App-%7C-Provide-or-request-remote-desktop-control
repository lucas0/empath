Webex App | Provide or request remote desktop control
When you're sharing your screen during a call or meeting, or in a space, you can give someone else mouse and keyboard access to your screen. You can also request access to someone else's screen when they're sharing. This can help if you need to troubleshoot an issue or if you're in a training session with someone.
If you're in a call and don't see the option to Give control or Request control, it could mean you're not set up with Webex Calling or you're not in a Call on Webex. If you're not sure what calling service you have, see Webex App | Find Out What Calling Service You Have.
In meetings, this feature is available on our Video Mesh-ready meeting platform. Find out if your meetings use the Video Mesh-ready meeting platform.
