Webex Meetings in devices
Anyone can start an instant Webex meeting on a Cisco cloud-registered video device. You no longer need to have your laptop or tablet to start an instant meeting. Simply walk into a room with a Cisco device, tap the Webex button, and start your meeting.
Sharing the meeting join information is so easy. Scan the QR code displayed on the screen, copy the join information, and paste it into your app of choice. Or, invite participants directly from the directory. Invitees can be from inside or outside of your organization.
What you need:
Board, Desk, or Room Series video devices registered to the cloud
Or devices configured in Edge for Devices mode with Webex Optimized Join enabled
RoomOS 11 or later
You can Start an Instant Meeting on Board, Room, and Desk Devices.
To use Webex Meetings in devices, Webex administrators need to:
Add the shared device to a workspace in Control Hub
If your organization doesn't have a Webex site, add a site in Control Hub.
Specify the Webex site to use for meetings.
Webex Meetings in devices are enabled, by default.
