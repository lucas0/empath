Webex App | See people's availability
You can see other people's availability in Webex App. If you need to contact someone, check to see if they're actively using the app. This makes it easy to know if others are available to respond to messages.
When people are using their computer, their availability displays as active in Webex App on Windows or Mac. When they're away from their computer, Webex App shows when they were last active.
When people send or read new messages in the app, their availability displays as active in Webex App on iPhone, iPad, or Android. When they're away from the app, Webex App shows when they were last active.
You can only see the availability of people in your organization. You can see someone's availability information whenever you see their profile picture: when you send them messages, see them in a space, or search for them.
Webex App on Desktop, Mobile, and Web
The following is the availability information that you see on the profile picture on Webex App for desktop, mobile, and web, in the order of precedence in which availability states appear.
For example, In a Meeting takes precedence over Active.
Airplane—The out of office reply is set in Microsoft Outlook.
Red icon—Do not disturb.
Arrow—Sharing a screen or application.
Meeting—In a meeting.
Call—On a call.
Green icon—Active in the last 10 minutes.
Clock—Not active.

  Webex App suppresses notifications for incoming messages or calls when people are sharing their screen or application while on a call or on a meeting.
