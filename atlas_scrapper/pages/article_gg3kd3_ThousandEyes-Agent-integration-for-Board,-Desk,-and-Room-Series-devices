ThousandEyes Agent integration for Board, Desk, and Room Series devices
Enable ThousandEyes Agent on Cisco collaboration devices to get hop-by-hop network path visibility when these devices are part of meetings.
Collaboration devices use the Control Hub integration that is also used for Webex apps. ThousandEyes Agent is already part of the RoomOS software, but you need to enable it on selected or all devices in Control Hub.
Initially the integration for collaboration devices supports Webex meetings.
