Integrated Audio for Webex Calling
With Webex Calling, when using call-in numbers for Webex Meetings, these calls stay in the Webex cloud, which means there is no additional PSTN cost to call in to Webex Meetings from Webex Calling endpoints.
Meeting attendees may wish to call in if they’re having bandwidth issues or if they’re out and about and would prefer to join using audio only.
Integrated audio for call-in calls is enabled, by default. You can disable this setting for your organization in Control Hub, if needed.
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Services.
2
Select Calling > Service Settings.
3
Scroll down to Call Routing for Webex Meetings Dial-in calls and choose one of the following:
Optimized On-net—This is the default and recommended option to achieve PSTN cost savings and optimized call routing.
PSTN (not recommended)—This option disables on-net routing optimized for Webex Meetings for call-in calls.
4
Click Save.
