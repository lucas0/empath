Manage Content Sharing Security on Your Webex Site
In this article
Site administrators can choose whether to allow presenters to automatically accept requests for keyboard and mouse control. Site administrators can also choose whether to allow screen captures of the Webex app on Android devices.

Control Hub
1
Sign in to Webex Site Administration and go to Configuration > Common Site Settings > Options.

Scroll down to Site Options > Webex Meetings Content Sharing Security and configure the following options:
Check or uncheck Allow screen capture (Android devices only).

  This feature applies only to Webex; users can still take screen captures while multitasking outside of the Webex app.
Check or uncheck Allow users to automatically accept all requests for keyboard and mouse control.
When the option is unchecked, the presenter has to manually pass control to another participant.
