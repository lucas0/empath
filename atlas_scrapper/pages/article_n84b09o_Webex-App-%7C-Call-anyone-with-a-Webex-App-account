Webex App | Call anyone with a Webex App account
You can call anyone who has a Webex App account, whether they're in the same organization as you or not. These are special types of calls that let you add guests to the call, share your whiteboard, and share your screens. You don't need to use their phone number; you just need to be connected to them in the app.

You can make a call from many different places in Webex App. Just look for the Audio or Video call icons whenever you're sending a direct message, looking at a contact card, or entering a name or email address into the Search bar.
If you're set up with a phone service such as Unified CM, Webex Calling, or Calling hosted by a Service Provider, you also have access to a dial pad and can make a call from there. Just click and enter a person's name, email address, or video address (such as for a room device) in the dial pad.

Choose whether you want to make it an Audio or Video call and then choose Call on Webex.

  If you have multiple phone lines (Unified CM only), you can change the active line for calling.

  If your administrator has enabled call security for your organization, you'll see at the top right of your calling window, letting you know that the call is secure.
