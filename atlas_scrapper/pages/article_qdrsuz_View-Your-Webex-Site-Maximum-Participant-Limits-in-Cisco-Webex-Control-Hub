View Your Webex Site Maximum Participant Limits in Cisco Webex Control Hub
Site administrators can view participant limits for each service on Webex sites that are managed through Control Hub. For Webex Webinars, the maximum number of participants allowed is not limited and depends on the site's capacity. However, the maximum number of participants for hosts, co-hosts, and panelists is limited to 500.
For Webex video platform version 1.0 users, an extra 25 participants are allowed past the stated participant limit. For video platform version 2.0 users, the participant limit does not exceed what is stated.
