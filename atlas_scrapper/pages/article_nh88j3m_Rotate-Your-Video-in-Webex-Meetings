Rotate Your Video in Webex Meetings
When using a Windows convertible laptop, your video can display upside down or sideways to your meeting attendees when you switch the deviceâ€™s orientation. You can rotate the camera during the meeting from your video settings so that the video displays correctly.
1
Click Video Options in the control bar and select Settings.
2
Click Rotate in the video preview until the video orientation displays correctly.

  If you're using a virtual background, it will not display upside down or sideways. Rotating the video display does not rotate the virtual background.
3
Click Apply.
