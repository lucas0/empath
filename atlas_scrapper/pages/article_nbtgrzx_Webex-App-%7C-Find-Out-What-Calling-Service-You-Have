Webex App | Find Out What Calling Service You Have
If your administrator has set up phone services for your organization, you have some advanced calling features that you can use in Webex App. If you're not sure what service you have, there's an easy way to tell.
Windows
Mac
Mobile
Click your profile picture and then go to Settings > Phone Services.
You'll see one of the following services here:
You're signed in to Cisco Unified Communications Manager—Your calling service is Unified CM.
You're signed in to Webex Calling—Your calling service is Webex Calling.
You're signed in—Your calling service is hosted by your Service Provider.

  If you don't see a Phone Services setting, that means your organization is configured for Webex App calls only.
For information about what features are available to you, see Webex | Supported Calling Options
