Implement CUBE High Availability as Local Gateway
In this article
Local Gateway (LGW) is the only option to provide premises-based PSTN access for Cisco Webex Calling customers. The objective of this document is to assist you in building a Local Gateway configuration using CUBE high availability, active/standby CUBEs for stateful failover of active calls.
Fundamentals
Prerequisites
Before you deploy CUBE HA as a local gateway for Webex Calling, make sure you have an in-depth understanding of the following concepts:
Cisco Webex Calling solution
Local Gateway option for Cisco Webex Calling
Layer 2 box-to-box redundancy with CUBE Enterprise for stateful call preservation
The configuration guidelines provided in this article assume a dedicated local gateway platform with no existing voice configuration. If an existing CUBE enterprise deployment is being modified to also utilize the local gateway function for Cisco Webex Calling, pay close attention to the configuration applied to ensure existing call flows and functionalities are not interrupted and make sure you're adhering to CUBE HA design requirements.
Hardware and Software Components
CUBE HA as local gateway requires IOS-XE version 16.12.2 or later and a platform on which both CUBE HA and LGW functions are supported.

The show commands and logs in this article are based on minimum software release of Cisco IOS-XE 16.12.2 implemented on a vCUBE (CSR1000v).
Reference Material
Here are some detailed CUBE HA configuration guides for various platforms:

Webex Calling Solution Overview
Cisco Webex Calling is a collaboration offering that provides a multi-tenant cloud-based alternative to on-premise PBX phone service with multiple PSTN options for customers.
The Local Gateway deployment (represented below) is the focus of this article. Local gateway (Premises-based PSTN) trunk in Webex Calling allows connectivity to a customer-owned PSTN service. It also provides connectivity to an on-premises IP PBX deployment such as Cisco Unified CM. All communication to and from the cloud is secured using TLS transport for SIP and SRTP for media.
The figure below displays a Webex Calling deployment without any existing IP PBX and is applicable to a single or a multi-site deployment. Configuration outlined in this article is based on this deployment.
Layer 2 Box-to-Box Redundancy
CUBE HA layer 2 box-to-box redundancy uses the Redundancy Group (RG) infrastructure protocol to form an active/standby pair of routers. This pair share the same virtual IP address (VIP) across their respective interfaces and continually exchange status messages. CUBE session information is check-pointed across the pair of routers enabling the standby router to take all CUBE call processing responsibilities over immediately if the active router goes out of service, resulting in stateful preservation of signaling and media.

Check pointing is limited to connected calls with media packets. Calls in transit are not check pointed (for example, a trying or ringing state).
In this article, CUBE HA will refer to CUBE High Availability (HA) Layer 2 Box-to-box (B2B) redundancy for stateful call preservation
As of IOS-XE 16.12.2, CUBE HA can be deployed as a Local Gateway for Cisco Webex Calling trunk (Premises-based PSTN) deployments and we’ll cover design considerations and configurations in this article. This figure displays a typical CUBE HA setup as Local Gateway for a Cisco Webex Calling trunk deployment.
Redundancy Group Infra Component
The Redundancy Group (RG) Infra component provides the box-to-box communication infrastructure support between the two CUBEs and negotiates the final stable redundancy state. This component also provides:
An HSRP-like protocol that negotiates the final redundancy state for each router by exchanging keepalive and hello messages between the two CUBEs (via the control interface)—GigabitEthernet3 in the figure above.
A transport mechanism for checkpointing the signaling and media state for each call from the active to the standby router (via the data interface)—GigabitEthernet3 in the figure above.
Configuration and management of the Virtual IP (VIP) interface for the traffic interfaces (multiple traffic interfaces can be configured using the same RG group) – GigabitEthernet 1 and 2 are considered traffic interfaces.
This RG component has to be specifically configured to support voice B2B HA.
Virtual IP (VIP) Address Management for Both Signaling and Media
B2B HA relies on VIP to achieve redundancy. The VIP and associated physical interfaces on both CUBEs in the CUBE HA pair must reside on the same LAN subnet. Configuration of the VIP and binding of the VIP interface to a particular voice application (SIP) are mandatory for voice B2B HA support. External devices such as Unified CM, Webex Calling access SBC, service provider, or proxy, use VIP as the destination IP address for the calls traversing through the CUBE HA routers. Hence, from a Webex Calling point of view, the CUBE HA pairs acts as a single local gateway.
The call signaling and RTP session information of established calls are checkpointed from the active router to the standby router. When the Active router goes down, the Standby router takes over, and continues to forward the RTP stream that was previously routed by the first router.
Calls in a transient state at the time of failover will not be preserved post-switchover. For example, calls that aren't fully established yet or are in the process of being modified with a transfer or hold function. Established calls may be disconnected post-switchover.
The following requirements exist for using CUBE HA as a local gateway for stateful failover of calls:
CUBE HA cannot have TDM or analog interfaces co-located
Gig1 and Gig2 are referred to as traffic (SIP/RTP) interfaces and Gig3 is Redundancy Group (RG) Control/data interface
No more than 2 CUBE HA pairs can be placed in the same layer 2 domain, one with group id 1 and the other with group id 2. If configuring 2 HA pairs with the same group id, RG Control/Data interfaces needs to belong to different layer 2 domains (vlan, separate switch)
Port channel is supported for both RG Control/data and traffic interfaces
All signaling/media is sourced from/to the Virtual IP Address
Anytime a platform is reloaded in a CUBE-HA relationship, it always boots up as Standby
Lower address for all the interfaces (Gig1, Gig2, Gig3) should be on the same platform
Redundancy Interface Identifier, rii should be unique to a pair/interface combination on the same Layer 2
Configuration on both the CUBEs must be identical including physical configuration and must be running on the same type of platform and IOS-XE version
Loopback interfaces cannot be used as bind as they are always up
Multiple traffic (SIP/RTP) interfaces (Gig1, Gig2) require interface tracking to be configured
CUBE-HA is not supported over a crossover cable connection for the RG-control/data link (Gig3)
Both platforms must be identical and be connected via a physical Switch across all likewise interfaces for CUBE HA to work, i.e. GE0/0/0 of CUBE-1 and CUBE-2 must terminate on the same switch and so on.
Cannot have WAN terminated on CUBEs directly or Data HA on either side
Both Active/Standby must be in the same data center
It is mandatory to use separate L3 interface for redundancy (RG Control/data, Gig3). i.e interface used for traffic cannot be used for HA keepalives and checkpointing
Upon failover, the previously active CUBE goes through a reload by design, preserving signaling and media
Configure Redundancy on Both CUBEs
You must configure layer 2 box-to-box redundancy on both CUBEs intended to be used in an HA pair to bring up virtual IPs.
1
Configure interface tracking at a global level to track the status of the interface.
conf t
 track 1 interface GigabitEthernet1 line-protocol
 track 2 interface GigabitEthernet2 line-protocol
 exit
VCUBE-1#conf t
VCUBE-1(config)#track 1 interface GigabitEthernet1 line-protocol
VCUBE-1(config-track)#track 2 interface GigabitEthernet2 line-protocol
VCUBE-1(config-track)#exit
VCUBE-2#conf t
VCUBE-2(config)#track 1 interface GigabitEthernet1 line-protocol
VCUBE-2(config-track)#track 2 interface GigabitEthernet2 line-protocol
VCUBE-2(config-track)#exit
Track CLI is used in RG to track the voice traffic interface state so that the active route will quite its active role after the traffic interface is down.
2
Configure an RG for use with VoIP HA under the application redundancy sub-mode.

VCUBE-2(config)#
Here's an explanation of the fields used in this configuration:
redundancy—Enters redundancy mode
application redundancy—Enters application redundancy configuration mode
group—Enters redundancy application group configuration mode
name LocalGateway-HA—Defines the name of the RG group
priority 100 failover threshold 75—Specifies the initial priority and failover thresholds for an RG
timers delay 30 reload 60—Configures the two times for delay and reload
Delay timer which is the amount of time to delay RG group’s initialization and role negotiation after the interface comes up – Default 30 seconds. Range is 0-10000 seconds
Reload—This is the amount of time to delay RG group initialization and role-negotiation after a reload – Default 60 seconds. Range is 0-10000 seconds
Default timers are recommended, though these timers may be adjusted to accommodate any additional network convergence delay that may occur during bootup/reload of the routers, in order to guarantee that the RG protocol negotiation takes place after routing in the network has converged to a stable point. For example, if it is seen after failover that it takes up to 20 sec for the new STANDBY to see the first RG HELLO packet from the new ACTIVE, then the timers should be adjusted to ‘timers delay 60 reload 120’ to factor in this delay.
control GigabitEthernet3 protocol 1—Configures the interface used to exchange keepalive and hello messages between the two CUBEs, and specifies the protocol instance that will be attached to a control interface and enters redundancy application protocol configuration mode
data GigabitEthernet3—Configures the interface used for checkpointing of data traffic
track—RG group tracking of interfaces
protocol 1—Specifies the protocol instance that will be attached to a control interface and enters redundancy application protocol configuration mode
timers hellotime 3 holdtime 10—Configures the two timers for hellotime and holdtime:
Hellotime— Interval between successive hello messages – Default 3 seconds. Range is 250 milliseconds-254 seconds
Holdtime—The interval between the receipt of a Hello message and the presumption that the sending router has failed. This duration has to be greater than the hello-time – Default 10 seconds. Range is 750 milliseconds-255 seconds
We recommend that you configure the holdtime timer to be at least 3 times the value of the hellotime timer.
3
Enable box-to-box redundancy for the CUBE application. Configure the RG from the previous step under voice service voip. This enables the CUBE application to control the redundancy process.
voice service voip
   redundancy-group 1
   exit
VCUBE-1(config)#voice service voip
VCUBE-1(config-voi-serv)#redundancy-group 1
% Created RG 1 association with Voice B2B HA; reload the router for the new configuration to take effect
VCUBE-1(config-voi-serv)# exit
VCUBE-2(config)#voice service voip
VCUBE-2(config-voi-serv)#redundancy-group 1
% Created RG 1 association with Voice B2B HA; reload the router for the new configuration to take effect
VCUBE-2(config-voi-serv)# exit
redundancy-group 1—Adding and removing this command requires a reload for the updated configuration to take effect. We'll reload the platforms after all the configuration has been applied.
4
Configure the Gig1 and Gig2 interfaces with their respective virtual IPs as shown below and apply the redundancy interface identifier (rii)
VCUBE-1(config)#interface GigabitEthernet1
VCUBE-1(config-if)# redundancy rii 1
VCUBE-1(config-if)# redundancy group 1 ip 198.18.1.228 exclusive
VCUBE-1(config-if)# exit
VCUBE-1(config)#
VCUBE-1(config)#interface GigabitEthernet2
VCUBE-1(config-if)# redundancy rii 2
VCUBE-1(config-if)# redundancy group 1 ip 198.18.133.228 exclusive
VCUBE-1(config-if)# exit
VCUBE-2(config)#interface GigabitEthernet1
VCUBE-2(config-if)# redundancy rii 1
VCUBE-2(config-if)# redundancy group 1 ip 198.18.1.228 exclusive
VCUBE-2(config-if)# exit
VCUBE-2(config)#
VCUBE-2(config)#interface GigabitEthernet2
VCUBE-2(config-if)# redundancy rii 2
VCUBE-2(config-if)# redundancy group 1 ip 198.18.133.228 exclusive
VCUBE-v(config-if)# exit
Here's an explanation of the fields used in this configuration:
redundancy rii—Configures the redundancy interface identifier for the redundancy group. Required for generating a Virtual MAC (VMAC) address. The same rii ID value must be used on the interface of each router (ACTIVE/STANDBY) that has the same VIP.

  If there is more than one B2B pair on the same LAN, each pair MUST have unique rii IDs on their respective interfaces (to prevent collision). ‘show redundancy application group all’ should indicate the correct local and peer information.
redundancy group 1—Associates the interface with the redundancy group created in Step 2 above. Configure the RG group, as well as the VIP assigned to this physical interface.

  It is mandatory to use a separate interface for redundancy, that is, the interface used for voice traffic cannot be used as control and data interface specified in Step 2 above. In this example, Gigabit interface 3 is used for RG control/data
5
Save the configuration of the first CUBE and reload it.
The platform to reload last is always the Standby.
VCUBE-1#wr
Building configuration...
[OK]
VCUBE-1#reload
Proceed with reload? [confirm]
After VCUBE-1 boots up completely, save the configuration of VCUBE-2 and reload it.
VCUBE-2#wr
Building configuration...
[OK]
VCUBE-2#reload
Proceed with reload? [confirm]
6
Verify that the box-to-box configuration is working as expected. Relevant output is highlighted in bold.
We reloaded VCUBE-2 last and as per the design considerations; the platform to reload last will always be Standby.

From the output above, you can see that VCUBE-2 is the active LGW maintaining the registration with Webex Calling access SBC, whereas the output of the “show sip-ua register status” is blank in VCUBE-1
3
Now enable the following debugs on VCUBE-1
VCUBE-1#debug ccsip non-call
SIP Out-of-Dialog tracing is enabled
VCUBE-1#debug ccsip info
SIP Call info tracing is enabled
VCUBE-1#debug ccsip message
4
Simulate failover by issuing the following command on the active LGW, VCUBE-2 in this case.
VCUBE-2#redundancy application reload group 1 self
Switchover from the ACTIVE to the STANDBY LGW occurs in the following scenario as well besides the CLI listed above
When the ACTIVE router reloads
When the ACTIVE router power cycles
When any RG configured interface of the ACTIVE router is shutdown for which tracking is enabled
5
Check to see if VCUBE-1 has registered with Webex Calling access SBC. VCUBE-2 would have reloaded by now.

VCUBE-1 is now the active LGW.

Look at the relevant debug log on VCUBE-1 sending a SIP REGISTER to Webex Calling VIA the virtual IP and receiving a 200 OK.
