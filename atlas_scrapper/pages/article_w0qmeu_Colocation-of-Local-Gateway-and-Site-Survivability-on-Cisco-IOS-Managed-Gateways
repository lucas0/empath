Colocation of Local Gateway and Site Survivability on Cisco IOS Managed Gateways
In this article
As an administrator, use this article to know about the colocation of Local Gateway and Survivability Gateway services on Cisco IOS Managed Gateways.
Overview

This section is a draft that’s in public preview. We’re giving you a sneak peek at what to expect. To see the new Calling feature, you can sign up for the beta program at https://gobeta.webex.com.
Webex Calling supports the colocation of a Survivability Gateway with a Local Gateway on the same Cisco IOS managed gateway. That is, you can use the same Cisco IOS gateway device to configure Local Gateway and Survivability Gateway services. Hence, you don’t need to have two different Cisco IOS managed gateways assigned as the Survivability Gateway and Local Gateway.

This article discusses the considerations for the colocation of Local Gateway and Survivability Gateway services in comparison to the standalone deployment of these services.
For information on standalone Local Gateway services, see Configure Local Gateway on Cisco IOS XE for Webex Calling and Enroll Cisco IOS managed gateways to Webex Cloud.
For information on standalone Survivability Gateway services, see Site survivability for Webex Calling.

The total number of registrations supported by a platform is the sum of phone and trunk registrations. Also, concurrent line and trunk registrations aren’t anticipated. Hence, the scale numbers of either Survivability Gateway or Local Gateway aren’t impacted by colocation of these functions on a single device.
Prerequisites
Cisco IOS XE Dublin 17.12.1a
Limitations and restrictions
The following are the known limitations for colocation of services in Cisco IOS managed gateways:
High Availability isn’t supported for Local Gateways.
Config validation isn’t supported for Local Gateways.
In Control Hub, the gateway must be provisioned as a Survivability Gateway service.
If the customer has provisioned the gateway as a Local Gateway, they need to unassign, and then reassign the service as Survivability Gateway.
Colocation is specific to Cisco IOS Gateway. Customers using third-party Local Gateway must deploy Survivability Gateway separately.
Colocation for partner-deployed Local Gateway shared across multiple customers isn’t applicable.
For limitations and restrictions specific to the standalone gateway services, see Enroll Cisco IOS managed gateways to Webex Cloud and Site survivability for Webex Calling.
Call routing considerations for colocation
Call routing for colocation is based on a routing strategy that involves a combination of dial peer groups (DPG) and regular routing based on destination patterns. This is different from the call routing strategies used for standalone Cisco IOS managed gateway services. A standalone Local Gateway service uses a DPG-based call routing strategy. Standalone Survivability Gateway routes call using destination patterns.
Figure 1. Call Routing for Colocation of Local Gateway and Site Survivability Services
Consider the following when configuring call routing for colocation scenarios.
For calls from Webex Calling—The inbound dial-peer from Webex Calling is matched based on the Local Gateway hostname or DTG parameter in the URI. The inbound dial-peer is tied to a DPG having PSTN. The call is then routed to PSTN. In short, there’s no change in call routing from the existing Local Gateway routing strategy.
For calls from PSTN—Remove the call routing based on dial-peer groups. Route the calls using regular destination-pattern based routing. That is, an inbound dial-peer isn’t tied to a DPG in this strategy. Inbound dial-peer from PSTN is matched based on PSTN IP address in Via URI. Regular dial-peer look up would be done and a call would be routed based on dial-peer preference. The call is routed to a locally registered endpoint for survivability mode or to Webex Calling for active mode.
For calls from locally registered endpoints (applicable for site survivability mode during WAN outages)—Route the calls using regular destination-pattern based routing. In this strategy, an inbound dial-peer is matched to a line side dial-peer. Regular dial-peer look up is performed and a call would be routed based on dial-peer preference. The call is routed to a locally registered endpoint, PSTN, or Webex Calling.
A preference can be defined for each outbound dial-peer. This preference is used to decide the order of selection of dial-peers for the setup of an outgoing call. Lower the value, higher is the preference. For call routing in colocation, the dial-peer preference is set as follows:
Default preference of 0 to route calls to locally registered endpoints
Preference of 2 to route calls to Webex Calling trunk
Preference of 3 to route calls to PSTN trunk
The following table summarizes the call routing behavior for all inbound and outbound calls in Webex Calling that involves colocation of Cisco IOS managed gateway services:

Configure colocation of services
If you need to assign a new Cisco IOS managed gateway for the colocation of Local Gateway and site survivability services, assign your gateway as a Survivability Gateway on the Control Hub. For information on assigning the Gateway as a Survivability Gateway, see Enroll Cisco IOS Managed Gateways to Webex Cloud to add the gateway to Control Hub.
Depending on the type of trunking that is used, you can configure colocation using one of the following:
Configure colocation for registration-based trunking
Configure colocation for certificate-based trunking
