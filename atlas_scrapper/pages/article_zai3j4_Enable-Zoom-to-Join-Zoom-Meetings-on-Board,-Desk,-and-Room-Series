Enable Zoom to Join Zoom Meetings on Board, Desk, and Room Series
By enabling Zoom in Control Hub, participants invited to a Zoom meeting can join the meeting directly from their devices with One Button to Push (OBTP) or by selecting the Zoom button.
In order to join a Zoom meeting directly with OBTP, you need to turn on the hybrid calendar.
If your device is linked to Webex Edge for devices, you need to enable Allow Control Hub to manage configurations.

All call controls specific to Zoom meetings are available in the meeting when your device is connected to a Touch Controller. On Board and Desk series, the call controls are the same as for regular calls.
