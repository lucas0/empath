Highlighted features for this update
Simultaneous Interpretation
Hosts invite interpreters and assign them to the appropriate language channel as needed. Hosts can create audio channels at the beginning of the meeting.
Multiple language channels can be created and when participants join, they can select the appropriate audio channel. As soon as they join, they can hear their selected language.
This solution supports meetings and large events (webinars), multiple interpreters per channel, relay interpretation, and bi-directional interpretation.

  The Manage interpreters feature is currently unavailable and will come in a later update.
Simultaneous Interpretation is available in Webex Meeting desktop app, Webex Events (new), Web app, and Mobile.

For more information, see Customize what attendees see when they join a webinar and Customize what attendees see in your webcasts.
Accessibility settings: Manage screen reader notifications and chat font size
In this update, we've added a new item under the Help > Accessibility Settings Here, a user can:
Manage their screen reader notifications announcements—For users who use assistive screen reader applications (like JAWS and VoiceOver), it may become overwhelming if the screen reader is announcing every single notification in a meeting. For example, if people are constantly coming in and out of the meeting, this may distract from being able to hear the conversation in the meeting. Now, users can manage which notifications they would like their screenreader to announce.
Adjust the font size in the Chat panel—You can now increase the size of the font in the Chat panel, directly from the meeting. Particularly useful if you don’t want to adjust your font or display settings at the system level.
For more information, see Webex Meetings and Webex Events accessibility features.
Pre-Meeting experience
Stream your Webex Meetings or Webex Events to Vbrick available for Webex for Government
As a host, you can stream your Webex meetings or events to Vbrick Rev. This allows you to connect with your audiences by easily sharing your video and content with Webex controls.

You can choose to view individual registration by clicking on the registrant’s name and export reports to a CSV formatted file that is available for both reports.
For more information, see Generate attendance and registration reports for Webex Meetings and Webex Events.
Media enhancements
Edge callback GDM
In the continuous effort of improving our customers' meeting experience, we’ve enabled a new Edge Audio feature Callback GDM (Global Distributed Media) for all Webex Edge Audio customers. Your branch offices across the globe will now receive Edge callback from your closest Cisco Data Center, and we’ll carry your cross continent on-net traffic through Cisco Network Backbone instead of the Internet—thus improving voice quality and stability.
For example, you have a Webex site in the United States that has a branch office in Japan. Earlier users from the Japan office would receive an Edge callback from the United States Data Center through the Internet. When the Japanese user speaks, their audio is transferred to United States for audio mixing, and again through the Internet. Once this feature is enabled, the user receives the Edge callback from our Asia-Pacific Data Center - which is much closer. Moreover, their audio pockets will only need to reach Cisco Asia-Pacific Data Center through Internet, and then the majority of cross continent distance between Asia-Pacific Data Center and United States Data Center is be covered through Cisco’s Network Backbone.
Device enhancements
Webex devices in breakout sessions
In the 41.9 update, we announced limited availability, now in 41.10 Breakout session support for Webex Devices is generally available to all customers.
Hosts can move devices to a breakout session to have a more inclusive experience with other users. Users on devices will see appropriate prompts as they get assigned and moved to breakout sessions.
Requirements
Webex Devices with Room OS 10 software.
Known Limitations:
Support for breakout sessions is only available on Webex Cloud Connected Devices and Webex Edge Devices configured for Webex Optimized Join mode.
Older devices such as DX, SX, and MX series can't be moved into a breakout session and stays in the main session.
Pre-assignment of video devices to breakout sessions isn't available in this update. Users on devices have to be manually assigned to their intended breakout sessions.
Users on devices won’t be able to choose the breakout session they want to join, when sessions are setup to let participants choose any session.
When a user on a Meetings app is in a breakout session and they try to pair with a device that is already in a breakout session, they will be greeted with a device busy message.
Users on a device aren't able to ask for help when in a breakout session.
Broadcast messages sent by the host aren't visible on devices.
SIP user to see a warning message if they screen share in a restricted meeting
If the host has restricted sharing in a meeting, SIP users will see a message explaining why their sharing attempt failed.

End of support for Office 2010 file sharing
Microsoft discontinued support for Microsoft Office 2010 on October 13, 2020. Starting in 41.10, we can no longer provide support for file sharing in Webex for this version of Office. We recommend upgrading to the latest version of Office or using screen sharing or application sharing.
End of life announcement for join by meeting number using prefix and suffix
Users are longer able to dial into meetings by using a prefix and suffix after October 11, 2021. It will be removed from Meeting settings in Control Hub.
This feature was used widely by customers joining meetings on devices. As there is an existing method to join meetings using the Join button, join by meeting number using prefix and suffix is no longer required.
Webex Meetings APIs
Webex Meetings API support for Webex Events (New)
Developers can now schedule events using the meetings API. The API supports standard CRUD operations in line with the current meetings API video devices. We'll be releasing more API features to support Webex Events (new), so stay tuned to learn more in the coming months.

Now, if a cohost chooses End meeting for all from the leave menu when a host is still actively in the meeting, they will be given a prompt warning them that the host is still in the meeting, asking them to confirm if they really want to end the meeting for everyone, or cancel and leave the meeting instead. This secondary confirmation dialog is supported for Webex Meetings, Webex Events (new and classic).
For more information, see Host a Webex meeting or event - quick reference tasks.

Media enhancements
Webex Video Mesh private meetings
The Private Meeting feature enhances the security of your meeting by terminating the media on your premises. When you schedule a private meeting, the media always terminates on the Video Mesh nodes inside your corporate network with no cloud cascade. Unlike normal meetings, if the local nodes are full, the media doesn’t cascade to the Cisco Webex cloud.
All participants in a private meeting must belong to your organization. They can join using the Webex App or an authenticated video system. Participants with VPN or MRA access to your network can join a private meeting. But nobody can join a private meeting from outside your network.
See the Private Meetings section in the deployment guide and the Schedule a Webex Private Meeting article. For more information, see Cisco Webex Video Mesh Release Notes.
Video Mesh GDM
Video Mesh uses the globally distributed media (GDM) capabilities of Webex to achieve better media routing. To achieve optimal connectivity, Webex selects the nearest cloud media node to your enterprise when performing Video Mesh cascades to Webex. Traffic then passes through the Webex backbone to interact with the Webex microservices for the meeting. This routing minimizes latency and keeps most of the traffic on the Webex backbone and off the internet.
For more information, see the Prepare Your Environment section in the deployment guide.
Device enhancements
Webex devices in breakout sessions
We’re announcing Limited Availability of breakout session support for Webex Devices. Hosts can now move devices to a breakout session to have a more inclusive experience with other users. Users on devices see appropriate prompts as they get assigned and moved to breakout sessions.

Webex scheduled meetings by PSTN host and disable lobby for PSTN host
This feature allows hosts using phone-only to start a Webex scheduled meeting. This capability already exists for Personal Room meetings.
If the site administrator has enabled the following option for Webex scheduled meetings (enabled by default), then the host needs to call from a saved phone number.

  For Personal Room meetings, its not enabled by default and the administrators can enable if needed.
The host can also call from a different phone, but needs to validate the saved phone number by providing the phone number at the time of starting the meeting. This would require the host to have saved a phone number in My phone numbers in Preferences > Audio and Video.

  This option provides enhanced security and has been added to Personal Room meetings as well. The Personal Room setting is disabled by default and the site administrator can choose to enable it for Personal Room meetings.
Additionally, the host needs their host PIN to be able to start the meeting.

  The host PIN has been moved from Preferences > My Personal Room to the Preferences > Audio and Video.
When the host is on phone-only for either Personal Room or Webex scheduled meetings, if the security setting is such that guests can’t get into the meeting directly, then today they are left in the lobby without the ability for phone host to let them in. For a better user experience, the site administrator can now choose if they want to enable the Guests can join without waiting in the lobby when the host starts an unlocked meeting from a phone option to let guests into the meeting directly only when host is on phone. If host is on the app, the guests are still placed in a lobby and the host can view and manage the lobby to let selected attendees in.
The option can be managed individually for Personal Room and Webex scheduled meetings. By default, this option is disabled and the site administrator can choose to enable it.
For more information, see Start a scheduled Webex Meeting by phone and Configure settings for meetings started by phone.
Start or join a Webex scheduled meeting as a host using your saved phone number

For more information, see Move participants to the stage in Webex Meetings and Webex Events.
Improved active speaker switching
We've improved the video response time of the active speaker window on the stage, or when grid view is zoomed in all the way. The active speaker window switches between participant videos more seamlessly as different people in the meeting speak.
For more information, see Move participants to the stage in Webex Meetings and Webex Events.
Pop panels directly from the meeting window
We've made managing panels in the meeting experience even easier! You can now pop out any of the panels directly from the meeting window, without having to go into full-screen view. This makes it easy to float multiple panels, scale them for a closer look, or even move them to another monitor.

Display the attendee's actual phone number on the report
With this update, you can see the attendee's actual phone numbers in the report. Previously, the report may have included a phone number that wasn’t used in the meeting. As the result, the hosts and administrators couldn’t contact those attendees.
Webex supports E.164 phone numbers

Highlighted features for this update
Closed Captions available to all paid plans
Previously, closed captions were only available if you had Webex Assistant. Now, all new meetings and events participants (paid meeting users) will automatically have closed captions and can turn them on in one click. The host doesn’t need to turn on anything for attendees to have it.

  In this update, only Webex Meetings and Webex Events (new) are supported. Support for Webex Events (classic) will be available in a future update.
It was initially communicated that Support for Webex Events (classic) will be available in a future update. However, there’s no plan to support Webex Assistant and Auto Closed Captioning in Webex Events (classic).
If the host is a paid user, then free guest users who join this meeting and can have closed captions.
A captions panel is available when the closed captions feature is turned on. Currently, closed captions will only show English transcription. If a user has the real-time translation add-on, then the English transcription can be translated to 100+ languages. For more information, see the Show or Hide Closed Captions During a Webex Meeting or Event.

Pre-Meeting experience
Increase the meeting number size to 11 digits
With a tremendous increase in meeting traffic, Cisco Webex is quickly running short of meeting numbers. To address this challenge, Webex Meetings, Webex Events (classic and new), Webex Training, and Webex Support sessions meeting numbers will be increased to 11-digits.
We’ll ensure that desktop apps, mobile apps, web app, video devices, our APIs, and our out-of-the-box integrations with Jira, Microsoft Teams, Slack, and others are fully compatible with the meeting number increase. If you’re using Webex APIs with your applications, we request that you test and ensure that your applications are working with this change.

  This change applies only to newly scheduled meetings. The meeting number size increase doesn't affect existing meetings and Personal Room meetings.
This change to 11-digit meeting numbers is scheduled to begin in July 2021. You can find the date for your site based on its cluster at status.webex.com/maintenance.
For more information, see Meeting number size increase.

First participant brought to the stage view and synced is available in recordings
