Prepare on-premises phones for Cisco Headsets
Make sure your Cisco IP Phones are optimized before you deploy your Cisco Headsets.
Configure Cisco IP Phones for Headsets
Most phones connected to Cisco Unified Communications Manager support Cisco Headsets. We recommend that you install the latest phone firmware release and device package before connecting your headset to a phone. When the headset first connects, it downloads the required firmware and begins the upgrade process.
Make sure that the phones on Cisco Unified Communications Manager are properly configured for use with headsets.
The following table describes the fields that control functions related to Cisco Headsets on Cisco Unified Communications Manager.
For more detailed information on all the Cisco IP Phone configuration fields in Cisco Unified Communications Manager, see the Feature Configuration Guide for Cisco Unified Communications Manager.
