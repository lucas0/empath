Synchronize Azure Active Directory users into Control Hub
You can add Webex to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and then synchronize users from the directory in to your organization managed in Control Hub. The synchronization requires no on-premises infrastructure or connectors. This integration keeps your user list in sync whenever a user is created, updated, or removed from the application in Azure AD.
System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)
The integration between users in the directory and Control Hub uses the System for Cross-domain Identity Management ( SCIM) API. SCIM is an open standard for automating the exchange of user identity information between identity domains or IT systems. SCIM is designed to make it easier to manage user identities in cloud-based applications and services. SCIM uses a standardized API through REST.

  Azure AD doesn't synchronize null values. If you set an attribute value to NULL, it is not deleted or patched with a NULL value in Webex. If this limitation affects your users, contact Microsoft for support.
Azure AD Wizard App
Use the Azure AD Wizard App in Control Hub to simplify the synchronization of users and groups with Webex. The Wizard App allows you to easily configure which attributes, users, and groups to synchronize, and to decide whether to synchronize user's avatars to Webex. See Set up Azure AD Wizard App in Control Hub to learn more about the benefits of using the wizard.
