USB forwarding: connect a mouse or keyboard to a Desk Pro
You can connect a USB mouse and/or keyboard to your Desk Pro, and use them for your laptop. USB forwarding works when you have connected your laptop to the USB-C port on a Desk Pro, using either a USB-C-USB-C or a USB-C-USB-A cable.

USB forwarding is not available by default: it must be enabled by your Administrator in Control Hub or the device's web interface.
Plug a USB mouse or keyboard into one of the USB ports on the back or lower right side of your Desk Pro. Then, connect your laptop to the USB-C port on the Desk Pro. The computer will detect the mouse and/or keyboard and the device(s) will be available (assuming the feature has been enabled).
If your computer supports Alt-mode Display Port, over the same cable you can use the Desk Pro as an external monitor, and work directly on it with your mouse and keyboard.
Your connected mouse and keyboard will appear to the computer as 'generic'. This means non-standard features (such as fingerprint activation) are not supported.
