Webex App | Join a Space
You can join an unmoderated space when someone who's already a member of it, adds you to it.
Reach out to your co-workers to get added to spaces that they're already using. Or, start a new space to get your team working together.

  You can't just search, to find available spaces to join. Your search results only show spaces that you've already joined.

  If your organization has public spaces, you can explore and join those spaces without being added by your co-workers. See Webex App | Public Spaces for more information.
