Webex on Flip
Webex on Flip combines the video conferencing capabilities of a Cisco Webex Room Kit Mini with the whiteboarding and content capabilities of a Samsung Flip.
You can use the Webex mode for calling and sharing content and the Flip mode for drawing and cocreation. Use the touchscreen to navigate in the Webex mode, or use the touch controller if one is available.
If you get a call when in Flip mode, the screen goes to Webex mode automatically.
In software version RoomOS March 11.3 and later, you have to install the Flip button on the Room Kit Mini using a macro. Read how to enable the Samsung Flip macro.
