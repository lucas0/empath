Webex App | Use your phone's keypad to access meeting features
If you start or join a meeting by phone only, you don’t have access to the meeting controls in the app. Use the dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) keypad on your phone to mute or unmute yourself and more.
Use these commands when you start a Personal Room meeting by phone only or start a scheduled meeting by phone only.
