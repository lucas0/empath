Configure custom events in Dialogflow CX
Use this article to configure the custom events in Google Dialogflow CX for the Virtual Agent-Voice feature in Webex Contact Center and Contact Center Enterprise solutions.
Custom events and custom payload features provide a better end-user experience and control over a conversation while interacting with the Virtual Agent Voice â€“ CX bot. This custom payload feature sends payload information from the Google CX application to the client side for processing. The custom event feature helps to select a particular event to be invoked under the CX application using the client-side API.
For information about custom events, see https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/events-custom.
1
In the Dialogflow CX console, choose the project and the agent.
2
In the CX agent screen, go to the Build tab. Choose the required flow and the required page (Start/End Flow/End Session) in this flow in which a fulfillment is needed from the contact center application.
The selected page details appear.
3
Under the Routes section, define a route and conditions that satisfy the custom exit criteria for triggering the transition.
4
In this route, under Fulfillment section, click Add dialogue option and choose Custom payload.

  Define a custom payload only. Do not add any other dialogue options.
5
Add the custom payload of type Execute_Request that defines the payload to be sent from CX in the following format:
{
"Execute_Request":{
"Event_Name": "<Name of the event>", 
"Data" : { 
"Params":{ 
"<param1 name>": "<param1 value>", 
"<param2 name>": "<param2 value>"
}

  For Webex Contact Center solution, map this event name to the State Event Name in the Virtual Agent V2 activity in Flow Designer for decision mapping.
For Contact Center Enterprise solution, provide this event name to the VirtualAgentVoice element during re-entry from the on-premises application to cloud.
6
Choose Page in the Transition section to set the transition to the same page when the flow resumes.
7
Create an event handler and provide the event name in the flow builder application. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/reference/rest/v3/EventHandler.
