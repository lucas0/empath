Webex App | Make and answer calls from another app
Extend the calling capabilities of Webex App to Contact Center, Receptionist thin client, or a third-party app. All of your calls are routed through Webex App, while Webex App remains in the background. When you make or answer a call from a different app, you hear a certain tone, letting you know the call is connecting. Just make sure that you don't have any other devices provisioned, such as a desk phone, or that your administrator makes Webex App your primary device.
