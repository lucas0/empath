Wireless sharing with AirPlay
Apple AirPlay is now part of the Webex experience.
Cisco devices now support AirPlay, offering another simple and familiar sharing experience. Wirelessly connect your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to effortlessly share your screen, collaborate, and playback audio and video content.

This functionality works best when your Apple device is running the latest version of iOS/iPadOS/macOS.
If you're an administrator, see this article about configuring AirPlay on a Cisco device, from the device's web interface or Control Hub.
Sharing
Settings
You can share wirelessly to a Cisco device that's been configured for AirPlay. To start sharing with AirPlay:
1
Open the Control Center on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Select Screen Mirroring.
2
Select the Cisco device you want to share to.
3
The Cisco device will show a Passcode (depending on how security settings have been configured for that device).
Your Apple device will request this passcode.
4
Enter the passcode on your Apple device to establish the share.

  On Board and Desk Series, swiping up from the bottom of the homescreen opens the Task Switcher, and you can move to another app. This will end your share.
