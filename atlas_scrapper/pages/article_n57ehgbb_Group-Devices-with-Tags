Group Devices with Tags
You can add custom tags to devices in Cisco Webex Control Hub to make it easier to search for and find devices.
You can use tags to name a group of devices based on a business unit or a physical location. For example, if you tag a device with third floor, and then search for third floor, all devices with that tag show up.
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Devices, and select the device you want to tag.

  Select several devices if you want to edit tags on multiple devices at once and click on Edit Configurations in the toolbar.
2
Select Tags in the panel that opens on the right, add a tag, and click outside the field to apply the tag.
The tag doesn't appear in the device list, only the overview of a device. However, you can use tags in a filter list to find devices with that tag.
