Webex App | Manage all your phone calls in one place
If you make and answer a lot of calls throughout your work day or you manage multiple lines or shared lines, we've got just the thing for you. Just open the multi call window from Webex App. From there, you can make and answer calls, get a quick view of your line status, and easily access some common calling features, such as mute, hold, share, conference, park, barge, transfer, and record.
The following calling features are currently only available if you're set up with Unified CM: line status, barge, and privacy. Find out what calling service you have.
