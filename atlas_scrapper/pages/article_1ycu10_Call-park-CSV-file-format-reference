Call park CSV file format reference
With call park, users can park calls their group. You can add and manage call park groups in bulk using a call park CSV. This article covers the specific fields and values needed for the CSV upload of Webex Calling call park groups.
Known limitations and requirements
Before uploading your call park CSV, make sure to read Bulk provisioning Webex Calling elements using CSV to understand the CSV conventions.
You can either export your current call park groups, which allows you to add, delete, or modify your existing data set, or you can export a sample set of call park groups. Once modified, the file can be uploaded through the bulk features.
It is important to know the mandatory and optional columns, and information that you’ll need to provide when filling out the CSV template. The specific fields for the call park CSV are found in the table below.
The maximum amount of rows is 1,000 (not including the header).

Exporting more than 1000 records will export the data in a zip file format. The zip file contains a single CSV with all the data and multiple files less than 1000 records. The files less than 1000 records are generated for the administrators to quickly import any updates, as importing is limited to CSV of less than 1000 records.
A call park group can have users and/or workspaces. These are referred to as agents. If you're adding or editing a user, enter the user’s email address. For workspaces, enter the workspace name.

A user or workspace can only be assigned to one call park. A call park can only have users from the same location.
Each row can hold a maximum of 50 agents. See Add or Edit more than 50 call park agents at a time, for more information.
