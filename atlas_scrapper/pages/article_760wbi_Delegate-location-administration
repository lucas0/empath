Delegate location administration
As a full administrator, you can delegate administration of certain services in a location.
Location administrators see a limited view of Control Hub, and can configure a certain features for services and devices in their assigned locations.
Users who are assigned the location administrator role cannot have any other administrator role. Also, other administrator roles (full administrator, read-only administrator, and service administrator) cannot be assigned the location administrator role.

  The location administrator role is not supported for organizations where unified-location-exempt=true.
