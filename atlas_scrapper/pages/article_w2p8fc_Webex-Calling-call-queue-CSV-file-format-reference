Webex Calling call queue CSV file format reference
In this article
You can add and manage call queues in bulk using a call queue CSV. This article covers the specific fields and values needed for the CSV upload of Webex Calling call queues.
Known limitations and requirements
Before uploading your call queue CSV, make sure to read Bulk provisioning Webex Calling elements using CSV to understand the CSV conventions.
You can either export your current call queues, which allows you to add, delete, or modify your existing data set, or you can export a sample set of call queues. Once modified, the file can be uploaded through the bulk features.

Exporting CSV file into ZIP file format: When exporting data to a CSV file, the number of records may exceed 1000. In such cases, the ZIP file is downloaded, where the ZIP file contains the fullset of record(s) in a single CSV file. A separate folder containing all the data is brokendown into multiple CSV files with less than 1000 records. These files are generated for the administrators to quickly import any updates and upload.
It is important to know the mandatory and optional columns, and information that you’ll need to provide when filling out the CVS template. The specific fields for the call queue CSV are found in the table below.
The maximum amount of rows is 1,000 (not including the header).
Agents can be users or workspaces. For users, enter the user’s email address. For workspaces, enter the workspace name.
Each row can hold a maximum of 50 agents. See Add or edit more than 50 agents at a time for more information.
