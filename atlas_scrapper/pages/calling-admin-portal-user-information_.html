Configure and manage voicemail settings for a Webex Calling user
In this article
Enable a user's voicemail and voicemail settings in Control Hub by giving them the ability to send calls to voicemail when they're busy or can't get to the phone, to enable voicemail notifications via email or text, or store voice messages in a preferred location.
Configure organizational settings for voicemail
Before you begin managing users’ voicemail settings, you must first configure your organizational settings. These configurations determine the users’ voicemail settings that you can set.
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, select Calling under Services.
Select Service Settings and locate the voicemail panel.

Setting up the extension on the voice portal is a prerequisite to configure voicemails. See Configure voice portals for Webex Calling in Control Hub for details.
You can configure the following:
Voicemail forwarding
When enabled, the settings allow users to forward a voicemail message to another users’ number or extension. If disabled, this prohibits the user to forward voicemail messages, using an external mailbox, or sending a copy of the voicemail message to a specified email address.
To enable this setting, click the toggle.
Voicemail deletion

Voicemails over 180 days old are archived automatically. If you require access to archived voicemails, you are requested to raise a service request with Cisco.
Voicemail deletion allows you to set conditions for expired messages. When enabled, admins can specify the timeframe when messages expire. You can enter the days (1-180) in the provided field. Admins can also set conditions for message deletion.
You can enable the following:
Permissive Deletion—This keeps all unread voicemail messages and deletes those voicemail messages that have expired when a user accesses their mailbox.
Strict Deletion—This deletes all read and unread voicemail messages based on the time frame you set.
To enable this setting, click the toggle and choose the appropriate configuration.
Voicemail passcode
When enabled, the settings allow you to create a time frame in which a person has to change their passcode and how often they can change their passcode again (once it’s changed):
You can set the minimum number of days (1–7) when a passcode can be changed by the user when enabled. When the toggle is off, they can change their passcode multiple times on the same day.

Webex Calling prevents the user from setting one of the older passcodes making the users' passcode more secure
You can set the number of days in which a passcode expires (between 15 and 180) when enabled. When the toggle is off, the passcode never expires.

This feature also extends the passcode history 10–24. That is, it can store each user’s last 24 passcodes and prevent the user from reusing one of those stored passcodes.
To enable this setting, click the toggle and set the appropriate configurations.
Enable voicemail for a user
If you have call forwarding enabled, then those call forward settings override the voicemail settings you configured.

From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com go to Users and select the user that you want to enable voicemail.

To set default greetings, select the Default "busy" message option.
To set your own custom personalized greetings, select the Custom message option and click Upload File to upload your audio (WAV) file or click the Record Message to record the message.
