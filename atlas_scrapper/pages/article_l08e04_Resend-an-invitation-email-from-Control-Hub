Resend an invitation email from Control Hub
When you invite people to your organization from Control Hub, they get a link to get started. If they haven't signed up after two days, they'll automatically get a reminder email. You can manually resend the invitation at any time.

  Reminder emails are not currently available for Webex Meetings users.
