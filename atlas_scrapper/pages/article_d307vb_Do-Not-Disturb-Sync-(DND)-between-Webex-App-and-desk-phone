Do Not Disturb Sync (DND) between Webex App and desk phone
In this article
Integrated experience for Webex calling users by synchronizing Do Not Disturb Status between Webex app and Desk phone.
Overview
When you need time to focus and do not want any incoming call notifications to disturb you, now you do not have to enable Do Not Disturb (DND) on each of your Webex Calling registered clients separately. When you enable it on the Webex app, the state is automatically synchronized to your desk phone. Similarly, when you enable it on your desk phone, the state is automatically synchronized to your Webex apps.
When you set DND status on Webex Calling registered clients, you do not get a notification of the incoming call. The calls go directly to voicemail if the call forward busy setting is configured. The caller hears a busy signal if the voicemail is not configured.
To enable DND on Webex App and Multiplatform Phone (MPP), see: Webex App | Let people know you're busy
Control Do Not Disturb (DND) status sync at organizational level in Control Hub
When the user enables DND on the desk phone and it is synchronized to the Webex app, it disables both call and message notifications. If some users do not want message notifications to be disabled, the admin can disable DND synchronization.
To disable DND synchronization:
1
Log in to the Control Hub https://admin.webex.com
2
Go to Services > Calling > Client Settings.
3
In the Do Not Disturb (DND) Status Sync section, toggle to disable the Allow DND to be synchronized.
