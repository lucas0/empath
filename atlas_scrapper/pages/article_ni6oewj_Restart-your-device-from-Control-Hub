Restart your device from Control Hub
Restart your device from Control Hub
You can restart your device if you are having a technical issue. A device restart from Control Hub doesn't affect your settings and it retains the log files.

  If you do a power cycle, then you lose the recent version of the log files. This makes it difficult to troubleshoot so download the logs before you power cycle the device.

2
Select your device from the inventory and open Advanced Configurations.
3
Click the search bar and select Maintenance > Restart.
4
