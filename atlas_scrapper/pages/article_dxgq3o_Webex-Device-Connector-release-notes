Webex Device Connector release notes
Read about the latest Webex Device Connector software releases. We document new functionality, bug fixes, and general improvements.

Due to an update in one of the backend services, sign in to the Webex Device Connector only works with the latest release (Version 1.1.289 and above). If you are on a release prior to this, you will not be able to sign in.
Use the following links to download the latest version of the software so that you can reauthenticate successfully:
Windows
macOS
In the Webex Device Connector interface, you're notified whenever an upgrade is available. We recommend that you click Update to remain on the latest version of the software for bug fixes and security enhancements:

Updates without release notes are ongoing maintenance releases. They are required updates to keep your Webex Device Connector deployment up to date and secure, but they do not contain changes that affect the functionality or fix specific customer-impacting bugs.
