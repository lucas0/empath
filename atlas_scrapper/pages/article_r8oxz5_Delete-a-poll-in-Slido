Delete a poll in Slido
As a Webex Meetings or Webex Webinars host, you can delete polls that you no longer need or that you created for a trial run.
Slido is available in Webex Meetings. You can use Slido in plans for up to 10,000 users in Webex Webinars on version 41.9 and later sites. Slido polls are available for up to 10,000 attendees, while quizzes are available for up to 5,000 users.
Any poll that you delete from your Slido is permanently deleted.
1
During a meeting or webinar, go to Apps > Slido.
2
Select the Slido that contains the poll.
3
On the Polls tab, locate the poll and click > Delete.
4
Click Delete to confirm you want to delete the poll.
