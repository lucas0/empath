Use reactions in Webex Meetings and Webex Webinars
Animated reactions let participants express themselves without saying anything in a meeting, webinar, or breakout session. Cheer on the speaker with the clapping hands reaction, or appreciate a joke with the haha reaction. As a presenter, you can get a sense of the audience's response by asking participants to give a quick thumbs up or thumbs down.
You can choose from 12 emojis to give instant feedback:
Thumbs up
Clapped hands
Celebrate
Smile
Haha
Wow
Sad
Thumbs down
Slow down
Speed up
Thanks
