In-room booking with a touch controller
With in-room booking you can extend your meeting room booking or book a room for a spontaneous meeting. If the room is available, you can use a touch controller, Touch 10 or Room Navigator, to book the room.
If a meeting room is available, you can book it until midnight the same day, using a touch controller.
When you make a booking from a touch controller, it will appear in the meeting roomâ€™s calendar. It won't show up in your own personal calendar.
To check today's booking tap the Calendar button on the touch controller's home screen.

In-room booking is only available for shared devices.
