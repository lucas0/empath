Send a message to meeting participants without joining the meeting
If you’re invited to a meeting but haven’t joined it, you can still chat with everyone in the meeting. For example, if you're running late to a meeting, let the participants who already joined know that you'll be there soon.
Messages sent during the meeting may save with the meeting content, depending on your organization's meeting chat policy.
Before you begin

This feature is available in meetings associated with a space. The feature isn't available in Personal Room meetings or Webex scheduled meetings.
If you're invited to the meeting but you aren't a member of the space, you can't send messages to the meeting.
