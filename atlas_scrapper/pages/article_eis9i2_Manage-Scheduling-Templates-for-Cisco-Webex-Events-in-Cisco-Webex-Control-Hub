Manage Scheduling Templates for Cisco Webex Events in Cisco Webex Control Hub

Site administrators can use scheduling templates for Webex Events if the same settings are often used when scheduling events.
Scheduling Templates for Webex Events
A scheduling template defines many of the settings for a scheduled event. If hosts often use the same settings for their events, a site administrator can save those settings in a template. When scheduling events, a host can select the template to avoid having to set many of the same options for each event.
There are two types of scheduling templates:
Standard scheduling templates: Available for all hosts. A Webex service includes a set of standard templates, and site administrators can also make hostsâ€™ personal templates available as standard templates.
Personal scheduling templates: A template that a host sets up and that is available only for that host. A host can create a personal template from within the event scheduler, by using the Save As Template option. When saving a template, the host can also save the template as a standard template, by selecting Save As Standard Template. The template then appears in the list of standard templates.

After saving the template, only the host images that were uploaded remain. All other files uploaded to the template like the meeting materials and the image description are deleted.
In the list of standard templates for Webex Events, site administrators can:
Show or hide any standard template, including those templates that hosts create and save as a standard template.
Make any standard template the default template for Webex Events.
Delete a standard template from a Webex site.
