Feature access codes for Webex Calling
Feature access codes (FACs), also known as star codes, give you access to advanced calling features. Your Webex App and your IP phone support FACs.
For some of the features below, you need to get a dial tone before entering the code. For example, if you're on a call that you want to park, place the call on hold, get a dial tone, and then enter *68. You can then enter the extension at which you want to park the call or # to park the call on your own extension.

The codes below aren't designed to work with Webex Meetings. See Use DTMF commands in your Personal Room Meetings for DTMF keys you can use with Meetings.
