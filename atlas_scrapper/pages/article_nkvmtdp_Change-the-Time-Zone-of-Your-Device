Change the Time Zone of Your Device
If you travel across time zones, you can use Cisco Webex to change the time zone that your device displays.
Your administrator sets the time zone for all devices in your company. If you often travel or work regularly in a different time zone, you can change the time zone of your device to reflect your local time.

Your voicemail uses the company-wide time zone.
