Choose how the Hybrid Calendar Service localizes meeting details
You can use the global setting in Control Hub to determine the language that the Hybrid Calendar Service uses for all join details added to meetings in your organization. This setting is useful if you have a legal requirement to present information in one particular language and need to override the language that schedulers set for their own calendar, mailbox, or invitation.
If you do not change the default to a specific language for the organization, the Hybrid Calendar determines which language to use differently, depending on the calendar integration type:
Calendar integration type
Default if no specific language chosen
Office 365 (using the Microsoft Graph API through the cloud-based service)
"language":{"locale"} setting from the scheduler's mailbox settings
Google G Suite Calendar
locale setting from scheduler's calendar settings
Microsoft Exchange or Office 365 (using EWS through the Expressway-based Calendar Connector)
item.Culture property from the meeting invitation
1
Sign in to Control Hub at https://admin.webex.com and go to Services > Hybrid.
2
From the Hybrid Calendar card for your calendar environment, click Edit settings.

  If you have the Hybrid Calendar Service set up for multiple calendar environments, you can access the Default Language setting from multiple places in Control Hub. Setting it in one location overrides the setting in any other location and changes the join details language for all meetings that the Hybrid Calendar processes.

In the Meeting Invitations section, choose a language from the Default Language drop-down list, and click Save.
After you save the change, the Hybrid Calendar uses the language you choose each time it adds join to details a meeting. It doesnâ€™t change the language for existing join details.
