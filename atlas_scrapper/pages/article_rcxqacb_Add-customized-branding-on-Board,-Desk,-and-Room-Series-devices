Add customized branding on Board, Desk, and Room Series devices
You can customize the screen of your device and touch controller with your logo and brand image without compromising the user experience.
Branding in half-wake state
For the half-wake state, you can add a custom background image and a logo.


When the device wakes up, the background image is shown in full color. After a few seconds, the image is automatically dimmed with a transparent black overlay. You can use an image in PNG or JPEG format. The recommended size is 1920x1080 pixels.
We recommend using a white logo in PNG-format on transparent background to make it more visible on the dark background brand image. Minimum size is 272x272 pixels. The logo is scaled automatically so that it fits the slot.
Branding in awake state
For the awake state, you can add a logo on the screen and the Touch controller.


We recommend that you use a dark or black logo in PNG-format on transparent background. The device adds a light overlay with 40% opacity so that the logo and the other user interface elements blend together. Minimum size is 272x272 pixels. The logo is scaled automatically so that it fits the slot.

The standard text about how to use the device canâ€™t be customized.
Applying custom branding or Cisco default visuals on organizational level overrides branding on individual devices.
To enable organization wide branding for devices linked with Webex Edge for Devices, go to Devices > Settings > Webex Edge for Devices and toggle on Allow Control Hub to manage configurations.
Custom branding is not supported on the following devices:
Cisco TelePresence SX10
Cisco IP Phones

All devices in your organization
Individual devices
Set Cisco default branding on all devices in your organization
