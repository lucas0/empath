What is the difference between toll and toll-free?
Solution:
A toll call is when a participant calls into a toll number and generally pays the long distance fees that are associated with the call. The Webex subscriber pays the toll rate (as defined in the contract) for audio usage.
A toll-free call is when a participant calls into a region-specific toll-free number (within the US the area code is 800, 866, 877, 888, etc.) and generally does not pay a fee to call into that number. The Webex subscriber pays the toll-free rate for audio usage. The participant may be charged for long distance by the telephone company if the toll-free number they are calling into is outside of the region or country they are calling from.
