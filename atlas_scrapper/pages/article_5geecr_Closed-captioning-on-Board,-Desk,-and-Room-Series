Closed captioning on Board, Desk, and Room Series
You can toggle on closed captioning in a meeting from your device. With closed captioning you won’t miss a word.

Closed captioning isn’t available in space-backed meetings.
With closed captioning, you can see a maximum 3x3 view with the Grid layout.
All participants can choose whether they want to have closed captioning on the screen of their own device. Tap the Captions button from the call controls, and toggle closed captioning on or off.
Don't speak the language? You can now choose to translate from English to one of the 100+ languages that are supported on the RoomOS devices. We also support translation from 12 languages to English. We can translate meetings where any of the following languages are spoken: Chinese Mandarin (Simplified), Chinese Mandarin (Traditional), Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish.
Languages that we translate to from English are listed in the Real time translation in Webex Meetings and Events article.
Real-time translation is an add-on, and purchase of this feature will include the Webex Assistant subscription.
