Webex App | Archive a team space
After your team has been working together for a while, you might have spaces that no one is using anymore. When you archive a team space, you're not deleting it, but it moves from your spaces list to your Archived Spaces list and it won't be included in searches. You can only archive team spaces, not your other spaces.
Desktop
iOS
Android
Web
Open the team space that you want to archive, go to Space Information , and then select Archive space.
