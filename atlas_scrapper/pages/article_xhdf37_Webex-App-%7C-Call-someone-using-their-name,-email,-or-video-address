Webex App | Call someone using their name, email, or video address
In Webex App, you can easily search, call, and meet with someone just by typing their name or email address. If you're making a call to a room device, simply enter the video address and enjoy your meeting.
If your administrator adds external contacts, these contacts appear in search results.

Mobile
You can use the app header in Webex App to call someone else who uses the app. The system automatically dials the phone number assigned to the contact. If there's not a phone number to dial, the assigned email address is used.
On your desktop app, click Search, meet, and call, type the name, email address, or video address, and then click to make an audio call, or to make a video call.

  If you're set up with a phone service such as Unified CM, Webex Calling, or Calling hosted by a Service Provider, you also have access to a dial pad and can make a call from there. Just click and enter a person's name, email address, or video address (such as for a room device) in the dial pad.
