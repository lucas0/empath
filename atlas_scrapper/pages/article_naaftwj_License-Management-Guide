License Management Guide
Helps partners and customers remove licenses from inactive users, either one-by-one or in bulk via CSV.
Introduction
Cisco has enabled True Forward (TF) automation for Collaboration Flex Plan 3.0 Enterprise Agreements, eliminating manual touches for the annual TF process.
This automation applies to Collaboration Flex Plan 3.0 Enterprise Agreement Cloud deployed subscriptions:
Webex Suite
Meetings Enterprise Agreement
Webex Calling Enterprise Agreement
Meetings + Webex Calling Pack Enterprise Agreement
Collaboration Flex Plan EA offers not listed here use the same annual True Forward methodology but require manual orders.
If the account is Overconsumed on the Last Day of the 11th Lifecycle Month, a True Forward is required on the True Forward Anniversary Date (TFAD).
An account is overconsumed when the number of Entitled (Licensed) Users exceeds the number of EA Licenses purchased, plus a 20% growth allowance.
For the Webex Suite subscription, an account is overconsumed when the number of Entitled (Licensed) Users exceeds the number of EA Licenses purchased, plus a 15% growth allowance.
To support an accurate Collaboration FLEX EA True Forward, it is important to audit Meetings and Calling licenses prior to the last day of the 11th month. All assigned licenses are measured, regardless of the user status.
