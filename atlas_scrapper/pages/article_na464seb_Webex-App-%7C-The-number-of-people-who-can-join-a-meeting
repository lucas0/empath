Webex App | The number of people who can join a meeting
What type of account you have, how you schedule or start your meetings, and how participants choose to join determines how many people can join your meetings.
Webex scheduled and Personal Room meetings
When you schedule a Webex or Personal Room meeting from your calendar, the number of people who can join your meeting depends on your Webex license and how you join. No matter how many participants your license allows, only a maximum of 500 people can join from a video device or Webex App. Video devices and Webex App participants also count toward your meeting size limit.
If your meetings are running on the Video Mesh-ready meeting platform, a maximum of 500 people can join from a video device or Webex App. Find out if your meetings are running on the Video Mesh-ready meeting platform.
Meetings associated with a space
Weâ€™ve enhanced the meeting experience in a space. Some of you may still have the classic experience.
Enhanced meetings associated with a space
Different spaces have different meeting capabilities, depending on the type of account held by the meeting host. In spaces where the host has a free account, up to 100 people can attend your meeting. In spaces where the host has a paid Webex Calling, Webex App, or Meetings account, up to 400 people can attend.
Classic meetings associated with a space
When you schedule or start a meeting in the app, you can see how many people can join.
In the space, click Schedule to see the meeting information.
If you select Learn more, you can find out more information about the meeting capabilities of the space.
Different spaces have different meeting capabilities, depending on the type of account held by the meeting sponsor. In spaces where the sponsor has a free account, up to 25 people can attend your meeting. In spaces where the host has a paid Webex Calling, Webex App, or Meetings account, up to 400 people can attend. Any number of guests without Webex App accounts may join the meeting, but they're also counted toward the meeting size limit. For more information, see Meeting capabilities and meeting sponsors.
How people and devices count towards the meeting size limit
The meeting size limit is counted the same way for a scheduled Webex Meeting or Personal Room meeting, and a meeting associated with a space. Each person that joins your meeting counts as 1 toward the meeting size limit, regardless of whether they're connected to a video device or not. A connected video device in the meeting also counts toward the meeting size limit. For example, if you're in a conference room with two other people and you're all connected to one room device, you count as 4 total (each app plus the room device).

How video devices and Webex App participants count towards the video devices limit
The video devices limit is counted the same way for a scheduled Webex Meeting or Personal Room meeting, and a meeting associated with a space. Each video device that joins your meeting counts as 1 toward the video devices limit, regardless of how many people are connected to it. Each person who joins using Webex App also counts as 1 video device, whether they're connected to a video device or not. For example, if you're in a conference room with three other people and you're all connected to a room device from Webex App, you'll count as 5 total video devices (each person, plus the room device).
