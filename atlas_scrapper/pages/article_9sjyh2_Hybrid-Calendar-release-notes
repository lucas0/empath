Service update (no Connector release)
March 15, 2021
We've improved the way that we process meeting invitations for organizers and attendees. We expect this improvement to address some of the general scheduling issues such as invitations sent to distribution lists. We're gradually rolling out and monitoring this change across geographies.
In addition, room calendar events are now read directly from the room calendar in the calendar system. This change is intended to improve meetings list accuracy for room systems.

  For the One Button to Push (OBTP) Join button to work consistently for Webex room devices, ensure that the mail system does not have a policy to automatically delete meeting comments. Hybrid Calendar uses comments to process meetings. The following PowerShell command retains comments:
Set-CalendarProcessing -identity "room" -DeleteComments $false
8.11-1.0.7889

8.11-1.0.7339
June 15, 2020

  An installation issue has been discovered in version 8.11-1.0.7339. To correct the issue, version 8.11-1.0.7323 is redeployed. Calendar Connectors which attempt to upgrade to 8.11-1.0.7339 may see the following alarm: "Could not download connector Calendar Connector from https://binaries-test.webex.com/CalendarConnectorStable/20200615233010/calendar-production-stable.tlp." Ignore this alarm.
Fixed an issue where the meeting join link may no longer appear in the Webex Cisco Webex Teams app for meetings which are in the past.

Fixed the initialization issue with the Cisco TMS integration.
8.11-1.0.7285
May 4, 2020
Includes a change that allows joining a Webex meeting using the join URL.
This change uses the SIP URI dial-in number (if found) to look up and retrieve the associated join URL. When a user attempts to join such a meeting from Webex Teams, the join URL joins the meeting instead of the SIP URI dial-in number.
8.11-1.0.7277
April 22, 2020
Includes scalability enhancements.
Includes a fix for the "Meeting Processing Queue Limit Reached" alarm.

Includes support for organizations in the European region.
8.11-1.0.7057
February 11, 2020
Fixed an issue where attempting to log into the Expressway admin interface results in "Login expired: Invalid cookie", due to the disk filling up with GSSAPIBindRequest-JAAS-Config configuration files in the tmp folder. We have improved how we delete these files.
Updated the copyright date from 2019 to 2020 in the @meet and @webex meeting templates.
8.11-1.0.7046
January 13, 2020
Updated heartbeat mechanism calendar connector uses to check connectivity with the cloud.
When an organizer creates a meeting from an existing Webex Cisco Webex Teams space (either from the schedule button or by copying and pasting the space information into the meeting invitation) and adds attendees who are not Webex Cisco Webex Teams users, the Hybrid Calendar Service no longer sends an error email to the organizer indicating that these attendees couldn’t be added to the space.
8.11-1.0.6252
November 25, 2019
Fixed a crash in the Calendar Connector which was triggered by an internal metrics process.
8.11-1.0.6185
October 28, 2019
Fixed an issue where meeting invitations with @meet in the location field may result in multiple lines of text "When it's time, join the Webex Cisco Webex Teams meeting here." appearing in the meeting body.
Fixed an issue which is causing the "Meeting Processing too long" alarm to be raised and lowered repeatedly.
Updated text font used for call-in number country labels for @meet and @webex meeting invitations.
8.11-1.0.6155
October 7, 2019
The Hybrid Calendar Service can now parse Cisco Webex Personal Room links in a format like site.webex.com/meet/<userid> (the https:// prefix is no longer required). The service can parse the link from either the location or body of a meeting invitation and use it to provide join notifications (One Button to Push).
Fixed an issue with the Cisco TMS integration where the Calendar Connector could encounter a proxy error and fail to initialize after a restart. When this happens, the administrator sees the alarm "Conferencing Connector initialization failed."
On the Calendar Connector administration page on Expressway, removed the redundant “Configure Cisco Webex Meetings Site” link from the Related Tasks section.
8.11-1.0.6104
September 12, 2019
No release notes for this maintenance upgrade.
8.11-1.0.6078

September 2, 2019: Rerelease of 8.11-1.0.6078 to fix issue with installs and upgrades with version that is released on August 30.
Improved subscription error handling. The internal service URL is retried if the external service URL fails during the user subscription process.
Fixed an issue where many autodiscovery retries are attempted for users with no mailboxes.
Combined the Applications > Hybrid Services > Calendar Service > Cisco Webex Meetings Site Configuration menu option with the Cisco Conferencing Services Configuration menu option on the Cisco Expressway connector host.
8.10-1.0.5848
August 8, 2019
Updated @meet and @webex meeting templates to version 2.2.0.0.
8.10-1.0.5817
July 22, 2019
Updated the @webex meeting template to list the join-by-phone call-in numbers in the correct order.
8.10-1.0.5798
June 28, 2019
Deployed to the cloud on June 24, 2019: Change for issue where, when a user specified two toll numbers or two toll-free as their Webex call-in number preferences, only one number is shown in the @webex meeting invitation. The change allows both toll or toll-free call-in numbers to be shown in the @webex invite.
8.10-1.0.5744
June 5, 2019
Fixed an issue where the join notification is shown in Webex App. This includes even after the @webex keyword is removed from the meeting location field and the join links are removed from the meeting body.
8.10-1.0.5720
May 24, 2019
Fixed an issue where meeting attendees may receive multiple meeting updates in their inbox each time an attendee accepted or declined the meeting invitation.
8.10-1.0.5713
May 8, 2019
Fixed a configuration template issue causing CSCvp39013: Error saving new Microsoft Exchange Configuration: Caught exception: null.
Updated @meet join details to support two join-by-phone toll numbers. If two toll numbers exist in Webex, both show up in @meet invitations.
Performance optimizations.
8.10-1.0.5609
April 2, 2019
Fixed an issue where the Calendar Connector may become nonoperational if the administrator selects Calling in Webex Teams (Unified CM) as their Calling Behavior method in Control Hub.
Addressed an issue where @meet invitations with join links that are copied into the invite body create a new space.
Addressed an issue where user accounts remain in pending activation status due to XML parsing error.
Added support for cases when a double “sip:sip:” format is detected in meeting invitation join links (in addition to a single “sip:” format).
Addressed an issue which resulted in no join notification (no OBTP) for some 1:1 space meetings.
Updated the copyright date to 2019 in @meet and @webex meeting template﻿.
8.10-1.0.5545
February 20, 2019
No release notes for this maintenance upgrade.
8.10-1.0.5533
January 25, 2019
Fixed CSCvo03678 Autodiscover fails for accounts with redirectURL.
Backed out an OBTP join notification change from December for Cisco TMS/TMSXE integrations. The change caused the removal of the bridge for meetings that are scheduled on Cisco TMS after they were processed by the Hybrid Calendar Service.
On the Microsoft Exchange Configuration page, added an Enable SCP record lookup option in the Discovery section. When unchecked, the Calendar Connector will not attempt an SCP lookup in Active Directory during the Autodiscover process. (See the January 4, 2018 entry in What's New with Cisco Webex Hybrid Services for more information.)
On the Microsoft Exchange Configuration page, the maximum length of the Service Account Password field has changed from 120 through 128 characters.
Cisco TMS/TMSXE systems now send OBTP join notifications if there is a non-Cisco SIP URI in the location field of the meeting invitation.
Fixed one scenario which may raise the “Meeting processing time too long” alarm.
8.10-1.0.5475
December 7, 2018
Updated @meet and @webex meeting invitation template to version 2.1.0.0. Changes include adding the Meeting Number field toward the top of the template, consistent placement of the global call-in number links and consistent font size formatting.
A user who is not a Webex App user is unable to participate in meetings or join a Webex Cisco Webex Teams space. If invited, the meeting organizer receives an email Notifying them that an attendee could not be added to the space.
The Hybrid Calendar Service now detects join links with the *@meetup.webex.com format for OBTP join notifications.
Previously, the Calendar Connector could fill the disk with GSSAPIBindRequest-JAAS-Config configuration files in the .tmp folder. These files are deleted as they are created, to avoid filling the disk space.
Previously, if an Exchange environment used a redirect for invalid URLs and the redirect displayed a response with data, the Hybrid Calendar retried the URL. These redirects can cause excessive requests to the web server. Now, the Hybrid Calendar marks the redirect as invalid if it doesn't recognize the data.
Allowed TMS/XE systems to send OBTP join notifications if there was a Webex App space meeting link URL in the invitation.
8.10-1.0.5328
October 12, 2018
Fixed CSCvk79308—Calendar Connector SCIM client fails to traverse credentialed web proxy (Exchange setup page).
Fixed CSCvm78853—Static Exchange configuration won't save.
Updated the field help and character entry limit for the Redirect URL text box on the Autodiscover Redirect URL Trust List configuration page.
Added support for the new Default Language setting in Cisco Webex Control Hub.
Fixed an issue which prevented @meet invitations from being processed for some users with uppercase characters in their email address.
Fixed a logging issue when saving the Microsoft Exchange configuration.
Internal performance optimization to reduce requests to a cloud service.
8.10-1.0.5279
September 14, 2018
Added an Expressway configuration page that administrators can use to allow or block Autodiscover redirection URLs. Running an Autodiscover test automatically adds URLs to the list in pending state, or administrators can add URLs to the list manually. Administrators allow pending URLs.
8.10-1.0.5260
September 7, 2018
Updated the Calendar Connector version numbering from 8.8.-1.0.xxxx to 8.10-1.0.xxxxx.
Allow join notifications with both @spark in the meeting location field and Webex Productivity Tools in the meeting body to appear on Webex App platforms.
Allow the Skype for Business join link to appear in @webex meeting invitations when users are not in the Webex app. (This issue was fixed in the cloud and does not require a Calendar Connector upgrade.)
8.8-1.0.5219
August 17, 2018
We've introduced @meet as a new keyword, and new keyword modifiers :space and :myroom to control the behavior of the @meet and @webex keywords.
The keyword @meet and the compound keywords @meet:space or @webex:space all create a space in Webex App.
The compound keywords @meet:myroom and @webex:myroom work the same way as @webex, using the user's Cisco Webex Personal Room. Each option adds the appropriate join details to the body of the meeting invitation.
Users with multiple Cisco Webex sites can still use @webex:<site> for the time being, but we strongly recommend configuring the My Personal Room setting in the Cisco Webex Teams app to specify which site @webex uses. This setting also indicates which site the app monitors participants entering the user's Personal Room lobby.
The @spark keyword continues to work for the time being. However, if your organization is currently using @spark, use @webex:space or @meet.
Fixed issue present in Calendar Connector build 5201 where the Calendar Connector may stop operating if the hybridservices.c_cal logging level is set to DEBUG.
Permit join notifications to work when using @webex with FedRAMP, telephony service provider (Cisco TAPI Service Provider), and CMR Hybrid Webex sites. (This issue does not require a Calendar Connector upgrade.)
8.8-1.0.5194
August 3, 2018
Fixed issue to allow parsing of SIP URI join links from meeting invitations using both the "sip%3A" and "sip:" formats. Previously "sip%3A" did not result in a join notification appearing in the Webex App.
Fixed issue where @spark or @webex meetings mistakenly had double sip:sip:<URI> in the SIP URI joinable link. This caused failures when attempting to join these meetings. To address this issue, we no longer add sip.
8.8-1.0.5158
July 19, 2018
Fixed the top priority issue configuring the Calendar Connector on Expressway X8.11, which was causing two problems:
Entering an email address in the Discovery section of the Microsoft Exchange Configuration page causes the configuration to fail. The only way to configure a new Calendar Connector or change the Exchange configuration is by leaving the Email Address field blank. You will not be able to test your configuration as you save it. You can use the steps in Test Microsoft Exchange Autodiscovery and Impersonation to simulate the test from a machinewith the network conditions similar to the Expressway-C.
On the Webex Configuration page, using the Test Connection button causes the same failure. The workaround is to click Save without testing.
Rebranding updates for the user email notification template.
Added German localization for "Join using Microsoft Skype for Business" text in meeting invitations.
Fixed the integration of @spark meetings with TMS/XE (added sip: protocol prefix to SIP URIs).
Fixed an issue where cancelled meetings occasionally would not be removed immediately from the Webex Cisco Webex Teams meetings list.
Added retry logic to help ensure meeting join notifications appear when other backend services are busy.
8.8-1.0.5077
June 15, 2018
For meeting invitations which only include a Webex Personal Room URL in the meeting body (with no SIP URI), clicking the join notification (OBTP) in the Webex Cisco Webex Teams app will now join the meeting through the Webex Cisco Webex Teams app. Previously, clicking the join notifications for these meetings would cross-launch the meeting in a Webex browser window.
Updated text strings in email notifications for Webex Teams rebranding.
Updated text strings in the Expressway user interface for Webex Cisco Webex Teams rebranding.
8.8-1.0.5045
June 8, 2018
No release notes for this maintenance upgrade.
8.8-1.0.5037
June 1, 2018
Updated the join link text in the @spark meeting invite from "Join Cisco Spark meeting" to "Join Cisco Webex Teams meeting"
Fixed an issue where users who are not enabled for Hybrid Calendar Service may not receive meeting join notifications (OBTP).
8.8-1.0.5008
May 18, 2018
Fixed one cause of the "Meeting processing time too long" alarm, which would sometimes be triggered due to processing a high volume of attendee responses.
Fixed scenario where invitees who declined a meeting were counted against the maximum attendee limit. Because of this scenario, some attendees would not receive the meeting join notification (OBTP).
8.8-1.0.4985
May 11, 2018
No release notes for this maintenance upgrade.
8.8-1.0.4979
May 4, 2018
For @webex meeting invitations, added "Join using Microsoft Skype for Business" link and localized text translations
Fixed an issue where users with mixed-case email addresses have a time when updates to their Outlook calendar meetings aren't detected.
Fixed an issue where 1-1 meetings created from a Cisco Webex Teams space always get added to the private 1-1 space instead of the space from which the meeting was created.
Fixed an issue where some meeting join links were not parsed properly if the user did not enter a carriage return after the join link.
Fixed an issue where a copied and pasted Cisco Spark space URL was not being detected in the Outlook meeting location field.
Updated the @spark and @webex template copyright year to 2018.
If an autodiscovery URL for a user's email domain was found via SCP lookup in Active Directory and the initial autodiscovery response from Exchange returned a RedirectTarget address, the Calendar Connector reused the original autodiscovery URL that was retrieved via SCP rather than a new URL based on the RedirectTarget address. This could cause a flow loop where the actual user settings were never retrieved and that user could never be assigned to a Calendar Connector or activated. This is now fixed so that the email domain of the RedirectTarget address is always used to acquire the next autodiscovery URL in the flow.
Fixed how the TLS configuration is applied for the Microsoft Exchange Autodiscover process. In the Calendar Connector Exchange configuration, there are two different settings that can dictate whether certificate validation is performed when making a secure connection. Each of these settings has an option of On or Off. If set to On, certificate validation is performed. If set to Off, no certificate validation is performed. The settings and their intended scopes are as follows:
TLS Verify Mode—This setting is used when making a connection to Exchange.
LDAP TLS Verify Mode—This setting is used when making a connection to an LDAP server to search for Exchange Autodiscover SCP records.
Prior to the fix, the LDAP TLS Verify Mode was used for all connections during the Exchange Autodiscover process, regardless of whether performing an LDAP query or an Exchange request. So if LDAP TLS Verify Mode was On and TLS Verify Mode was Off, certificate validation was always performed when connecting to Exchange during Autodiscover. Conversely, if LDAP TLS Verify Mode was Off and TLS Verify Mode was On, certificate validation was not performed when connecting to Exchange during Autodiscover.
After the fix, LDAP TLS Verify Mode is used only when making a connection to an LDAP server during Autodiscover, and TLS Verify Mode is used for all other connections involved in the Autodiscover process.
Fixed how the Calendar Connector searches for SCP pointers.
Autodiscover flow steps are explained in https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ee332364%28v=exchg.140%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396.
For step 1 (SCP lookup), further detail is provided in https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/dn467395(v=exchg.150).aspx.
The second link explains the difference between the two types of SCP objects for Autodiscover provided by Exchange:
SCP pointers—These objects contain information that points to specific LDAP servers that should be used to locate Autodiscover SCP objects for the user's domain. SCP pointers are stamped with the following GUID: 67661d7F-8FC4-4fa7-BFAC-E1D7794C1F68.
SCP URLs—These objects contain URLs for Autodiscover endpoints. SCP URLs are stamped with the following GUID: 77378F46-2C66-4aa9-A6A6-3E7A48B19596.
Prior to the fix, the Calendar Connector search for SCP pointers was not working properly. However, search for SCP URLs was working properly all along, and SCP URLs are the common type necessary for successful Autodiscover. There were no known reports of Calendar Connector Autodiscover failing due to unsuccessful SCP pointer lookup; the problem was only found by means of code review. With this fix, the Calendar Connector search for SCP pointers now works properly.
8.8-1.0.4896
March 29, 2018
Logging cleanup
Fix to address a possible split meeting occurrence when a meeting is scheduled with Productivity Tools and @webex.
Partial fix for participants whose email addresses are enclosed in single quotes. For @spark invitations, the Calendar Service now adds these participants to the Cisco Spark space. However, we are awaiting a fix from Microsoft to be able to update these participants' meeting invitations with the join details.
Fix to no longer falsely raise the alarm "Cisco Collaboration Meeting Rooms (CMR) service unreachable or access denied."
Addressed an issue seen at one customer, where users were stuck in pending activation state due to network latency reaching the Cisco Collaboration Cloud. Increased a timeout value to allow user activation.
8.8-1.0.4724
February 2, 2018
When a proxy is configured, the Calendar Service > Cisco WebEx Configuration page on Expressway no longer enforces DNS resolution.
Fix to address alarm: "Meeting processing time too long; Calendar Service meeting processing time exceeds a threshold of 5 minutes for at least one user."
8.8-1.0.4703
January 20, 2018
Fix for the Expressway Calendar Connector User Subscription status page. Users without subscriptions that are waiting to retry subscription are now counted in the users with failed subscription totals.
8.8-1.0.4696
January 12, 2018
Improved the Calendar Connector - Microsoft Exchange Configuration page for Hybrid Exchange On-Premise / Office365 deployments. Allow both NTLM and Basic authentication types to be selected. When one method fails then the other method is attempted.
Enabled Cisco Spark desktop join notifications for meetings where the meeting organizer puts someone else’s WebEx Personal Room link in the meeting location field.
Change to reduce number of "Retrieving key from encryption service failed" alarms raised.
Fix to allow Calendar Connector to return to an operational state after a cloud connectivity interruption (reported on the Expressway as a "mercury error").
8.8-1.0.4646
December 1, 2017
Updated the "Join Cisco Spark meeting" URL within @spark 1-1 meeting invites. The new join URL will now launch the Cisco Spark app instead of launching the Cisco Spark web client.
Fixed scenario where some declined meetings were still appearing in the meeting list on Cisco spark desktop apps. If the user declines the entire meeting series, all instances of the meeting should now be removed from the meeting list.
8.8-1.0.4636
November 24, 2017
Fixed issue where Exchange configuration test fails but changes are saved and success is reported.
