Prevent AI Bots from Joining Webex Meetings
As a Webex administrator, you can prevent bots, such as AI transcription services, from joining Webex meetings by automatically blocking email addresses from that service.
If a service that you want to block isn't listed, contact Cisco support to see if they can get it added to the list. You need to provide them with bot's email address. See How Do I Get Help with Webex? for more information.
