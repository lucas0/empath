Webex App | Change your video settings
When you have multiple cameras, select the default to use for your meetings. Virtual camera software, external webcams, and Webex App Room or Desk devices can be selected just like a built-in webcam. On mobile, you can switch between front and back-facing cameras and set virtual backgrounds.
You can also turn off your video for all incoming calls, turn off your video before you join a meeting, or choose not to start your video when you join meetings.
