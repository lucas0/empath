Use the Join Webex Button on a Video Device to Join Webex Meetings
SIP video devices within the same company can now connect to meetings without being prompted for a host PIN or key. If the meeting host is running late or can't make it, you can join and host the meeting from a video device on WBS39.5 and later sites.
Hosts must first allow video devices to host their meetings in their Personal Room Preferences or when scheduling meetings.

Only SIP TLS-based connections are supported with this feature. SIP TCP and H.323 connections arenâ€™t supported.
