Manage phone numbers in Control Hub
In this article
As an administrator, you can manage phone numbers in Control Hub. You’re able to view, activate, remove, and add phone numbers to your organization, as well as move phone numbers from one location to another.
Add phone numbers
Before you begin
Numbers must follow E.164 format for all countries, except for the United States, who can also follow the National format.
Depending on the country, the numbers are formatted according to local dialing requirements. For example, if a country code is required, you can enter numbers with or without the code, and the code is prepended.
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Servcies, and choose Calling > Numbers.
2
Click Manage > Add.
3
Choose a location from the Location drop-down menu.
4
Click Next.
5
To activate numbers later, toggle on Activate Numbers Later.

  When this option is enabled, phone numbers are available for configuration immediately, but need to be activated by contacting your carrier directly. Enable this option if you are porting numbers over at a later time.
6
Enter each phone number to be added. Separate each number using a comma.

  You can add up to 1,000 numbers.

  Numbers are automatically validated when you add a comma or press Enter.
7
Click Save.
The new phone numbers appear in your numbers list.

  Additional validation occurs after you click Save. For example, if a number being added already exists for the location, an error message appears, and you can't save. Remove any invalid numbers and click Save again.
