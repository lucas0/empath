GIPHY integration for Webex App
If you have Pro Pack for Control Hub, you can configure or remove the GIPHY integration for Webex App users in your organization. You can also control whether specific groups of users can see website previews when links are posted to spaces.
With the Webex App integration with GIPHY, users can share animated GIFs from the GIPHY library.
You can enable or disable this integration for your whole organization or for specific groups.
You can also select the GIPHY content rating of animated GIFs that users may share, but this control governs the whole organization and is not available for specific groups.
If GIPHY integration is disabled, users can still paste GIFs from other applications into Webex App messages.

  If you subscribe to Webex from your Service Provider, your Provider manages your app settings. Please contact your Provider's support team to have your settings changed.
