Change Users' Phone Numbers
In this article
Overview
You can change one or many users' phone numbers through Control Hub. The changes are committed to the users' records in the Webex identity store.
Here are the scope and limitations of this feature:
You can only change primary phone numbers through Control Hub.
Enter numbers only as they should be dialled; we don't normalize the number format.
You cannot change user numbers that were synchronized to Webex from your Active Directory.
Edit the numbers in Active Directory instead. See https://www.cisco.com/go/hybrid-services-directory for how to configure and run the AD synchronization.
You can change numbers for users who have Webex Calling, although this is not the only mechanism you can use for Webex Calling, and you could get conflicts.
You can change numbers for users who have Cisco Webex Free Calling.
You can change numbers for users who have Calling in Webex (Unified CM).
You must not use Control Hub to change numbers for Webex for BroadWorks users.
