Join Zoom Meetings on Board, Desk, and Room Series
Join a Zoom meeting with One Button To Push (OBTP), or by tapping the Zoom button directly from your Cisco device.
You can join Zoom meetings from your Board, Desk, and Room Series device by enabling it in Control Hub. This is set up by your system administrators and depends on the type of device you have. Note that a CSC license is required when you participate in a Zoom meeting. Once this is configured, you can simply enter the meeting number and the passcode without having to build the SIP URI, giving a better meeting join experience.
Join with One Button to Push
One Button to Push is available on devices where the hybrid calendar is enabled. When users schedule Zoom meetings and include devices, a join button appears on the device right before the meeting begins. Simply tap Join to enter the meeting.
Join by dialing into the meeting
You need the code provided in your calendar invite or at the end of the meeting link in order to join a Zoom Meeting with your device. Once you have the code you can join by selecting the Zoom button on your device.


After tapping next, select if you are the meeting host or not. If you are the host, enter the host passcode.
In meeting controls
All call controls and features available in Zoom meetings can be accessed in the meeting with a Touch Controller connected to your device, as shown below.


On Board and Desk series, the Zoom call controls are also available, as shown below.


Tap Host options to access the host controls.


Tap Layout to access the different layout options.


Tap More to access more settings.


Limitations
The host options button is always visible. However, the commands will not work if you are not the host.
If mute on join is configured in the Zoom meeting, you have to mute and unmute for the device to match up this Zoom setting.
