Webex App automatically connects with Board, Desk, and Room Series
To get the most out of your Cisco device, use it with the Webex app. Here are some easy tips to understand how they automatically connect.
When you're in a room with a Cisco Board, Desk, or Room Series device, the Webex app seamlessly connects to it. Once connected, you can easily initiate calls on the device and wirelessly share your screen using the app.
You can see if the app is connected, when the device name shows up on your app. Select the device name and Share on device to start sharing your desktop with others.


Turn on automatic connection on your app if it has been turned off. Go to Settings and select Devices. On the Desktop app, toggle on Automatically connect to devices. On your mobile app, toggle on Use Ultrasound or Use NFC.
When you turn off the app or leave the room, your app gets disconnected from the device. Disconnecting can take up to two minutes.
The app discovers devices by listening for an ultrasound signal, or by detecting nearby devices based on Wi-Fi information. The Wi-Fi discovery works if your administrator has enabled it.
The app, and connecting to a device, works with both Windows and Mac, and most Android and iOS devices.

For the automatic connection to work, you can only have one device that uses ultrasound in a room.
