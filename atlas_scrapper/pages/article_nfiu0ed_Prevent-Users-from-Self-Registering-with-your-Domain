Prevent Users from Self-Registering with your Domain
Webex is easy to try and to share, but you may want to prevent people from signing up for trial accounts with your email domain.
Disable Self-Registration and Sideboarding
We make it easy for users to try Webex for themselves, or to share it with others, simply by using their email addresses.
We also recognize that there are situations where you want more control of the user onboarding process, so we provide an option to prevent users from signing up if their email address is from one of your domains.
For a discussion of the potential problems with self-registration, see Ways to Add Users to your Control Hub Organization
Before you begin
You cannot prevent users from self-registering with your domain unless you have claimed your domain.
1
Sign in to Control Hub at https://admin.webex.com.
2
Go to Organization Settings and find the Self-Registration section.
The control is disabled if you have not claimed any domains.
3
Move the slider to disable self-registration.
Users will not be able to self-register if they use an email address like username@your-claimed-domain.org.
