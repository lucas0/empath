European Union data migration for Webex sites in Control Hub
With the new data center now operational in Frankfurt, we're allowing customers from the European Union (EU) to migrate their data from the data center in London to the one in Frankfurt.
Migrating your Webex site to the EU
With the launch of the new Frankfurt data center, we're allowing customers in the EU to migrate from the London data center to the one in Frankfurt. To help create an easy path for you to migrate your data, we've taken the following steps:
Showing you where your data is stored—With transparency as our guiding principle, you can now see which data centers that Webex sites are mapped to in Control Hub. You can use this knowledge to assess the business impact or concerns for your organization. You can view this information in Account > Data Locations.
Migrating your data to the new Frankfurt data center—Previously, the main data center for EU customers was in London, with a backup data center available in Amsterdam. Beginning in July 2021, the main data center for new EU customers will now be in Frankfurt, with the one in Amsterdam as a backup. Existing EU customers will have the option to migrate their data over to the data center in Frankfurt if they wish to.

  If you wish to opt out of the migration, you have three days before your scheduled migration date to do so. You can see when that date is and opt out in Control Hub. If you decide later that you want to migrate to the Frankfurt data center, you'll have a chance again during the next round of migrations, targeted for early 2022.
