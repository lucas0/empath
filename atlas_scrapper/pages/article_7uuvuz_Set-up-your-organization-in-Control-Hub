Set up your organization in Control Hub
If you're a new Webex customer, Control Hub can guide you through setting up your organization's environment, checking adoption status and trends, and making your environment more secure.
If you became a Webex customer after May 9, 2023, Control Hub can guide you through setup tasks such as deploying the services you purchased, adding users and licenses, applying policies through settings templates, configuring your organization, setting up Meetings, Messaging, Calling, and Contact Center, and adding devices.
You can also help your users get started with Webex by sharing a launch kit, visiting our Adoption Resources Library, and joining the Webex Community.
After you set up your environment, you can check to see how the adoption of Webex is going. Control Hub can also guide you through making your environment more secure.
