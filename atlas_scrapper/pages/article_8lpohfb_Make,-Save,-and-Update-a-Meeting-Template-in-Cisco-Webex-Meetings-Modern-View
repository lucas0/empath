Make, Save, and Update a Meeting Template in Cisco Webex Meetings Modern View
In Modern View, you can make and save a scheduler template to use later. For example, you can save a template that includes your whole team so that you donâ€™t have to add all of them each time. Or, you can save a template with the audio connection, recording, and password options you use the most often.
1
Select Schedule a Meeting to go to the Schedule a Meeting page.
2
Enter the meeting information. Follow the same steps as Schedule a Cisco Webex Meeting in Modern View.
3
Select Save as template.
4
In the Save as template window, enter a name in New template name. If you want to update an existing template, select the name of that template. Then select OK.

  Only site administrators can save edits to a standard template.
After you save or update a new template, it will be available in the Meeting templates drop-down.
