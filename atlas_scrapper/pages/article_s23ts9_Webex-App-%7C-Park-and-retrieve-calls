Webex App | Park and retrieve calls
If you're part of a call park group, you can park an ongoing call. When you park a call, the call gets assigned a parked number that's not your phone number. You can then use that parked number to retrieve the call from another device. Or you can share the number with people in a different department so that one of them can retrieve the call from their own device.
