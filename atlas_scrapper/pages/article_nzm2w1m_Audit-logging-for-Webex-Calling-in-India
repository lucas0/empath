Audit logging for Webex Calling in India
In this article
With audit logging, the configuration changes to India toll bypass settings get logged in a log file for auditing. The Webex Calling administrator can review the logs stored in Control Hub. Search for specific dates and narrow your results. The administrator can download the logs to a comma-separated values (CSV) file.
