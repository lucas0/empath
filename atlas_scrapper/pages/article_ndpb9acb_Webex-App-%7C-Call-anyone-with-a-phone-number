Webex App | Call anyone with a phone number
If your organization has configured your Webex App account to let you call other people's phone numbers, you can call anyone who has a phone number. When you call like this, itâ€™s just like making a regular phone call from any other type of phone. If you want to call your favorite restaurant to make your lunch order, call them right from the app, and place your order.
Desktop
iPhone and iPad
Android
Access to a dial pad is available if you're set up with a phone service such as Unified CM, Webex Calling, or Calling hosted by a Service Provider.
Go to , enter a phone number in the dial pad, and then choose whether you want to make it an Audio or Video call.
You can even place a call from your app header. Just click Search, meet, and call, enter the name, email address, or video address, and then press Enter to make the call.
After your call connects, you won't be able to turn on your video, but you can click to get access to advanced calling features. You can put your call on hold or transfer the person to someone else. With some configurations, you can also merge calls or start a conference call.

  If your administrator has enabled call security for your organization, you'll see at the top right of your calling window, letting you know that the call is secure.
