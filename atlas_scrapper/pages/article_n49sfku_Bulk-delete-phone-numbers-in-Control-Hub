Bulk delete phone numbers in Control Hub
As a customer administrator, you can delete phone numbers from an organization, in bulk, in Control Hub.
Before you begin
Only phone numbers that are unassigned can be bulk deleted.
If a number belongs to a block of numbers, it can’t be deleted unless all numbers in that block are unassigned.
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Services > Calling > Numbers.
2
Select the phone numbers you’d like to delete.
3
Click Delete from the top navigation menu.
Optionally, you can select the Delete option from Manage.
4
Confirm your deletion.
5
The bulk delete process starts and can be viewed in Task Manager.

  Numbers that aren’t able to be deleted will show as errors. Typical errors include:
Attempting to delete a number that is assigned to a user or service.
Attempting to delete a number that is part of a number range.To resolve a number range error, you must select the entire block of numbers in that range for deletion.
