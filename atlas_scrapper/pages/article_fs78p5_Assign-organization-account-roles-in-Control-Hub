Assign organization account roles in Control Hub
You can set up users in your organization with different administrator roles. Users can become full administrators, or a combination of support administrators, user and device administrators, device administrators, read-only administrators, or compliance officers. You can also see a list of all or specific administrators in Control Hub, including device administrators and compliance officers.

Managing roles in Control Hub
We recommend that you share administrative responsibilities within your organization. Even in small organizations, you should have more than one person holding the full administrator role, to ensure availability.
As a full administrator, you can assign various administrative roles to people in your organization. This means you can streamline responsibilities and share accountability for managing the organization.
For example, a compliance officer is privileged to access user-generated content as necessary for legal / compliance purposes. This is likely to be a different person than a support administrator, who can see meeting analytics and troubleshooting information.
This article describes how to manage administrative roles and lists the privileges associated with each role.
If you're managing multiple Webex organizations for your customers, refer to the administrator roles in Partner Hub article.
