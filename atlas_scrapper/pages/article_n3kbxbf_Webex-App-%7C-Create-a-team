Webex App | Create a team
In Webex App, teams help you keep everything organized by categorizing multiple spaces under a common theme. For example, you may have a team for a large project that includes cross-department members all working together on specific pieces of the project. When you're creating a team, you can also select an emoji and add it to the name.
