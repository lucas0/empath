Webex App | Moderate a space
Sometimes you may want to control who can get added to a space. If so, you can start moderating the space to prevent others from adding people to the space. When you moderate a space on a team, people in the team can see the space but they must ask a moderator to be added to the moderated space.

  Public spaces are not moderated. For more information about public spaces, see Webex App | Public spaces.
