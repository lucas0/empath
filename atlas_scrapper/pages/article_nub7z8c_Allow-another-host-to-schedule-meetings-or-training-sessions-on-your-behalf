Allow another host to schedule meetings or training sessions on your behalf
Allow another host on your Webex site to schedule meetings or training sessions for you. This feature is useful when you're unable to reach a computer or when you're too busy to do it yourself.
1
Sign in to User Hub.
2
Go to Settings > Meetings > Scheduling.
3
In the Scheduling permission box, type the email addresses of the hosts that you want to allow to schedule for you.
Separate multiple addresses with either a comma or semicolon.

  You can select a maximum of 20 hosts.

(Optional) To grant your delegates access to post meeting content, such as recordings, transcripts, highlights, and attendance reports, check Automatically share meeting content with my delegates.
Delegates receive an email after the meeting ends with a link to the meeting content, or they can go to the meeting content from User Hub. If a delegate schedules a meeting, the meeting content still gets shared to all delegates.
