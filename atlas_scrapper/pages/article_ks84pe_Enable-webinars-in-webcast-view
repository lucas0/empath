Enable webinars in webcast view
To reach larger audiences that join from a web browser, you can allow your Webex Webinars hosts to conduct their webinars in webcast view. If you prefer not to allow webinars in webcast view on your Webex site, you can turn them off.
Only plans that support 3000 or more users include webinars in webcast view. Webinars in webcast view are not available for Webex for Government.
