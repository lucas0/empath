Join or leave a breakout session
How attendees can join breakout sessions depends on how the host or cohost has set them up. As an attendee, if you're assigned to a breakout session, you can join it manually or automatically after the session starts. Alternately, the host or cohost can allow anyone to join any breakout session without having to be assigned to it.
As a host or cohost, you can join any breakout session to participate in the discussions or provide help.
This feature is supported on Webex Meetings and Webex Webinars. On Webex App, this feature is available on our Video Mesh-ready meeting platform.

  In webinars, only panelists can be assigned to breakout sessions. You cannot assign attendees. Once breakout sessions have started, attendees can choose which one they want to join.
