Invite people to your Webex Personal Room
You can easily host instant meetings in your Personal Room. You can also invite people to your Personal Room after a meeting has started.
When you invite people to your Personal Room, they can easily find your meetings since the link to your meeting location never changes.
If you're unable to host a meeting in your Personal Room, you can designate a cohost to take over the host role for you.
Invite people to your Personal Room:
Share your unique URL through an email message or instant message: You can find your Personal Room URL on your Home page on your Webex site.
From within your Personal Room, go to More options in the meeting controls, select Invite and Remind , and follow the prompts.
If you have the Webex integration to Microsoft Outlook in Webex Productivity Tools, invite people through Outlook:
In the Webex toolbar in the Outlook window, select Schedule Personal Room Meeting .
Enter the details for your meeting and then select Send .
