Webex App | Edit space settings
You can change a space picture from a round icon with the first letter of the space name, by uploading a picture for the space. Or, if you change the space name, the icon letter changes too. You can also add a cover image to the space, to add a personal touch.
You can edit any space settings except the General space.
But if you’re a member of a moderated space, then you can only view space settings and not edit them.
Supported Graphic Formats and Sizes
You can use lots of common graphic formats for your photo: .jpg, .png, .gif, or .bmp. The file has to be under 10 MB, though.
