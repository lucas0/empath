Bulk provisioning Webex Calling elements using CSV
Webex Calling leverages Comma Separated Value (CSV) files to quickly export and import provision-able elements to the cloud. By importing a file, the Webex Calling system either creates, updates, or deletes the associated elements based on the field values.
CSV uploads adhere to the following conventions:
Each line of the CSV file represents a record that consists of field values with a comma (,) between each field. To escape commas within fields, prefix the comma with a backslash (\), for example, a field with the value "Smith, Barney, and Weston" must be encoded as "Smith\, Barney\, and Weston".
The first row of the CSV is the header row with CSV data is the field names that specify the field order and the number of fields for all the subsequent data rows in the CSV. Rows with a different number of fields will be rejected with an error.
Any field left blank (not included) is ignored.
If you want to clear a setting, enter REMOVE in that column.
If a field is mandatory, then that field must be included for each record. If it is not included, then that record is flagged for error.
Certain fields are designated as identity (ID) fields (also known as an identify field). Identity fields canâ€™t be modified, and stay fixed for the life of that record. If you attempt to change an identity field, then more than likely, that record is flagged for error, as the system is unable to identify the record with an incorrect ID field.
CSV files support Unicode characters.
Only E.164 numbers are allowed for CSV import.

Some spreadsheet editors remove the + sign from cells when the CSV is opened. We suggest you use a text editor to make CSV updates. If you use a spreadsheet editor, make sure to set the cell format to text, and add back any + signs that were removed.
