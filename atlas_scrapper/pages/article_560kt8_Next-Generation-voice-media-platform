Next Generation voice media platform
The article helps you understand the availability of the Next Generation voice media platform in Webex Contact Center. (Next Generation media service is also referred to as Real Time Media Service (RTMS))
The voice media platform is the component in Webex Contact Center that terminates voice calls. Some of the functions of the media platform include:
Terminate inbound calls from the PSTN
Play prompts to a caller
Collect input from a caller
Add Agent or Supervisors to a call
Virtual Agent capabilities
When a new Webex Contact Center platform is provisioned, you are prompted sometimes to select the media platform you require. These options are:
Classic — provides all our existing media functions but, currently doesn't have new capabilities added to it. It is available for customers where our Next Generation platform may not provide certain services or integrations in a specific region of the world.
Next Generation — provides most existing media functions but not in all regions. Next Generation has new capabilities planned for our customers. These capabilities are not available in the Classic platform.
For a new deployment, your Webex A2Q contact center recommends which platform to select for your organization.

The Next Generation platform becomes the default option for all customers in the future and the Classic media service will be retired. All existing customers are moved to Next Generation media service as part of a platform update in the future. Webex customer support team contacts customers before applying the platform update to their service.
New features that the Next Generation media platform provides include:
Regional Media for global contact centers
Background Noise removal for Premium agents - Coming soon
WebRTC Agent capabilities - Coming Soon
Advanced Virtual Agent capabilities with Google Dialogflow CX

Cisco Calling Plan for Webex Calling
The table shows options for two calling integration types:
VPOP — This option doesn't provide a calling service for your deployment. A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) connection is made to a Webex data center either by a service provider or directly from your location through a session border controller (SBC) such as Cisco Cube. With this option, your agents answer calls using PSTN-connected endpoints or through an on-premise Private Branch Exchange (PBX) integration through a SIP connect to an SBC.
Webex Calling — This option provides a calling service to your organization. Calls are delivered to your contact center through one of the supported Webex Calling PSTN options, and your agents can be using Webex Calling endpoints or apps.
