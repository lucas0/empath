RoomOS 9 known and resolved issues
Here you can read what we have fixed in the latest releases of RoomOS 9. You can also find an overview of which issues we’re still working on and possible workarounds.
From January 2021 RoomOS 9.15 and later only supports DX, MX, and SX Series products. This change is automatic with the January 2021 software update. For Board, Desk, and Room Series, see Known and resolved issues for RoomOS 11 article .

RoomOS 9 December 2021 (RoomOS 9.15.9.10 4e2d9b9f6aa) release was rolled back due to possible crashes when network connection is unstable.

Known issues
If the device fails to get an IP address through DHCP when configuring 802.1x, the last configured IP address shows up as the IP address although the device has no network connection. At the same time, the Touch 10 controller and on-screen display home screens show a message about missing network.
When 802.1x is configured, the configuration isn’t applied immediately. Instead, the system tells that no network is connected until the WPA supplicant has been updated. It can take up to 30 seconds to see the change. Workaround: Wait for the 802.1x authorization to finish or make sure that 802.1x is configured correctly.
Limitations
Cloud-registered Webex devices have an internal 30 minute timeout setting, after which they will disconnect from a meeting if no participants have joined. It's not possible to override this behaviour, and the Control Hub setting 'Automatically end meetings if there is only one participant' does not impact it.
