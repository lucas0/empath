View upcoming meetings on User Hub
The upcoming meeting list gives you an at-a-glance look at your schedule to help you better manage your time.
From the Meetings section of your Webex site, you can view a list of your next four meetings, events, and training sessions. See the title, time, and host for the meeting. Shortly before the meeting, participants see a Join button. Meeting hosts have a Start button.
Clicking a meeting shows you the complete meeting details, including the meeting link, more ways to join, and a button to add the meeting to your calendar.
If you're the host, you also have the host key and buttons to copy the meeting details, edit the meeting, and cancel the meeting.
