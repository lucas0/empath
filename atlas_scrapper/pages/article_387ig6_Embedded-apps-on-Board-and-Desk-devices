Embedded apps on Board and Desk devices
The Webex embedded apps framework allows you to interact with a third party application within Webex.
The embedded apps framework lets you easily integrate your existing web applications into Cisco devices. During a meeting, you can share a third party application from Webex Meetings and open it on your device. Other participants can see and interact with the application that you're sharing.
Make sure that the web engine is turned on.

The default applications that are supported are Miro, Slido, and Mural.
1
Join a meeting on Webex Meetings and on your device.
2
Click on the Apps button and select an application.




3
Select Open together for the application to open on your device.


4
You can open the application in a larger view on the device by tapping the Maximize button. Tapping Panel view goes back to side view.




With the application opened in side view, you can tap the cross icon on the top right corner to close the application. It can still be accessed in the call controls.
