Set up a meeting zone on Board, Desk, and Room devices
With the Meeting Zone feature, you now have control over which part of the captured scene (meeting zone) is included in the video sent from the room.
You can easily configure the meeting zone using the touch interface. Support for configuring it through the API will be available in RoomOS September.
.
For spaces like open offices or glass-walled meeting rooms, this feature is particularly useful as it minimizes distractions caused by including people in the background during meetings. When someone stands outside the defined meeting zone, they won't be included in the automatic framing of the video. Only individuals within the meeting zone will be counted.
By enabling this feature, you can make sure that your meetings focus on the right people and minimize disruptions from the surrounding environment.

Note that Speakertrack 60 is not supported.
