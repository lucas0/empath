Webex CSV File Format Reference
Site administrators can create company-specific CSV files to use for importing and exporting users into your Webex site.
CSV File Format for Cisco Webex User Accounts
Before you import user account data in a CSV file, create a backup file of your existing user accounts by exporting the data. You only need to import data for the accounts that you're adding or updating.
All exports (report, user, contacts) are exported in Unicode tab-delimited text (UTF-16LE) format. All imports support CSV (for English data only) and Unicode tab-delimited text (for non-English data and mixed language data).
A CSV file must include column headings at the top of the file. When creating a CSV file using a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel, ensure that the column headings are in the first row of a spreadsheet. Column headings must appear exactly as specified in the Account-Information Fields section.
Some user account information is required, as specified in the Account-Information Fields section. Include all column headings for required fields.
We strongly recommend that you create a CSV file template. The template helps to ensure that your CSV file contains all required column headings, in their proper format.
The account-information fields in a CSV file aren't case-sensitive. Thus, you can type values in either uppercase or lowercase letters, or a combination of both. The values that appear in the user’s profile on your site appear as you enter them in the CSV file. To sign in to their accounts, users must type their default passwords exactly as you specify them in the CSV file.
See the Account-Information Fields section for information about how to format the user account information.
After you finish specifying the user account information, save the spreadsheet as a CSV file.
If you specify information for a user account incorrectly, Webex Site Administration can't create that account. Webex Site Administration generates a list of records for the accounts that it was unable to create, including the cause for each error. You can download a file containing these records to your computer, for reference or to correct the errors directly in that file.
Create a CSV File Template
When you export the CSV file, you get a baseline or template that you can use to add new users. Alternately, you can use the file to batch-edit multiple user accounts.
1
Sign in to Webex Site Administration and go to User Management > Import/Export Users.
2
On the Batch Import/Export Users page, select Export.
A message appears to confirm receipt of your request. You receive an email message when the export process is complete.
3
Click the link in the email message and open the exported file in a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel.
4
If you want to only add new user accounts, delete any account data that the exported file contains.
Deleting this data does not affect any existing accounts when you upload the CSV file to Webex Site Administration.

CSV File Format for Contacts
Before you import contact data in a CSV file, create a backup file of your contacts data, if any, by exporting the data.
All exports (report, user, contacts) are exported in Unicode tab-delimited text (UTF-16LE) format. All imports support CSV (for English data only) and Unicode tab-delimited text (for non-English data and mixed language data.)
A CSV file must include column headings at the top of the file. When creating a CSV file using a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel, ensure that the column headings are in the first row of a spreadsheet. Column headings must appear exactly as specified under Contact-Information Fields.
Some contact information is required, as specified under Contact-Information Fields. You must include all column headings for required fields. You need not include column headings for optional fields, for which you do not provide contact information.
To ensure that your CSV file contains all required column headings, in their proper format, Webex strongly recommends that you create a CSV file template.
The contact-information fields in a CSV file are not case-sensitive. Thus, you can type values in either uppercase or lowercase letters, or a combination of both. The values that appear in the contact's information on your site-such as the contact's name-will appear as you type them in the CSV file.
See Contact-Information Fields, for the correct format for contact information.
After you finish specifying contact information, ensure that you save the spreadsheet file as a CSV file.
When uploading a CSV file, Webex Site Administration displays a table containing the information that you specified in the file. Please review all information carefully, and verify its accuracy before you confirm that you want to upload the file.
If you specify any information for a contact incorrectly, Site Administration cannot create that contact. In this case, Webex Site Administration generates a list of records for the contacts that it was unable to create, including the cause for each error. You can download a file containing these records to your computer for reference or to correct the errors directly in that file.
If you correct the errors directly in the downloaded file, ensure that you delete the last column, labeled Comments, before you upload the file.
Alternately, you can edit contacts individually using Webex Site Administration. Or, you can contact your Webex account manager for assistance.
Create a CSV File Template for Contacts
When you export the CSV file, you get a baseline or template that you can use to add new contacts. Alternately, you can use the file to batch-edit multiple contacts. If no contacts currently exist on your site, manually add a least one contact to your site.
1
Sign in to Webex Site Administration and go to Manage Site > Company Addresses.
2
On the Company Address Book page, click Export.
3
Open the file containing the data that you exported in a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel.
4
If you want to only add new contacts, delete any contact data that the exported file contains.
Deleting this data does not affect the contacts when you upload the CSV file to Webex Site Administration.

If you are adding a new contact, do not provide any information in this column. Webex Site Administration generates this number once you upload the CSV file. Webex Site Administration requires this field to be empty to create a new contact.
If you are editing an existing contact, do not modify this number. If you modify the number for an existing contact, Webex Site Administration creates a new contact, using the data in that row. However, if required contact data—such as an email address—already exists for a contact on your site, Site Administration cannot create the new contact.

CSV File Format for Tracking Code Values
A CSV file must include column headings at the top of the file. When creating a CSV file using a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel, the column headings must be in the first row of a spreadsheet. Column headings must appear exactly as specified under Code-Value Information Fields.
Some tracking code information is required, as specified under Code-Value Information Fields. You must include all column headings, regardless of whether their information is optional, and format them exactly as specified.
The code-value information fields in a CSV file are not case-sensitive. Thus, you can type values in either upper- or lowercase letters, or a combination of both. The tracking code values appear on your site as they appear in the CSV file.
After you finish specifying code values, save the spreadsheet file as a CSV file, which as a .csv extension.
When uploading a CSV file, Webex Site Administration displays a table containing the information that you specified in the file. Review the information carefully, and verify its accuracy before you confirm that you want to upload the file.
If you specify any code values incorrectly, Webex Site Administration cannot add those values to the list. In this case, Site Administration generates a list of records for the values that it was unable to add, including the cause for each error. You can download a file containing these records to your computer for reference or to correct the errors directly in that file.
If you correct the errors directly in the file that Webex Site Administration creates for you, delete the last column, labeled Comments, before you upload the file to create the remaining code values.
Alternately, you can edit values individually in Webex Site Administration,on the Tracking Codes List page. Or, you can contact your Webex account manager for assistance.
Code-Value Information Fields
