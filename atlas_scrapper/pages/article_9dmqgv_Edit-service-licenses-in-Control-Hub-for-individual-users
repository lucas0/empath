If you assigned a Webex Meetings license, choose an account type to assign the user with for each Webex Meetings site, and click Save.

  You must have the Attendee account feature enabled for your Webex site to assign users as attendees. If you don't see the Attendee account column in the CSV file, then contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to enable this feature for your Webex site.
The attendee account type isn't available for users with the Webex Site Administrator role. If you want to assign these users with an attendee account, you must remove their administrative privileges for that Webex Meetings site.

  Immediately after adding a Calling license, if an error is received when selecting the user Calling settings, we recommend that you remove the Webex Calling license and then reassign the license to the user.
