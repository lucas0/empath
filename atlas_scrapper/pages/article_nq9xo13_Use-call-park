Use call park
You can use your phone to park a call. You can then retrieve the call either from your phone or another phone.
You can park an active call and later pick up the parked call from your phone or retrieve it from another phone, such as a phone at a coworkerâ€™s desk or in a conference room.
A parked call is monitored by your call control system so you won't forget about it. If the call remains parked for too long (typically 1 minute), you will receive an incoming call periodically to remind you to pick up the parked call. Then you can answer or ignore the call on your phone. If you don't answer the incoming call within a certain length of time (typically 5 minutes), it's routed to voicemail or another destination, as set by your administrator.
