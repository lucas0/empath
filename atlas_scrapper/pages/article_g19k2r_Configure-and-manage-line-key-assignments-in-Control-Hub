Configure and manage line key assignments in Control Hub
In this article
Overview for line key
Administrators can customize the Multi-Platform Phones (MPP) buttons layout by configuring Line Key Assignments in Control Hub.
Configure line key assignments in any of the following ways:
Template Format - Configure line key assignments on the organization, location, or device level where you can apply bundles of settings in bulk.
Layout Format - Configure line key assignments where you can apply the button customization on an individual device basis.
Once you configure the settings, you can sync the phones immediately or schedule a later time to sync and apply the settings.
Customer administrators benefit from the enhanced management capabilities for MPP devices, while users benefit from the ability to work with customized line keys.

End users cannot configure their device line key assignments.
Feature specifications and caveats for line key
Administrators define template settings and button layouts.
A template is a bundle of settings that are model-specific. Templates can be built and applied on an organization, location, or user-level and applied in bulk. Templates allow for uniform configuration to specific MPP devices. After a template is applied, an admin has the option of customizing the buttons for individual devices.
A template doesn’t provide customization for the button mapping on each device, but just defines the type of buttons the device will use.

Bulk application is not available for Key Expansion Modules (KEMs). You can only customize buttons on an individual KEM basis.
Configurable line key options include:
Primary line key - This is the user’s primary extension which can appear multiple times on the phone but the very first appearance is the user’s primary extension.
Shared Line key - This shows the appearance of other users on the owner’s phone.
Monitor keys - These keys are dedicated to User and Call Park monitoring. Monitor keys are configured from the top of the configured monitor list.
Speed Dial key - A speed dial label and value, these keys are configured by the administrator. Unlike other buttons on the template, the value is directly attached to the specified appearance of the line key.
Open keys - An open key will automatically take the configuration of a monitor button starting with the first open key. These buttons are also usable by the user to configure speed dial numbers on these keys.
Closed keys - Button not usable but reserved for future features.

The first button on a device must be the primary line.
Layout Specifications:
Can be applied on an individual device basis.
Can be configured for selected devices within an organization.
When you apply a layout it erases out any customized line key configuration.
