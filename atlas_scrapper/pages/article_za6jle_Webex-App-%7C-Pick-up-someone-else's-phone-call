Webex App | Pick up someone else's phone call
Help someone out with their incoming calls. When your administrator makes you a member of a pickup group, you can hear or see when someone on your team gets a call. If your coworker is busy, answer their call for them. How you pick up that call depends on the calling service you're set up with: Webex Calling, Calling Hosted by a Service Provider, or Unified CM.
If you're not sure what you've been set up with, check out Find Out What Calling Service You Have.
