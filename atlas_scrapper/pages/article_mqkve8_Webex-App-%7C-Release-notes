Webex App | Release notes
We’re constantly working to improve your experience using Webex App. Check back often to see the latest information about any issues we’ve solved or updates we’ve made.
We support the latest version of the Webex App and the versions that are available to administrators in Control Hub (see Product update controls for Webex App desktop versions)
For the latest information about new features, check out Webex App | What’s New.
We report open and resolved customer-found bugs of severity 1 to 3. When an update does not include customer-found bugs, there will not be a Resolved Bugs list shown for that update.
