Interact with the API of Board, Desk, and Room Devices over WebSocket
WebSocket is a protocol that enables two-way communication between a client and the API of the board, desk or room device. You use JSON-RPC objects to convey API commands over the WebSocket.
These configurations are available both from the web interface of the device and in the API. Read the Advanced Settings article for more information on how to access the web interface and use the API.
When the web interface of the device is opened, configure NetworkServices > WebSocket to FollowHTTPService. Because WebSocket builds on HTTP, set up NetworkServices > HTTP > Mode to HTTP+HTTPS or HTTPS.
Read the xAPI over WebSocket Guide for more details on how to set up the WebSocket, and how to use JSON-RPC objects to convey API commands.
Refer to the API Reference Guide for a complete description of the xAPI itself.
