Webex App | Remove someone from a meeting
You might need to remove someone from a meeting if they've joined or been added to the meeting accidentally, or if they're just not needed in the meeting.
Your options to remove someone from a meeting depend on the type of meeting you've joined from Webex App.
Classic meetings associated with a space
When you remove someone who belongs to the space, you also remove them from the space. When you remove someone from a space, the person is notified that they've been removed from the space. They'll no longer receive notifications, but their content remains visible, based on your companyâ€™s data retention policy.
Webex standard meetings, Webex Personal Room meetings, and enhanced meetings assocated with a space
As a host, you can remove cohosts and attendees from your meeting. If you're a cohost, you can only remove attendees, not other cohosts. When you remove someone from a meeting, the person is notified that they've been removed from the meeting.
Windows, Mac
iPhone and iPad, Android

Click Expel to remove someone from a Webex scheduled meeting, a Webex Personal Room meeting, or an enhanced meeting associated with a space.
Click Remove from meeting from a classic meeting associated with a space.
