Enable Remember Me for Users in Webex Control Hub
Are your users tired of having to enter their email addresses each time they sign in to a Webex site? Enable the Remember Me setting in Webex Control Hub so that Webex remembers your users for a configurable period.
This setting applies to all users in your organization.
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Settings and scroll down to the Authentication section.
2
Toggle the switch under Remember Me Controls to on.
3
Set the number of days before users have to reenter their email address.
The browser sets a cookie, containing the hashed email address, to expire at the end of the configured period.

  Users can clear their Webex browser cookies if they want to sign in with a different email address.
