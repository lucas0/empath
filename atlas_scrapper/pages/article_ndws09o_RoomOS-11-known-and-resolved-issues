Known issues
After upgrading a device to RoomOS 11, Room Navigator may lose connection to the device. For more details, see the field notice.
Display-port over USB-C not working on Desk and Desk Mini with Lenovo X1 computers.
Workaround: Download 31.0.101.4091 or earlier from https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/726609/762922/intel-arc-iris-xe-graphics-whql-windows.html and execute program. Tick off "Execute a clean installation" and allow forcing of old driver version. Then reboot."
We made some improvements to the display identity on our devices. This may cause some laptops to identify the display differently and change display settings. Changing the display settings back on the laptop should address this and will be a one time occurrence.
Room Navigator may hang when booting up. To fix this, you need to factory reset the Room Navigator. Remove the foot and use a paper clip (or similar) to press and hold the recessed reset button until the screen turns black (approximately 10 seconds). Then release the button.
In Companion Mode, both the Webex Board and Touch 10 notify that the board will go into standby mode and clean the board. However it’s only possible to stop the clean-up from the Webex Board. Tapping the Touch 10 won’t stop the board from going into standby.
If the device fails to get an IP address through DHCP when configuring 802.1x, the last configured IP address shows up as the IP address although the device has no network connection. At the same time, the Touch 10 controller and on-screen display home screens show a message about missing network.
When 802.1x is configured, the configuration isn’t applied immediately. Instead, the system tells that no network is connected until the WPA supplicant has been updated. It can take up to 30 seconds to see the change. Workaround: Wait for the 802.1x authorization to finish or make sure that 802.1x is configured correctly.
Limitations
Brightness controller is shown on Room Navigator only if the connected displays allow brightness adjustment.
Cloud-registered Webex devices have an internal 30 minute timeout setting, after which they will disconnect from a meeting if no participants have joined. It's not possible to override this behavior, and the Control Hub setting 'Automatically end meetings if there is only one participant' does not impact it.
The following features are not supported on RoomOS 11: Shared line remote hold/resume/barge, snap to whiteboard, and facility service.
