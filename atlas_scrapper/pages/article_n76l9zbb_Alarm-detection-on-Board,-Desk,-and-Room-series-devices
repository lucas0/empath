Alarm detection on Board, Desk, and Room series devices
Using macros and third-party integrations, your Board, Desk, or Room device can detect an external alarm and trigger a status change in the xAPI.
Enabling alarm detection allows the device to recognize the audio signal of a fire alarm. Then, if an alarm is detected, it triggers a message in the xAPI. You can integrate a third-party application and program it to display the alarm on the device's screen, when a signal is detected.
IMPORTANT
The alarm detection feature supports T3 alarms only, which is the industry-standard alarm pattern in the United States.
It is not guaranteed that your device will detect an alarm. For example purposes only: low microphone levels will block detection. Therefore, you should not rely on this feature to raise awareness of an alarm and it does not replace any other safety and security measures and documentation.
Enable alarm detection
Alarm detection is disabled by default. To configure a device to detect an external alarm, go tho the device's web interface (read the Advanced Settings article for more information on how to access it) and select Settings from the menu on the left. Under Configurations, choose the following: .
RoomAnalytics > T3AlarmDetection > Mode to On
RoomAnalytics > T3AlarmDetection > TimeOut to any number of seconds between 5 and 60.

Alternatively, you can set these configurations in the device's API. Detailed information about each setting is available in the Cisco Board, Desk, and Room Series API Reference Guide.
Once enabled, if the system detects an alarm the xStatus RoomAnalytics T3AlarmDetected will switch from False to True. The status switches back to False when no alarm has been detected for the number of seconds defined as the timeout.
