Select a camera mode on Board, Desk, and Room Series
You can select a camera mode that ensures the best view for your meeting and device. The camera can switch from one speaker to the next, automatically adjust so that you are always centered, group participants together, or, you can choose to adjust it manually.
By selecting an automatic camera mode you'll get the best view for your device and meeting, without having to manually control the cameras yourself during meetings. You can change camera modes whether you're in a call or not.
Depending on the device you're using, there are a few different modes to choose from:
Group. The camera will adjust to show everyone.
Frames. The camera will zoom and show people individually or in smaller groups. Read this article for information and examples about how Frames mode works.
Speaker. The camera will follow the person speaking. The maximum distance for speaker tracking to work is 7.5 meters.
Best view. The camera will adjust automatically so you are always in the center of the frame.
Manual. Adjust the camera yourself.
Custom preset modes may also be available, if any have been defined. Read this article about camera presets.

Which modes are available to you can also depend on configurations your administrator has set.
