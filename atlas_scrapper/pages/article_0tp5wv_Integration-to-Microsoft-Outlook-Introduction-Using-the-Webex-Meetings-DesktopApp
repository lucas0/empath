Webex Meetings Integration to Microsoft Outlook
The integration to Microsoft Outlook is part of the Cisco Webex Meetings desktop app, and gives you an easy way to schedule, start, and join meetings from Microsoft Outlook.
Your site administrator may have installed the Cisco Webex Meetings desktop app for you. If not, you can download it from your Webex site. See Install and Set Up the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App.
Meeting invitees aren't required to use Outlook to join meetings that you schedule in Outlook and only need a Webex account if the meeting is restricted to Webex users on your site.
