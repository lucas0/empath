Charge your Bang & Olufsen Cisco 980

Use the included USB-C cable to charge your B&O Cisco 980. It takes about 2.5 hours to fully charge the headset. As your headset charges, the right LED slowly pulses to show the battery status. When your headset is fully charged, the power LED changes from pulsing green to solid green.
