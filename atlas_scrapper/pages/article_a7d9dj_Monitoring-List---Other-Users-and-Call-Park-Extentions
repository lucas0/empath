Monitoring List - Other Users and Call Park Extentions
You can allow someone to see the line status of a specific person's phone from the additional line keys on their own phone. Users can also quickly dial a monitored phone simply by pressing the associated line key on their desk phone. You can also enable users to monitor call park extensions, and see if any calls are parked on them.
The maximum number of monitored lines is 50 but you should consider bandwidth. The maximum may also be determined by the number of line buttons on the user's phone.

The monitoring service only works with a user's primary device.
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Users, and select the user you want to modify.
2
Select Calling, go to Between-user Permissions section, select Monitoring.
3
Choose from the following:
Add Monitored Line
Add Call Park Extension
A virtual line can also be included in the Add Monitored Line list for user monitoring.
4
Choose whether you want this user to be notified about parked calls, search for the person or call park extension to be monitored, and then click Save.

  The monitored lines list in Control Hub corresponds with the order of monitored lines that show on the userâ€™s device. You can re-order the list of monitored lines at anytime.

  The name that appears for the monitored line is the name entered in the user, workspace and virtual line's Caller ID First Name and Last Name fields.
