Enable or Disable Webex Tabs
The Apps page in Control Hub is where you control whether users can add tabs for apps or web links.
Tabs are on by default, so users can add links or apps to tabs in Webex. If you disable tabs, you prevent all users from adding tabs in Webex, and they stop seeing existing tabs. Webex restores them if you re-enable the global control.
1
Sign in to https://admin.webex.com, and open Apps.
2
Enable Tabs, (if it is not already on).
