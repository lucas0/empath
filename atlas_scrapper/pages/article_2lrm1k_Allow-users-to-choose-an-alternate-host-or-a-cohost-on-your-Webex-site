Allow users to choose an alternate host or a cohost on your Webex site
As an administrator, you can allow hosts to designate a cohost or an alternate host in Webex Meetings, Webex Webinars, and Webex Events (classic). Hosts can then have that person or a video system user start the meeting in their place if they’re running late or can’t attend.

  Only Webex host account holders on your site can be designated as a cohost or alternate host. Meetings and Webinars use the cohost role, while Events (classic) continues to use the alternate host role. For more information, see Cohosts.
