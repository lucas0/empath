View the maximum participant limits for your Webex site
As a site administrator, you can view your participant or attendee limits for each service on your Webex site.
The following table lists the maximum participant and attendee limits; actual limits depend on your purchased license capacity. To view the actual limits for your Webex site, use Site Administration or Control Hub. Site Administration doesn't display participant limits for Webinars 5000 and above; Control Hub does.

  Webex video platform version 1.0 allows for 25 more participants, past the stated participant limit. Video platform version 2.0 doesn't exceed the stated participant limit.
