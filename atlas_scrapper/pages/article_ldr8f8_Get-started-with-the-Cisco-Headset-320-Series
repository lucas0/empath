Get started with the Cisco Headset 320 Series
The Cisco Headset 320 Series is a series of wired headsets designed for easy plug-and-play functionality with a wide variety of call devices and soft clients.
The Cisco Headset 320 Series is a set of headsets designed for seamless integration with Cisco software and devices. The Cisco Headset 321 features a single earpiece for extended use and comfort, while the Cisco Headset 322 features a full stereo experience for busy workplaces. Both headsets offer plug-and-play integration with Webex App, Webex Meetings, Cisco IP Phones, Cisco Jabber, and Cisco Room Devices. Both headsets are also available with an RJ9 connector for use on Cisco IP Phones without a USB port.
The Cisco Headset 320 Series is also the first Cisco headset to feature the Webex button. Use the Webex button to bring the app window to the top of your desktop screen or join upcoming meetings.
The 320 Series controller LED notifies you whenever you have a meeting or call you can join. Simply press the Webex button to enter an upcoming meeting. If you have two meetings, you need to select the meeting you want to join.
The 320 Series is also available in a version certified for use with Microsoft Teams. The Teams version of the headset features the same plug-and-play integration with Cisco devices including Cisco IP Phones and Room Devices. See Make calls with your Cisco Headset 320 Series for complete Microsoft Teams call control information.
