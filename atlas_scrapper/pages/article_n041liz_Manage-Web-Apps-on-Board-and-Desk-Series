Manage Web Apps on Board and Desk Series
You can add, delete, and edit web apps directly from the settings menu on your device.

You can also edit and delete apps that are already in your list.
Any web apps configured on Control Hub or in the UI extension editor are visible in the web apps list under Externally Managed Web Apps, but it is not possible to edit or delete them from the device.
Adding web apps isn't possible on DX70 and DX80 devices.
To add a web app from the settings menu:
1
Tap the button or swipe from the right side of your device's screen to open the control panel. Then tap Device settings.
2
Scroll to and select Manage Web Apps.
3
Tap Add Web App and in the next screen, enter the name and URL. If you want your app to show up in the call controls as well as the home screen, toggle on the setting.

4
Tap the checkmark in the right corner to finish.
