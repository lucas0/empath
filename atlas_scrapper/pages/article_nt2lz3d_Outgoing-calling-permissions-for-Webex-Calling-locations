Outgoing calling permissions for Webex Calling locations
In this article
You can determine the types of calls that users and places at a location are allowed to make.
Outgoing calling permissions
You can define the default calling permission for each call type at a location. For example, you can use the calling permission Block to keep users from making National calls in the San Jose location.
Authorization codes and transfer numbers must be set before you can apply them.
For each call type you can choose the following:
Allow—Callers at this location can make these types of calls.
Block—Callers at this location can’t make these types of calls.
Require Authorization Code—Callers must enter the authorization code that you set before placing an outgoing call. You can't have more than 100 authorization codes for an outbound calling plan.
Transfer to number 1, 2, or 3—If you select this, then these types of calls are transferred automatically to the number you choose.
