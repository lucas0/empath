Use Board and Desk Series with Webex spaces
You can work together and communicate with people in an existing Webex App space using a Board or Desk device. When you link your app to the device, you can easily call everyone in the space, create interactive whiteboards, and view and annotate to shared files in that space.
Your Board and Desk device work as a physical extension to your Webex App. When the app, either mobile or desktop, is connected to the device, you can collaborate with others in your Webex space from the device. Call your colleagues, view the files that have been shared, and continue working on the whiteboards you have created in your last meeting. Read this article for more details on how to connect the Webex App to your device.
This article applies to Board and Desk series devices in either personal or shared mode, and to DX 70 and DX 80 in shared mode only.
