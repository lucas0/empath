Known issues
Occasionally, when users try to start an instant meeting from a space that was created a while ago, they see the error, We can't connect your call.
Workaround: Try starting the instant meeting again.
On desktop, the numeric meeting password that's required to join an instant meeting from a video system isn't shown anywhere in the meeting information that appears in the meetings list, spaces list, or meeting information.
Workaround: In Webex App, click Connect to a device and then join the meeting.
If you have full-featured meetings or you're not a member of the space, you can view but not edit a whiteboard that is shared in a meeting associated with a space.
Intermittently, when you schedule a meeting associated with a space, it can take a while for the meeting to appear in the space.
Things to note
Meetings and the Meet button are unavailable
If you don't have a Webex license, Meetings and the Meet button are dimmed in spaces. When the Basic meetings license feature is available and the license is assigned to users, you'll get improved meetings associated with a space.
If you don't have your Personal Room set up, a default Webex site is not enabled. This also results in Meetings and the Meet button being dimmed in spaces. Make sure that your Personal Room is set up and your default Webex site is selected under Preferences.
In full-featured meetings, you send messages using the Chat panel instead of the Messages panel. Messages don't get added to the space associated with the meeting but they're available in the meeting recording.
