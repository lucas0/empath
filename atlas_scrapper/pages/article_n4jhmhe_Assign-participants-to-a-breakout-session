Assign participants to a breakout session
As a host or cohost, you can choose which participants you want in each session if you assigned participants manually instead of automatically when you created the breakout sessions. If participants join the meeting late, you can assign them to a breakout session after the sessions have started.
This feature is supported on Webex Meetings and Webex Webinars. On Webex App, this feature is available on our Video Mesh-ready meeting platform.

  In webinars, only panelists can be assigned to breakout sessions. You cannot assign attendees. Once breakout sessions have started, attendees can choose which one they want to join.
The number of participants in a breakout session is limited by the meeting capacity of your plan. For example, for plans that allow 1,000 people, you can have up to 100 breakout sessions with up to 10 people in each, 20 sessions with 50 people in each, and so on.
Participants who aren't assigned to breakout sessions remain in the main meeting when the breakout sessions start.
