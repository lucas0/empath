Manage a webinar series
A webinar series allows people to register for multiple Webex Webinars at once. Hosts can create a webinar series, and can add contributors to the series. Both hosts and contributors can add webinars they own to the series, as well as remove webinars they own from the series.
All webinars in a series use the same registration form. Registration approval is managed by the webinar host.
