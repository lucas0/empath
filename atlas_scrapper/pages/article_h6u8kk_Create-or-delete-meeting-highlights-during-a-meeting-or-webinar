Create or delete meeting highlights during a meeting or webinar
Meeting and webinar hosts and participants can capture key points during a meeting or webinar as highlights using Webex Assistant for Meetings. Highlights are short notes that can be shared and followed up on later. After the meeting or webinar ends, highlights are emailed to the host and are available to them on their Webex site. Hosts can share the highlights with anyone who has an account on their Webex site and email selected highlights to others.
Webex Assistant is available in Meetings and Webex Webinars (not available for webinars in webcast view).
Beginning with the 41.5 update, Webex Webinars supports Webex Assistant.
In addition to Meetings and Webinars, with the 41.7 update, Webex Assistant is also available for the Webex App. Meetings started or joined from a space don't support Webex Assistant.
Webex for Government doesn't support Webex Assistant.
This feature requires Cisco Webex video platform version 2.0 with joining meetings from video systems enabled. To find out which version youâ€™re using, see Find your Webex Meetings version number.
