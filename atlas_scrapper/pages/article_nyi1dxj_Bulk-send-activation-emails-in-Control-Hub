Bulk send activation emails in Control Hub
If you have multiple users who havenâ€™t activated their accounts yet, you can save time by sending them all activation emails with the click of a button.
Sending activation emails this way sends out the emails again for all users who have the Not Verified or Verified status. If users are on Cisco's suppression list, this process also clears them from the list to make sure that they receive the emails.
