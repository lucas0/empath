Webex App | Link a Microsoft OneDrive or SharePoint Online folder to a space
If everyone in a space is working together on files in a Microsoft OneDrive or SharePoint Online folder, you can link the space to that folder. Everyone can then access the files in the linked folder directly from the Webex App space.

  Your administrator must configure this option before you can use linked folders. If you subscribe to Webex from your Service Provider, please contact your Service Provider’s customer support team to enable the configuration.

In the space, click Content, and then select + Folder from Microsoft.
In the Webex dialog, select Continue.
If you haven’t already connected your Microsoft account, you’ll be prompted to do so. Select OK once your account is connected.
You can then navigate through your connected Microsoft folders and choose which ones you’d like to add to the space. When you’ve found the folder you want, click Select.
Choose whether you want to set the folder as the default file location for the space and then select Done.

  The Set as default file location for space setting is only available if your administrator has set it up. If you don't see the option, then all files shared into the space are automatically uploaded to the linked folder.
You can now browse files in your Microsoft OneDrive or SharePoint folder directly within Webex.

  Depending upon your permissions, you’ll have access to OneDrive or SharePoint file actions from the embedded file browser including uploading, downloading, sharing, deleting, etc.
You can choose to switch to a basic view of the folder, view details about the folder or remove the folder from the space. In addition, you can undock the embedded browser from Webex using the Expand button.
