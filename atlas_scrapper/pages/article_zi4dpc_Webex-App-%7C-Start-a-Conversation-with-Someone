Webex App | Start a Conversation with Someone
When you send a direct message to a person for the first time, you create a conversation just between the two of you. The next time you message that person, your conversation picks up right where you've left it. Your messages can include a maximum of 5400 characters. (For comparison, this paragraph has about 340 characters!)
