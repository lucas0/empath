Webex App | Filter your spaces and content
Use the filters to find the messages and spaces that matter most to you, such as unread spaces, conversations with another person, or messages where someone has @mentioned you.
Desktop
iPhone and iPad
Android
Web
Click to view all the available filters. Then, select a filter to show just the messages or spaces you want to see.
If you select the Unread or Notifications filters, you can click to refresh your view and clear out messages after you've read them.
To return to your Spaces list, or to get out of a specific filter, click and select Show full list.

  Your upcoming and ongoing meetings are always visible at the top of the spaces list, regardless of any space filters you've set. However, upcoming and ongoing meetings are not visible at the top of the spaces list, when message filters, such as @ Mentions or Flags are selected.

  When you're using Notifications, Hidden, Unread and Drafts filters, click the icons to return to the filter list, or click to return to your spaces list:
