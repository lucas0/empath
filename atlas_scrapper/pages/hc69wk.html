Silence incoming calls to your phone in the Calling User Portal
If you're busy and don't want to be disturbed, you can silence incoming calls with the do not disturb feature. When enabled, callers hear the busy treatment. You can also enable a ring reminder to play a brief tone on your desktop phone when you receive an incoming call while on do not disturb.
1
Go to https://settings.webex.com and select Webex Calling.
2
From the Calling User Portal, click Call Settings.
3
Toggle on Do Not Disturb.
4
Check Use ring reminder, to be notified by a sound when a call comes in.
5
Click Save.
What to do next
If you'd like calls to go directly to voicemail, when do not disturb is enabled, you must enable the When busy treatment in the Voicemail Settings area of the Calling User Portal. For more information on how to configure voicemail settings, see Configure your voicemail settings in the calling user portal.
