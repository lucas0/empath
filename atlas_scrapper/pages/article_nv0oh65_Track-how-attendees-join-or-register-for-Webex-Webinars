Track how attendees join or register for Webex Webinars
As a host, you may have vendors or contacts forward the webinar email invitation to attendees. You can assign a source ID to each vendor or contact, then measure the effectiveness of your marketing efforts by tracking the sources from which attendees join or register for your webinars.
The source ID is captured when an attendee selects the URL link in an email message from a vendor who has been assigned a source ID.
After a webinar is complete, the host can generate an attendance or registration report showing each attendee's source ID.
You can add up to 50 invitation sources to a webinar.
1
After you schedule your webinar, click Add in the Invitation sources section.
2
Under Contact for invitation source, add the email address of the vendor or contact. This is who will forward your email messages to attendees.
3
Under Source ID, enter the source ID for this vendor or contact.
You can use any combination of letters, numbers, or special characters for the source ID.
4
Click Send invitation to contact.
The email address and source ID appear in the Previous source IDs list so you can copy them to future webinars after you schedule them.
5
After you add all your Source IDs, click Close.
Add more source IDs later by selecting your webinar and selecting Edit under Invitation sources.
