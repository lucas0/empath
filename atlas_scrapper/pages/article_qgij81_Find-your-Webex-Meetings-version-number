Find your Webex Meetings version number
Knowing your Webex version number helps you locate information you need about the Webex features and functions available to you.
From your User Hub:
Select Downloads, then hover over the information icon next to Version information.
The Page version represents what you see on User Hub
The Desktop app version represents what you see in your meetings.
Customers who choose to stay locked down to a specific desktop app version still see changes User Hub as product updates are released.
During a meeting, webinar, event, or training session:
Select Help > About.

  You can't access version information during a Webex Support session.
The version (or client version) is the same as the desktop app version and represents what you see in your meetings.
