Webex App | Upgrade your Cisco headset to the latest release
Keep your Cisco Headset 320 Series, Cisco Headset 500 Series, Cisco Headset 720 Series, or Cisco Headset 730 up to date with Webex App for Windows or Mac. We regularly update the headset firmware and add and improve features.
Webex App only supports the most recent Cisco headset firmware version. When you connect your headset, Webex App checks the firmware version and notifies you if there is a new firmware version to install. After the upgrade, the app notifies you that the upgrade is complete. the app won't begin the upgrade process if your headset is already upgrading through another Cisco client.

  Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) administrators can restrict headset upgrades to Unified CM sources. Check with your administrator if you aren't able to upgrade your headset through Webex App.
