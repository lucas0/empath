Sign in and book your Webex device with Hot desking
Learn how to sign in and book your Webex desk device for your workday.
If you share a workspace with your coworkers, then you may be able to sign in and book your device with Hot desking.
Hot desking gives you the benefits of a personal meeting device, including meeting notifications five minutes before the start time. Notifications originate from your personal calendar. You join your meetings with One Button to Push.
Hot desking includes the standard Webex meeting features, such as a personal whiteboard. You can access your personal meeting room from Webex, and you get host controls for meetings that you moderate.
If you want a hands-free approach, Hot desking is compatible with a personalized Webex Assistant for Devices. Try it with phrases such as "Join my personal meeting room."
If you don't book your device, then you can use it as a shared device.

  Hot desking requires an Internet connection. But you can experience network connectivity issues occasionally. To resolve this issue, unplug the network cable, wait a few minutes, and plug it back in to your device.
