View a device's history in Control Hub
Device history allows you to quickly check what has happened on the device. Details on changes to configurations, macros, web apps, and software versions help you when you want to see what has been changed and when you have to troubleshoot a device.
In the customer view on admin.webex.com, go to Devices. Select a device and click the History tab on the device details page.


On this page you can see what changes have been made to:
Configurations
Macros
Web apps (only available on Board and Desk Series devices)
Software versions
You can filter the results by selecting one or more of the available categories and by whether the change was made by the device or an administrator. You can change the date range in the calendar filter. The maximum date range is 30 days.
Select one of the results to see more details on the changes that have been made on the device.


In the summary and details, you can see what was changed, who made the change, and when and where that change was made.
