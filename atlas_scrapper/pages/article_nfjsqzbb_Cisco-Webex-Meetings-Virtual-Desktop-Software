Cisco Webex Meetings Virtual Desktop Software
Audio and video for meetings requires significant bandwidth, and can cause a bottleneck going through the data center. Cisco Webex Meetings Virtual Desktop Software provides an enhanced experience in virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) environments. The VDI software consists of the Webex Meetings app on the hosted virtual desktops (HVD) and the plugin on the thin clients. The software routes audio and video streams between the thin client and Webex Meetings cloud, without going through the HVD in the datacenter.
Overview
The Webex Meetings Virtual Desktop Software uses the same Webex Meetings Desktop App as used in non-VDI environments.
Audio and video traverse between the thin client and the Webex cloud, with video up to 720p resolution.
Easy deployment for Cloud meetings:
Install the Webex Meetings Desktop App on the hosted virtual desktops and the agent plugin on the thin clients.
You don't require infrastructure, such as Cisco Unified Communications Manager or Cisco Expressway.
Webex Meetings Virtual Desktop Software is available for Citrix XenDesktop, Citrix XenApp with Desktop Publishing, and VMware.
