Control Hub application status alarm definitions
Table 1. Threshold legend
Threshold value
Definition
0
Notification is triggered even for a single occurrence of the event.
N/A
There’s no significance for threshold here. All such events will be notified. (Example: Insufficient Licenses, Unified CM Service failure and so on)
Specific numbers like 10/60/90
Threshold value set for the notification to be triggered.

We monitor ungraceful shut down notifications on Dedicated Instance applications and will automatically clear the notifications after validating the applications. A TAC case isn’t required to address these notifications.
