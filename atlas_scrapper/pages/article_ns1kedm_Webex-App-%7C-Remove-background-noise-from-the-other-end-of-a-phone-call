Webex App | Remove background noise from the other end of a phone call
Have you ever been on a call with someone and you're having a hard time hearing them because they're in a noisy environment? Wish you could suppress their background noise? Now you can hear them loud and clear by turning on noise removal. Just make sure you're in a phone call with someone who doesn't have Webex App.
During a call, click in the header of your app.

  The first time you turn noise removal on, a popup displays, explaining what noise removal is and how it works.
Here are the different symbols you may see in the header and what they mean:
—no noise detected
—noise detected
—background noise removed
