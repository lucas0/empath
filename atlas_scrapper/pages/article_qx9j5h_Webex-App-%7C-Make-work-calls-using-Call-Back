Webex App | Make work calls using Call Back
Call Back lets you make a call using another number like a local land line or your mobile, so you can avoid using the internet or racking up costs from making a long-distance call. Your work number gets used as the caller ID so people can easily identify you.
Before you begin
Call back works by calling the number you've set up for Single Number Reach. So, you first need to add the number you want to use for call back as a Single Number Reach number. You can do this on the desktop app or the user portal.
1
From your mobile app, tap your profile picture, go to Settings, tap Calling, then tap Manage My Numbers and enable your call back number.
2
Tap in the top left corner and then select that same number from the list.
3
Make your call from Webex App.
4
When your call back number starts to ring, answer the call.
Your phone then rings the person you're trying to reach.
