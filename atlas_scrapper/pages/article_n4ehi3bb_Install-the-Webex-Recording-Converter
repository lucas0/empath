Install the Webex Recording Converter
You can use the Webex Recording Converter to convert your ARF format recordings to MP4 format. The converter is available only for Windows users.
The first time that you download an ARF recording from your Webex site, you are prompted to download and install the Webex Recording Converter to play the recording. However, if you've received a link to a Webex recording, you can select the link to stream and view the recording without downloading the Webex Recording Converter. If you don't have a converter yet, you can use the below steps to download it from your Webex site.
