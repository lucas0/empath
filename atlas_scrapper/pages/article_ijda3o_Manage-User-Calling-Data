Manage User Calling Data
In this article
You can bulk manage user calling data with bulk inserts or updates for user features. Administrators can import or export features with a CSV file.
Overview
If you have numerous user calling data to add, the Bulk manage user calling data option is convenient, and the CSV support reduces effort for deployment and migration.

Exporting more than 1000 records export the data in a zip file format. The zip file contains a single CSV with all the data and multiple files less than 1000 records. You can import data which is less than 1000 records to CSV, as importing is limited to 1000 records. The files less than 1000 records are generated that further allow administrators to quickly import any updates.
Every user calling data created in Control Hub requires populating a wizard with many parameters and the CSV support streamlines the process.
The below functionalities are some of the features being supported:
Monitoring
Push to Talk
Receptionist Client
Outbound Calling Auth Codes
