Search for keywords across all Webex meetings and webinar
Make better use of your Webex Assistant for Meetings transcripts by finding that exact place in the meeting or webinar or across multiple meetings or webinars where something was discussed.
You can use the search bar at the top of the page to search your meetings, webinars, recordings, and transcripts to find an important moment in a meeting or webinar. You can then play just the audio of that moment in the meeting or webinar or view the meeting or webinar details.
If a transcript wasn't created for the meeting or webinar or if the meeting or webinar occurred before Webex Assistant was enabled on your Webex site, the keyword is only found if it was used in the meeting or webinar title.
