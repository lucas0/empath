July 21, 2023
Beginning September 4, 2023, we'll start phasing out support of Basic and Advanced meetings associated with a space (Classic meetings associated with a space).
In October 2022, we released a new feature for meetings in spaces called Improved Meetings Associated with a Space. Unless you have a dependency on static meeting links or you use our SDKs, you should now have improved meetings associated with a space. If you haven't yet migrated, we'll work with you over the next few weeks.
We’ve compiled a list of customers who are impacted by static meeting links or who use our SDKs. Those customers will still have access to their Basic and Advanced meeting links until a solution is available in Improved Meetings Associated with a Space.
If you purchase Webex through a Service Provider this announcement does not apply to you. Your Service Provider will be communicating to you the details and timing of the move to Improved Meetings Associated with a Space. Please contact your Service Provider directly with questions.
This doesn't apply to Webex for Government.
