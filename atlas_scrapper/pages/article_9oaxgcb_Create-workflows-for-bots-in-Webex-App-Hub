Create workflows for bots in Webex App Hub
When you connect with bots in Webex App, you can create workflows to improve your experience with consuming third-party apps in Webex App.
Bots and other apps allow you to increase your productivity by extending the functionality of Webex App. The Webex App Hub contains a catalog of apps developed by Cisco and third-party developers that are available to anyone using Webex App and Webex Meetings.
Many of the bots developed by Cisco follow a certain pattern: these bots send you customized notifications in the corresponding Webex App space to tell you about something happening in a third-party site application. For example, the bot posts a message to let you know when a file is uploaded to a Box folder or when a row is added to a Smartsheet.
Some bots allow provide additional functionality. For example, with Jira and Trello, you can use commands in the Webex App space to have the bot complete actions for you on the third-party site.
Having trouble setting up these workflows? If you get stuck or run into any issues with a bot, contact app developer support for help.
