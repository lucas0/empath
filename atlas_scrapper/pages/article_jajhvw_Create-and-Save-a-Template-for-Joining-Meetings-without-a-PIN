Create and Save a Template for Joining Meetings without a PIN
You can create your own template to always allow people to host your scheduled meetings without a PIN. Save these settings as a template to be used again later.
Before you begin

Your site administrator must first allow meetings held on your site to be joined without a PIN. Contact your site administrator for more information.
1
Sign in to your Cisco Webex Site.
2
Select Meeting > Schedule to go to the Schedule a Meeting page.
3
Enter meeting details and then select Show Advanced Options > Scheduling Options.
4
For an Alternate host, select Let anyone with a host account on this site or anyone joining from an authenticated Cisco video device in this organization host my meeting.
5
Click Save as template.
6
Enter the name of the template and check the Save as a standard template check box.

  There is a 20-character limit when naming your template.
7
Click OK to save the changes as a standard template .
For any future meeting, select and use the saved standard template to ensure that all meetings going forward will not need a PIN. Contact your site administrator to save this setting at a site level.
The new template now appears in the Meetings template drop-down list.
