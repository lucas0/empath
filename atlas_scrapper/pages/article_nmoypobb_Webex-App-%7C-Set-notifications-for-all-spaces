Webex App | Set notifications for all spaces
Notifications help you keep up to date with what's happening, so you don't miss anything. You can configure notifications globally, so the settings apply to all your spaces.
Webex App allows you to set notifications in two ways: globally so that the settings apply to all of your spaces or individually so the settings apply just to certain spaces. These settings work together to make sure you get notified about the messages that matter most to you. See Tips for Managing Notifications for help choosing the best combinations.

  You can also get smart notifications on all your devices that Webex App installed. See Smart Notifications on Multiple Devices for more details.
