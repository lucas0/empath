Webex App | Play a notification sound when someone is waiting in the lobby
When you lock a meeting as a host or cohost, sometimes it’s difficult to notice when someone’s waiting in the lobby to join. Choose to have Webex App play a unique sound on your computer when someone's in the lobby, waiting to be let in.
When you set a notification sound, it's set for all meetings, including any meeting that you're currently in. You only hear the sound when you're the host or cohost. The sound plays once every 10 seconds, regardless of how many people have entered the lobby.
