Webex App | Add someone to a meeting
You can add people to your ongoing meeting. The person is invited as a guest, and you'll be able to share your screen or application with them. But, they're not added to the space and can't see any messages or shared content, including whiteboards and files.
If the meeting takes place in a space in Webex App, not a standard Webex or Personal Room meeting, you can add people who are new to the app, but you'll need their email address. Depending on the Webex App plan your company has, you may be able to add more than one person.
The person you invite gets an invitation to join the meeting and can join or ignore it.
If the meeting hasn't started and you want to add more people, update the meeting to add invitees.
Windows, Mac, and Web
iPhone and iPad
Android
From a meeting, click , select Invite people, then enter the person's name or email address.
