Webex App | View or edit files in a linked folder
When a folder in Microsoft OneDrive or SharePoint Online is linked to a space in Webex App, you can view or edit the files in the linked folder directly in Webex App. Your administrator must configure this option before you can use linked folders.
Desktop
Android
iOS
In the space, click Content, and then select Folder from OneDrive.
Browse files in your Microsoft OneDrive or SharePoint folder directly within Webex.

  Depending upon your permissions, youâ€™ll have access to OneDrive or SharePoint file actions from the embedded file browser including uploading, downloading, sharing, deleting, etc.
You can choose to switch to a basic view of the folder, view details about the folder or remove the folder from the space. In addition, you can undock the embedded browser from Webex using the Expand button.
