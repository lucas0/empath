Disable users' ability to edit in-meeting display names
You can disable the ability to edit in-meeting display names in meetings and webinars.
This feature requires Webex Meetings version 42.11 or later. To find out which version you're using, see Find your Webex Meetings version number.
This feature is enabled by default. It allows meeting participants and webinar panelists to edit their display names while in a meeting or webinar, and allows the host and cohosts to edit the display name of any meeting participant or webinar panelist.
If your organization wants to block users' ability to edit display names, you can disable this feature.
1
Sign in to Control Hub, then under Services, click Meeting.
2
Next to Meetings Hosted by my Organization, toggle off Enable edit names in meetings.
