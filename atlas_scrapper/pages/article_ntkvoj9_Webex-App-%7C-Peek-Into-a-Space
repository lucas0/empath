Webex App | Peek Into a Space
Sometimes you have unread messages in a space but don't have time to follow up on them right away. You can peek into a space to view the space without marking it as read or sending a read receipt.
Desktop and Web
Mobile
Go to Messaging , right-click an unread space, and then click Peek.

  You'll see the peek mode icon in the messaging area to remind you that you're peeking in a space.
To stop peeking in a space, navigate away from the space, and then click on the space to read as normal.
