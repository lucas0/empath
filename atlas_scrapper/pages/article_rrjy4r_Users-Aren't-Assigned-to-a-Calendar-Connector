Users Aren't Assigned to a Calendar Connector
Users aren't assigned to one of your calendar connectors.
This problem can happen if you register the calendar connector Expressway-C to one organization and then later register it to another. Sometimes, the node wasn't removed from the original organization, causing this problem.
Try the following in Control Hub:
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Services, and then click View all under Resources on the Hybrid Calendar card.
Locate the connector host Expressway-C node and associated calendar connector.
If the node is listed as offline, remove it.
If the node isn't listed, or isn't offline, click your administrator username and then Feedback to open a case.
