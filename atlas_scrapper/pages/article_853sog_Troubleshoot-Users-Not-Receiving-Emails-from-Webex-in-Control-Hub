In this article
If users arenâ€™t receiving emails from Webex services, you can check what the status of the last email sent to them was in Control Hub. This status helps you understand what happened to that email, and provides you with insights on how to troubleshoot the problem.
Check the Status of the Last Email Sent to a User
When a user gets an email from Webex, you can check and see if that email was successfully delivered or not. The table below shows you the possible statuses that an email can have, and what actions you can take to help troubleshoot if the email wasn't delivered yet.
