Customer Virtual Assistant Dialogflow Integration

Use Dialogflow to create a conversational user experience that is backed by natural language processing and machine learning. You can also use webhooks in Dialogflow to send or receive data to other services. For more information on creating a Customer Virtual Assistant, see Create a New Customer Virtual Assistant.
