Enable WebRTC to Join a Microsoft Teams Meeting from Board, Desk, and Room Series
By enabling WebRTC in Control Hub, Cisco devices and participants with devices in Personal mode invited to a Microsoft Teams meeting can join the meeting directly from their devices with One Button to Push (OBTP).
In order to enable Microsoft Teams WebRTC Calling, the hybrid calendar needs to be on. Make sure that the web engine is on as well â€“ If not, follow the steps described here to turn it on.
The anonymous join setting is on by default in Microsoft Teams. If it is off, you can turn it on in Microsoft Teams so that devices can join over WebRTC. For more information about how to enable this setting, go here.
If you want to disable the default buttons on the home screen, follow the instructions here.

You need the CE9.14.3 software version for devices linked to Webex edge.

WebRTC does not work with Microsoft Teams Live Events. If users receive an OBTP (One Button to Push) attendee link in a Live Events email, OBTP will not be activated on their device. To join Live Events meetings, users must use Microsoft Teams or a web browser.
For WebRTC joins, the following URLs are supported: teams.microsoft.com, gov.teams.microsoft.us, dod.teams.microsoft.us, login.microsoftonline.us, login.microsoftonline.com, and app.whiteboard.microsoft.com.
If users use safelinks or any email security protocol that changes the URL of a Microsoft Teams meeting, OBTP will also not work.
