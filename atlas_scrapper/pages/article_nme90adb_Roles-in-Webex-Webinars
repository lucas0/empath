Everyone except attendees can be assigned additional roles during the webinar:
Presenter—Responsible for sharing and annotating presentations, whiteboards, documents, and applications in a webinar. A host, cohost, panelist, or interpreter automatically becomes the presenter when they share their screen.
Note Taker—The host or cohost can assign a designated note taker either when scheduling or during a webinar. The note taker can publish notes to all participants at any time during the webinar.
Closed Captionist—Responsible for publishing captions in real-time during the webinar.
For more information about roles and how to assign them, see Manage notes, meeting minutes, and closed captions in Webex Meetings and Webex Webinars.
