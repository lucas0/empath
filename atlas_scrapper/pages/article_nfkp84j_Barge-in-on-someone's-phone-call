Barge in on someone's phone call
With the barge-in feature, you can drop in on an active call, essentially creating a three-way call. Use this tool to monitor or speak with a customer and agent at the same time.
If enabled, you can use the Feature Access Code (FAC) on your desk phone to answer someone else’s phone call or barge in on a call they’ve already answered. This feature must be enabled by your administrator. To enable for a user, see Allow users to barge in to other people's phone calls.
1
Enter *33 on your phone.
If set up this way, you'll hear a tone letting you know that the system recognizes the access code.
2
Enter the phone number of the person whose call you want to barge in to.
When connected, you're in a three-way call.
