Configure single number reach in Control Hub
In this article
The Single Number Reach feature allows users to make, receive, and move calls to or from any designated device. For example, when a user is on a call using their desktop phone, they can push or pull that call to or from their mobile phone. When users place long distance or international calls from a phone, usage is tracked and reflected on your invoice.
Create a single number reach for a location
The Single Number Reach feature isnâ€™t automatically set up when service is provisioned. Before users can start using the Single Number Reach feature, you must first create a Single Number Reach for a location, and then assign a phone number to be used as the Single Number Reach portal.
