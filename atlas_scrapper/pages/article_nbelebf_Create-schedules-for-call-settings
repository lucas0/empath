Create schedules for call settings
Create schedules with different times of the day or days of the week and apply them to selective call settings such as sequential ring, simultaneous ring, or priority alert. These call settings are automatically activated based on the time frame in the schedule, making it more convenient for users to manage their calls.
1
Sign in to Control Hub, then under Management, click Users.
2
Select a user and click the Calling tab.
3
Go to the Call handling section and select Schedules.
4
Click New Schedule.
5
Enter a Schedule Name.
6
Select the appropriate Start Date/Time and End Date/Time.
7
Check All day event and/or Repeats, if needed.
8
Click Save.
The created schedule appears under Schedule Name. You can expand the created schedule and click Add event to add more events to it.

  A user can also create schedules on their own in the User Portal. For more details, see: Create a schedule to apply to your call settings. Any changes made to these settings by the user will be reflected in both the User Portal and Control Hub.
What to do next
Now that the schedule is created, you can apply it to selective call settings such as sequential ring, simultaneous ring settings, or priority alert.
