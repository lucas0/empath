Webex App | Create a space
In Webex App, when you send a message to a group for the first time, you create a space for the group to talk. Spaces work best for a group of people collaborating on a specific topic or project. You can send messages, make calls, have video meetings, share files, and use whiteboards. The next time you message the group, your conversation picks right up where you've left it.
