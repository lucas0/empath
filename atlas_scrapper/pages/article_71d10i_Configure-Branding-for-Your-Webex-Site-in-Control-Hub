Configure Branding for Your Webex Site in Control Hub
You can update the branding on your Webex site so that it matches the look and feel of your companyâ€™s brand.
About Branding Services
Self-service branding is an optional feature that gives you the flexibility to customize your Webex site after it has been provisioned. To improve awareness of your brand, you can modify the header and navigation elements for your site. The self-service branding feature does not include branding for support or for site footers.

  Cisco partners need to allow individual company branding on their Webex sites. From the partner view of admin.webex.com go to Settings > Branding and check the box for Enable all customers to use their own logo.

  As part of the branding, a Webex watermark may appear when you share content during meetings. You can't update the watermark to match your own branding, but if you want to remove it, contact Cisco support.

  If your site has existing branding by Cisco, a warning message appears when you use the self-service branding tool. If you select Overwrite Current Branding, the existing branding is permanently lost. You cannot recreate your existing branding with the tool.
Configure the Branding for Your Site Header
Before you begin
Ensure that the logo image meets the following size and format requirements.
The image file for your logo must be in one of the following formats: .gif, .jpg, or .png.
The maximum size of the image file is 900 pixels wide, by 42 pixels high.

  If necessary, resize the logo image file to meet this requirement. To prevent distortion of the image, ensure that you maintain the image proportions (width and height) when you resize the image. For more information, see the documentation for your image-editing software.
