Use mobile device management to configure Webex Meetings
IT administrators can use a mobile device management (MDM) AppConfig service to configure the Meetings app on managed mobile devices. This way, administrators can control user access to app functions such as sign in methods, meeting sources, and video access.
If you're interested in Microsoft Intune SDK MDM or Blackberry SDK MDM support, you can sign up for the mobile application management program.
iOS
Android
Overview
Managed configurations, previously known as application restrictions, allow an organization's IT administrator to remotely specify settings for the Meetings mobile app.
Meetings defines the managed configuration options that can be remotely set by an IT administrator. These are arbitrary settings that can be changed by a managed configuration provider. If your app is running in a work profile, your IT administrator can also change your app's managed configuration.
A managed configurations provider is another app controlled by the IT administrator which is running on the same device. The IT administrator communicates configuration changes to the managed configuration provider app, which then makes changes to Meetings.
Prerequisites
iOS 9.0 or later
Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) software such as Jamf Pro, AirWatch, Microsoft Intune, or MobileIron
Managed applications are uploaded to the App Store
Configuration policies for Meetings
IT administrators can add configuration policies to devices that are enrolled in an EMM solution.
Sign in to the EMM console and approve Meetings from Managed Google Play. IT administrators can then add app configuration policies for the Meetings mobile app. After a user installs Meetings, their device automatically configures the app.

Sign in to the Meetings mobile app with an MDM service

  The Meetings mobile app behaves normally if no MDM Service is set up, or if SiteURL and EnableForceLogin aren't configured.
SiteURL is configured
After entering an email and tapping Next, the configured SiteURL is automatically listed for users.
SiteURL and EnableForceLogin are configured
After entering an email and tapping Next, the configured SiteURL must be used to sign in to the app. If the user isn't signed in but attempts to connect to a meeting, the app prompts them to sign in.
If your site has single sign-on (SSO), users are automatically taken to their SSO page when they sign in to the mobile app. They don't have to enter their email address first.
Configure the default audio setting
Set DefaultAudioCallType by entering the value of the audio connection that you want to set as the default. The audio connection options have the following values:
Audio Connection Type Value
Call Me 1
Use Internet for audio 2
Call In 3
Don't connect audio 5
The default audio connection that you set applies to users joining a meeting for the first time. If a user changes their audio connection, the audio connection they chose becomes their default. If you don't set a value for DefaultAudioCallType or set an invalid value, Use Internet for audio is set to the default.
