Release notes for beta Hybrid Services connectors
Read about the latest beta channel software releases for Expressway-based Hybrid Services. We document new functionality, bug fixes, and general improvements. (Use Control Hub to manage connector software upgrades and schedule when they are performed. Connector software is automatically downloaded to and installed on the Expressway.)
Beta Disclaimer
Beta releases of hybrid service connectors are not at the level of performance and compatibility of a final, generally available, product offering. Beta releases may not operate correctly and may be substantially modified prior to their general availability. Cisco is not obligated to make any version of Beta releases commercially available. 1
For Hybrid Services, X12.5 is the minimum supported version of Expressway for new connector host registrations to the cloud. X8.11 is the minimum version for existing registrations to the cloud.

Includes a change that allows joining a Webex meeting using the join URL even if the join URL is not available in the body of the meeting invitation.

When an organizer creates a meeting from an existing Webex Teams space (either from the schedule button or by copying and pasting the space information into the meeting invitation) and adds attendees who are not Webex Teams users, the Hybrid Calendar Service no longer sends an error email to the organizer indicating that these attendees couldn’t be added to the space.

The Hybrid Calendar Service can now parse Cisco Webex Personal Room links in a format like site.webex.com/meet/<userid> (the https:// prefix is no longer required). The service can parse the link from either the location or body of a meeting invitation and use it to provide join notifications (One Button to Push).
Fixed an issue with the TMS integration where the Calendar Connector could encounter a proxy error and fail to initialize after a restart. When this happens, the administrator sees the alarm "Conferencing Connector initialization failed."

April 5, 2019
Updated @meet join details to support two join-by-phone toll numbers. If two toll numbers are configured in Webex, both should now show up in @meet invitations.
8.10-1.0.5609
March 22, 2019

8.10-1.0.5545
February 8, 2019

8.10-1.0.5533
January 18, 2019
Fixed CSCvo03678 Autodiscover fails for accounts with redirectURL.
Backed out an OBTP join notification change from December for Cisco TMS/TMSXE integrations. The change had caused removal of the bridge for meetings that were scheduled on TMS after they were processed by the Hybrid Calendar Service.
8.10-1.0.5513
December 14, 2018
On the Microsoft Exchange Configuration page, added an Enable SCP record lookup option in the Discovery section. When unchecked, the Calendar Connector will not attempt an SCP lookup in Active Directory during the Autodiscover process.
On the Microsoft Exchange Configuration page, the maximum length of the Service Account Password field has changed from 120 to 128 characters.
Cisco TMS/TMSXE systems will now send OBTP join notifications if there is a non-Cisco SIP URI in the location field of the meeting invitation.
Fixed one scenario which may cause the “Meeting processing time too long” alarm to be raised.
8.10-1.0.5475
November 30, 2018
Updated @meet and @webex meeting invitation template to version 2.1.0.0. Changes include adding the Meeting Number field towards the top of the template, consistent placement of the global call-in number links and consistent font size formatting.
If a meeting organizer invites an attendee who is not a Webex Teams user to a meeting with @meet in the location field, the Hybrid Calendar Service will no longer create an account for that user and add them to the Teams space. Instead, the meeting organizer receives an email notifying them that an attendee could not be added to the space.
The Hybrid Calendar Service now detects join links with the *@ meetup.webex.com format for One Button To Push (OBTP) join notifications.
Previously, the Calendar Connector could fill the disk with GSSAPIBindRequest-JAAS-Config configuration files in the tmp folder. We now delete these files as they are created, to avoid filling the disk space.
Previously, if an Exchange environment used a generic redirect for invalid URLs (for example, autodiscover.example.com/autodiscover/autodiscover.xml) and the redirect resulted in a browser response with data, the Hybrid Calendar Service would keep retrying the URL in step 2 of the Autodiscover process. This could cause excessive requests to the web server. Now, the Hybrid Calendar Service marks the redirect as invalid if it doesn't recognize the data.
Fixed an issue where TMS/XE systems would not send OBTP join notifications if there was a Webex Teams space meeting link URL detected in the meeting body of the meeting invitation.
8.10-1.0.5328—Urgent upgrade (will automatically upgrade within 24 hours, at the scheduled time)
October 10, 2018
Fixed CSCvk79308—Calendar Connector SCIM client fails to traverse credentialed web proxy (Exchange setup page).
Fixed CSCvm78853—Static Exchange configuration won't save.
Updated the field help and character entry limit for the Redirect URL text box on the Autodiscover Redirect URL Trust List configuration page.
Added support for the new Default Language setting in Cisco Webex Control Hub.
Fixed issue which occasionally resulted in @meet invitations not being processed for some users with uppercase characters in their email address.
Fixed a logging issue when saving the Microsoft Exchange configuration.
Internal performance optimization to reduce requests to a cloud service.
8.10-1.0.5282
September 14, 2018
No release notes for this maintenance upgrade.
8.10-1.0.5279
September 7, 2018
Added an Expressway configuration page that administrators can use to allow or block Autodiscover redirection URLs. Running an Autodiscover test automatically adds URLs to the list in pending state, or administrators can add URLs to the list manually. Pending URLs are blocked unless an administrator chooses to allow them.
8.10-1.0.5260
August 31, 2018
Updated the Calendar Connector version numbering from 8.8.-1.0.xxxx to 8.10-1.0.xxxxx.
Fixed an issue where join notifications (also known as One Button to Push, or OBTP) for meetings with both @spark in the meeting location field and Webex Productivity Tools in the meeting body may not appear on all supported Webex Teams platforms.
Fixed an issue where the Skype for Business join link doesn't appear in @webex meeting invitations if the Webex site has not been linked to Control Hub or the Personal Room setting is not configured for users in the Webex Teams app. (This issue was fixed in the cloud and does not require a Calendar Connector upgrade.)
8.8-1.0.5234
August 17, 2018
No release notes for this maintenance upgrade.
8.8-1.0.5219
August 10, 2018
Fixed issue present in Calendar Connector build 5201 where the Calendar Connector may stop operating if the hybridservices.c_cal logging level is set to DEBUG.
Fixed an issue where join notifications (also known as One Button to Push, or OBTP) may not work when using @webex with FedRAMP, telephony service provider (TSP), or CMR Hybrid Webex sites. (This issue was fixed in the cloud and does not require a Calendar Connector upgrade.)
8.8-1.0.5201
August 3, 2018
We've introduced @meet as a new keyword, and new keyword modifiers :space and :myroom to control the behavior of the @meet and @webex keywords.
The keyword @meet and the compound keywords @meet:space or @webex:space all create a space in Webex App.
The compound keywords @meet:myroom and @webex:myroom work the same way as @webex, using the user's Cisco Webex Personal Room. Each option adds the appropriate join details to the body of the meeting invitation.
Users with multiple Cisco Webex sites can still use @webex:<site> for the time being, but we strongly recommend configuring the My Personal Room setting in the Cisco Webex Teams app to specify which site @webex uses. This setting also indicates which site the app should monitor for participants entering the user's Personal Room lobby.
The @spark keyword will also continue to work for the time being. However, if your organization is currently using @spark, we recommend instead using @webex:space or @meet because @spark will eventually be removed at a future time once usage drops.
8.8-1.0.5194
July 27, 2018
Fixed issue to allow parsing of SIP URI join links from meeting invitations using both the "sip%3A" and "sip:" formats. Previously "sip%3A" was not recognized and would not result in a join notification appearing in the Webex Teams app.
Fixed issue where in some cases @spark or @webex meetings mistakenly had double sip:sip:<URI> in the SIP URI joinable link. This caused failures when attempting to join these meetings. To address this issue, we no longer add sip: if it already exists.
8.8-1.0.5158
July 17, 2018
Fixed the top priority issue configuring the Calendar Connector on Expressway X8.11, which was causing two problems:
Entering an email address in the Discovery section of the Microsoft Exchange Configuration page causes the configuration to fail. Until we fix this issue, the only way to configure a new Calendar Connector or change the Exchange configuration is by leaving the Email Address field blank, which means that you will not be able to test your configuration as you save it. As a workaround, you can use the steps in Test Microsoft Exchange Autodiscovery and Impersonation to try to simulate the test, from a machine that has network conditions as similar as possible to the Expressway-C.
On the Webex Configuration page, using the Test Connection button causes the same failure. The workaround is to click Save without testing.
8.8-1.0.5144
July 11, 2018
Rebranding updates for the user email notification template.
Added German localization for "Join using Microsoft Skype for Business" text in meeting invitations.
8.8-1.0.5100
June 22, 2018
Fixed the integration of @spark meetings with TMS/XE (added sip: protocol prefix to SIP URIs).

Added retry logic to help ensure meeting join notifications appear when other backend services are busy.
8.8-1.0.5077
June 8, 2018
For meeting invitations which only include a Webex Personal Room URL in the meeting body (with no SIP URI), clicking the join notification (OBTP) in the Webex Teams app will now join the meeting through the Webex Teams app. Previously, clicking the join notifications for these meetings would cross-launch the meeting in a Webex browser window.
Updated text strings in email notifications for Webex Teams rebranding.
Updated text strings in the Expressway user interface for Webex Teams rebranding.
8.8-1.0.5045
June 1, 2018

May 11, 2018
Fixed one cause of the "Meeting processing time too long" alarm, which would sometimes be triggered due to processing a high volume of attendee responses.
Fixed scenario where invitees who declined a meeting were counted against the maximum attendee limit. Because of this scenario, some attendees would not receive the meeting join notification (OBTP).

April 27, 2018
Added localized text translations for "Join using Microsoft Skype for Business" link to @webex meeting invitations.
Fixed how the TLS configuration is applied for the Microsoft Exchange Autodiscover process. In the Calendar Connector Exchange configuration, there are two different settings that can dictate whether certificate validation is performed when making a secure connection. Each of these settings has an option of On or Off. If set to On, certificate validation is performed. If set to Off, no certificate validation is performed. The settings and their intended scopes are as follows:
TLS Verify Mode—This setting is used when making a connection to Exchange.
LDAP TLS Verify Mode—This setting is used when making a connection to an LDAP server to search for Exchange Autodiscover SCP records.
Prior to the fix, the LDAP TLS Verify Mode was used for all connections during the Exchange Autodiscover process, regardless of whether performing an LDAP query or an Exchange request. So if LDAP TLS Verify Mode was On and TLS Verify Mode was Off, certificate validation was always performed when connecting to Exchange during Autodiscover. Conversely, if LDAP TLS Verify Mode was Off and TLS Verify Mode was On, certificate validation was not performed when connecting to Exchange during Autodiscover.
After the fix, LDAP TLS Verify Mode is used only when making a connection to an LDAP server during Autodiscover, and TLS Verify Mode is used for all other connections involved in the Autodiscover process.
Fixed how the Calendar Connector searches for SCP pointers.
Autodiscover flow steps are explained in https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ee332364%28v=exchg.140%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396.
For step 1 (SCP lookup), further detail is provided in https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/dn467395(v=exchg.150).aspx.
The second link explains the difference between the two types of SCP objects for Autodiscover provided by Exchange:
SCP pointers—These objects contain information that points to specific LDAP servers that should be used to locate Autodiscover SCP objects for the user's domain. SCP pointers are stamped with the following GUID: 67661d7F-8FC4-4fa7-BFAC-E1D7794C1F68.
SCP URLs—These objects contain URLs for Autodiscover endpoints. SCP URLs are stamped with the following GUID: 77378F46-2C66-4aa9-A6A6-3E7A48B19596.
Prior to the fix, the Calendar Connector search for SCP pointers was not working properly. However, search for SCP URLs was working properly all along, and SCP URLs are the common type necessary for successful Autodiscover. There were no known reports of Calendar Connector Autodiscover failing due to unsuccessful SCP pointer lookup; the problem was only found by means of code review. With this fix, the Calendar Connector search for SCP pointers now works properly.

April 20, 2018
Added "Join using Microsoft Skype for Business" link to @webex meeting invitations. This text currently only appears in English. Support for other languages will be released shortly.
8.8-1.0.4945
April 13, 2018
If an autodiscovery URL for a user's email domain was found via SCP lookup in Active Directory and the initial autodiscovery response from Exchange returned a RedirectTarget address, the Calendar Connector reused the original autodiscovery URL that was retrieved via SCP rather than a new URL based on the RedirectTarget address. This could cause a flow loop where the actual user settings were never retrieved and that user could never be assigned to a Calendar Connector or activated. This is now fixed so that the email domain of the RedirectTarget address is always used to acquire the next autodiscovery URL in the flow.
8.8-1.0.4942
April 6, 2018
