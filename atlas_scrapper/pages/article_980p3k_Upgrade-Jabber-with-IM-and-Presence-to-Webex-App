Upgrade Jabber with IM and Presence to Webex App
This article guides you through moving your organization from Jabber with IM and Presence to Webex App. With Webex App and Control Hub, you benefit from modernizing the experience for admins and users while keeping the feature set and messaging, meeting, and calling workflows that everyone's familiar with. A visual is included to give you a high-level overview of the steps, followed by more specific details and pointers to helpful documentation to make sure your upgrade is a success.

Customers with Jabber Phone Only mode or our Webex apps will not experience any change.
