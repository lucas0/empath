Manage your domains
Some Control Hub features require proof of domain ownership. Others use domains to ensure the security and integrity of your organization. You can use domains to help with user management. This article describes how to add, verify, claim, release, or remove domains when you don't need them any more.
You can drill down into meetings or calls per participant, and see detailed information about their audio, video, and sharing quality. Data is updated every minute for Webex Meetings and Call on Webex, so you can diagnose problems as they arise. Data for Webex Calling is updated at the end of each call.

Verify domains
Verify your domains to prove to Webex that you own them. Verifying domains allows you to claim users into your organization if they signed up into a different organization. You also must verify your domains before you can claim them.
To verify domains, we provide a token to add to your domain host's DNS TXT record. To confirm that you own the domain, we check for this token on the DNS server.
Claim domains
Claim a domain to associate that domain to automatically be created within your organization. Users who sign themselves up for Webex are also associate with this domain. Otherwise, users who sign themselves up are created in a general organization with all the other "free" users. You cannot manage their services until you claim the users into your organization. Keep in mind that you donâ€™t have to claim a domain to claim a user into your organization.
Users who exist in the free consumer organization are not automatically converted to your organization. You must convert these users. We recommend that you convert consumer users to your organization before claiming the domain.
Domains aren't claimed for two different organizations. The purpose of the domain claim is to prevent other organizations from using the domain.
You can release a domain if you want to claim it in a different organization (if you own the domain and manage both organizations).
