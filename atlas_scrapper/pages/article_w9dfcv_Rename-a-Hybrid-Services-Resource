Rename a Hybrid Services Resource
You can change the name of any registered clusters that run Cisco Webex Hybrid Services to make it easy to remember and find in Cisco Webex Control Hub. The changed name only appears in Control Hub, not on the on-premises resources themselves.
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Services, and then click All Resources from the on-premises resources card.
All of your registered on-premises resources appear as cards that contain information and settings that you can manage. You can also add a new cluster with the Add Resource button.
2
(Optional) Filter the resources that display on this page or search for a specific cluster name.
3
From a resource card, click Settings.
4
Enter a new name for the resource.
