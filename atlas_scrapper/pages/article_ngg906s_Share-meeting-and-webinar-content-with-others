Share meeting and webinar content with others
If you hosted a meeting or webinar that used Webex Assistant for Meetings, the highlights are available on your Webex site after the meeting or webinar ends. If you recorded the meeting or webinar, the transcript and recording are also available on your Webex site. You can share this meeting or webinar content with others.
Webex Assistant is available in Meetings and Webex Webinars (not available for webinars in webcast view).
In addition to Meetings and Webinars, Webex Assistant is also available for the Webex App. Meetings started or joined from a space don't support Webex Assistant.
Webex for Government doesn't support Webex Assistant.
This feature requires Cisco Webex video platform version 2.0 with joining meetings from video systems enabled. To find out which version youâ€™re using, see Find your Webex Meetings version number.
Hosts can turn on or turn off the Webex Assistant during the meeting or webinar. To automatically turn on the Webex Assistant whenever you start a meeting or webinar, see Set your Webex Meetings scheduling preferences.
Closed captions are not turned on by default for the hosts or participants when Webex Assistant is turned on by hosts. See Show or hide automated closed captions during a Webex Meeting or Webinar. Webex remembers if you did or didn't use automated captions in your previous meeting or webinar, and automatically turns them on or off for your next one, depending on your last usage.
Webex site admins are able to turn off automatic post-meeting emails to prevent cluttering inboxes. To turn these post-meeting emails on or off, contact your Webex site admin.
