Use the whiteboard in meetings
In a meeting, anyone can start a whiteboard and begin two-way collaboration across some video system devices and Webex App participants, on an infinite canvas.
Board Series and Desk Series devices support this feature. Webex DX Series devices aren’t supported. When a whiteboard is shared by another participant in a meeting, the DX device receives a one-way, noninteractive view of the whiteboard. However, it’s still possible to create whiteboards with fewer tools with the DX Series devices, and share them in meetings.
You can also annotate shared documents during a meeting, instead of creating a whiteboard.
