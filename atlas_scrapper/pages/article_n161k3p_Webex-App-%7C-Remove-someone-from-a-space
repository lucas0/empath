Webex App | Remove someone from a space
You may find you need to restrict access to a space in Webex App after someone has already joined it. If the space is unmoderated, or you are the moderator, you can remove people from the space. When you remove someone from a space, their content remains visible, based on your companyâ€™s data retention policy.
