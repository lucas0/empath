Make and answer calls
This Help article is for Cisco Video Phone 8875 registered to Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM).
You can make and answer calls with either the touchscreen or the hardkeys on your phone.

  If there's a meeting ongoing on the phone, leave the meeting to make or answer a call. The phone can't handle a meeting and a call at the same time.
If you have a Cisco Headset with the call control feature connected to your phone, youâ€™re able to answer a call with its call button.
Need help for Cisco Headsets? See Cisco Headsets.
