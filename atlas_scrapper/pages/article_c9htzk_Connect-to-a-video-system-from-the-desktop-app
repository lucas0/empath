Connect to a video system from the desktop app
When you're all in the same physical space, you can wirelessly share your screen with a video system, or connect seamlessly when joining Webex Meetings, Webex Webinars, or Webex Events (classic). Your Meetings desktop app detects video systems using ultrasound to make connecting easy.
1
Click Connect to video system to join the meeting from a compatible device. The app looks for nearby video systems.
2
If the app detects nearby video systems, you'll see a list of those devices. Select the video system that you want to use from the list.
3
If your video system isn't detected, have the app call your device. Enter the address of the video system and then select the device when it appears in the list. You can choose to connect without pressing 1.
4
If you're connecting to a cloud-registered video system that's not already connected with the Meetings desktop app, enter the code shown on the device, and then click OK.
The app either automatically connects to your video system or it calls your device when you select Join meeting.
What to do next
Windows and Mac: To show video on the connected video system only when no content is being shared, go to More options in the desktop app, and then toggle Show Video on Video System Only on.
