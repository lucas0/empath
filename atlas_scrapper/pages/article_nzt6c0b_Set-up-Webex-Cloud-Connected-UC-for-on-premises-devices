Set up Webex Cloud-Connected UC for on-premises devices
In this article
You must set up the on-premises devices in your organization to communicate with the Control Hub. Once the devices are connected, you can view telemetry and analytics information for those devices on the Control Hub.
Get started

If your organization has already established in communicating with the Control Hub, refer to the Activate Webex Cloud-Connected UC for Organizations.
If you do not have a Control Hub in your organization, contact your Cisco partner to submit a Webex Cloud-Connected UC order for you.
You have completed the order through Cisco Commerce Workspace (CCW), for information on how to order Webex Cloud-Connected UC, refer to the Cisco Collaboration Flex Plan Ordering Guide.
