Download your Webex recordings
Download your own recordings and allow others to download and play the recordings too. Cohosts who don't have access to recordings and attendees must reach out to you for the download link and password (if required).
The standard format for all recordings is MP4.
Anyone that you share the recording link with can play and download it from the player view. Share it with attendees so they can refer back to the meeting, or with people who couldn't attend.
