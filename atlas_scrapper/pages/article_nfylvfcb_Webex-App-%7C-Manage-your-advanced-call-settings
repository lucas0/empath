Webex App | Manage your advanced call settings
If you're set up with Webex Calling or calling from your Service Provider, you can manage call settings such as voicemail, call forwarding, and call waiting under Advanced Call Settings in Webex App.

  Some of these call settings are only available in Advanced Call Settings if they have been enabled by your administrator. If you’re not sure about which options are enabled for you, contact your Service Provider.
Reject Anonymous Calls
The Anonymous Call Rejection feature automatically rejects calls with blocked IDs or unidentified numbers.
1
Open Advanced Call Settings in Webex App.
2
Select Incoming Calls.
3
To automatically reject unidentified numbers, turn on the Anonymous Call Rejection toggle.
Set Up Call Forwarding
By allowing you to forward calls to a phone number other than your voicemail, Call Forwarding keeps you connected wherever you are. You can decide when calls are forwarded and to which phone numbers.
1
Open Advanced Call Settings in Webex App.
2
Select Incoming Calls > Call Forwarding.
3
Turn on the toggle and enter a phone number for the types of calls that you want forwarded:
When No Answer—Calls that aren't answered after a set number of rings are forwarded.
Use Number of rings to set how many times you want the call to ring before it's forwarded.
When Busy—When you are already on a call, all other calls are forwarded.
When Not Reachable—All unanswered and busy calls are forwarded.

  If you want to forward all of your calls to another number, you can do that right in Webex App.
Set Up Sequential Ring
When Sequential Ring is turned on, incoming calls ring a set of phone numbers one at a time until the call is answered. If the call still isn't answered when the sequence is complete, it's transferred to another phone number or to voicemail, depending on your settings for unanswered calls.
The caller hears a comfort message during the process, so they know the system is attempting to find you.
You can choose the following settings when creating a Sequential Ring list:
Set up to five phone numbers to ring in a set order.
Choose the number of rings before the call is transferred to the next phone number in the sequence.
Turn on Answer Confirmation, which requires the person who answers the call to confirm that they have accepted the call.
Choose whether the Sequential Ring list rings if you're already on a call.
Set a schedule for Sequential Ring (for example, turn it on at weekends).
Allow callers to interrupt the call sequence at any time and be transferred to your unanswered calls process (for example, voicemail). This option is announced before callers are transferred to the ring list.
1
Open Advanced Call Settings in Webex App.
2
Select Incoming Calls > Sequential Ring.
3
To set up your sequential list, select Ring Numbers and enter the phone numbers in the order that you want them to be rung.
For each number, you can choose how many times the call rings before transferring to the next phone number in the sequence.
4
Check Answer confirmation required for each number as required.
5
You can choose the following additional settings:
Setting Description
Ring Base Location First
Turn on this option, if you want your base location (primary phone) to always ring first.
You can choose how many times the call rings before it's transferred to the next phone number in the sequence.
Continue if busy
Check Continue if busy if you want calls to be transferred to the Sequential Ring list when you’re already on a call at your base location.
Caller May Cancel
Turn on Caller May Cancel if you want callers to be able to skip the call sequence and go directly to voicemail.
