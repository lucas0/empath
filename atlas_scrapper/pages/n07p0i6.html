Configure call forwarding for users and workspaces
Call forwarding allows transfer or forward of calls to another phone number or directly to voicemail. If call forwarding is enabled, you can choose when you want calls to forward and who they forward to.
The settings that you choose for call forwarding override the current configurations. You can activate or modify the following call forwarding settings for Webex Calling users and workspaces.
Forward all calls—Choose this option to forward all calls to a specific phone number. You can:
Enter a specific internal or external phone number to which you want to forward the calls.
Select Allow forwarded calls to leave voicemail. This option is only available for selection if you've entered a valid internal phone number with voicemail service enabled.
Select Play a brief tone for forwarded calls to play a brief tone whenever a call is forwarded.
Forward calls during busy lines—Choose this option to forward the calls when the line is busy. You can:
Enter a specific internal or external phone number to which you want to forward the calls.
Select Allow forwarded calls to leave voicemail. This option is only available for selection if you've entered a valid internal phone number with voicemail service enabled.

If call waiting is enabled, this feature isn't triggered.
Forward calls when unanswered—Choose this option to forward the calls when it’s unanswered or exceeds a certain number of rings. You can:
Enter a specific internal or external phone number to which you want to forward the calls.
Set the Number of rings before forwarding. Once the call exceeds this number of rings, it will be forwarded to the phone number entered.
Select Allow forwarded calls to leave voicemail. This option is only available for selection if you've entered a valid internal phone number with voicemail service enabled.
