Disable chat notifications on Cisco devices
If the chat notifications get too busy or distracting during meetings, it is possible to disable them completely.
The chat notifications are enabled by default. You can disable them from Control Hub (for individual devices or in bulk) or from the local web interface of the device. Read the Device Configurations article for more information on how to access it.

This feature is available on Webex for Government but is off by default. Follow this setting to enable it.
When the web interface of the device is opened, select Settings under the Setup tab, and choose the following configuration :
Configuration > Webex > Meetings MeetingChatPreview : Choose False to disable the chat notifications and True to enable them.
