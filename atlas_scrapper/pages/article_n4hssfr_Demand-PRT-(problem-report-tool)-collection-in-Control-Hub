Demand PRT (problem report tool) collection in Control Hub
In this article
With the new On-Demand PRT feature for Webex Calling, an Administrator from the Control Hub portal, can remotely initiate a PRT file collection (compressed set of support files) from a WxC MPP phone that is actively registered to the platform. This can be helpful when trying to troubleshoot an issue when no onsite resources are available to assist with the process.
Feature Overview
With PRT Collection, admins and TAC engineers have the flexibility in collecting logs from customer devices, which should improve our time to resolution on customer cases. This allows admins, who may not be on location with the phone, the ability to provide the resources when needed. The Technical Assistance Center engineer may need newer logs, requiring user intervention again. The Technical Assistance Center can collect logs via helpdesk, to aid in resolving cases.
