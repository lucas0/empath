To specify the quality of the color that is used to display shared applications, choose one of the following:
256 colors: Specifies that a shared application or desktop appears in 256 colors in the viewer or the support representative's or customer's screen.

Thus, this option is useful if a customer is using a dial-up connection to attend a support session.

  If this option is selected, select the Screen Sampling display mode as the default mode for your site.
A support representative can change the display mode during a support session, by selecting the Session tab on the CSR Dashboard, and then selecting Session Options.
High color (16 bit): Specifies that a shared application or desktop appears in 16-bit color in the viewer or the support representative's or customer's screen. This option requires more bandwidth than the 256 color option, but provides better imaging quality.
