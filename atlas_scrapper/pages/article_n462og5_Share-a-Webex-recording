Share a Webex recording
Send a recording link to people who couldn't attend a meeting, webinar, event, or training session that you hosted or cohosted and recorded. Use email to send the link to all participants and invitees, to specific people, or generate a link to share publicly.

  If you don't include a public link, viewers need to sign in toUser Hub with their Webex account to view the recording.
Cohosts can record and share links to their recordings in Webex version 42.11 and later.
