Webex App | Get back to your call or meeting window after multitasking
Sometimes it’s difficult to find the active call or meeting window when you’re multitasking. When the window is minimized or covered up by other applications, a floating mini window appears on top of the other applications that you have open.
To bring back the full call or meeting window, click anywhere in the floating mini window.

  You can mute or unmute yourself, stop or start your video, share content, and end or leave the meeting from the floating mini window. If the floating window is covering up something on your screen, drag the window to a different location or collapse the window.
If you don't want the floating mini window to show when you're multitasking, you can turn it off.
