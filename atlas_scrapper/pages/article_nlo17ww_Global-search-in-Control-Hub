Global search in Control Hub
Use at least three letters to search for your users, groups, devices, workspaces, or settings.
The global search is always present in the Control Hub interface. Simply enter at least three letters of an object or setting that you want to find, and click the search button.
Control Hub looks for matches among your organization's users, groups, devices, and workspaces. It also looks for settings, which should help you find settings that you don't often use.
