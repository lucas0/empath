Review and manage meeting transcripts created by Webex Assistant for Meetings
If the host recorded the meeting or webinar, a transcript is generated from the recording after the meeting or webinar ends. The host can share the transcript with others and give them either view-only or edit privileges.
Webex Assistant is available in Meetings and Webex Webinars (not available for webinars in webcast view).
In addition to Meetings and Webinars, with the 41.7 update, Webex Assistant is also available for the Webex App. Meetings started or joined from a space don't support Webex Assistant.
Webex for Government doesn't support Webex Assistant.
This feature requires Cisco Webex video platform version 2.0 with joining meetings from video systems enabled. To find out which version youâ€™re using, see Find your Webex Meetings version number.
Hosts can turn on or turn off the Webex Assistant during the meeting or webinar. To automatically turn on the Webex Assistant whenever you start a meeting or webinar, see Set your Webex Meetings scheduling preferences.
Webex site admins are able to turn off automatic post-meeting emails to prevent cluttering inboxes. To turn these post-meeting emails on or off, contact your Webex site admin.
