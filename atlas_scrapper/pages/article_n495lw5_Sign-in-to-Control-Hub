Sign in to Control Hub
Use Control Hub to manage your users, services, and devices. After your organization is created, you receive an email that provides you access to manage your organization and instructions for setting it up.
Click the Get Started link using Chrome or Firefox to access Control Hub. Your administrator email address is automatically used to sign in and you're prompted to create your Webex administrator password.

  If you are deploying Webex Meetings in Control Hub, users in your organization can start using their Webex Meetings site with the default options when users are imported into Control Hub.
To access the Webex Meetings configurations and change the default options in Control Hub:
Sign in to Control Hub, then under Services, select Meeting.
Select the Webex site for which you want to change the settings, and click Configure Site.
