Webex App | Choose the skin tone for meeting reactions
For reactions that use hand gestures in meetings, such as clapping hands, choose the skin tone that you prefer.
The skin tone that you choose is used in your reactions in meetings, and when you raise your hand in a meeting. The skin tone that you choose doesn't apply to face emoji reactions.

  Linux users can see skin tones for gesture reactions from other people in Webex App, but can't currently choose a skin tone from their settings.
To change skin tones for emoji reactions in messages, see Webex App | Add emoji reactions to messages.
