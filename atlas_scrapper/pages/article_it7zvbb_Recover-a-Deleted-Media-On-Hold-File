Recover a Deleted Media On Hold File
You can recover a file if you accidentally delete it from your Media Manager in Cisco Webex Control Hub. However once you've removed it from your trash folder, you can no longer recover the file.
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Services > Call > Settings, scroll to Company Media On Hold, and then click Media Manager.
2
Go to your trash folder, choose the file you want to recover, and then click recover.
