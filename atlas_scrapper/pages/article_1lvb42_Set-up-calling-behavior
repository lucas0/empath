Set up calling behavior
Control which calling application opens when users make the calls from the Webex App. You can configure the client's calling settings, including mixed-mode deployment for organizations with users entitled with Unified CM, Webex Calling, and users without paid calling services from Cisco.
Depending upon the user’s calling license, the calling behavior options can be set up.
For Unified CM licensed users, you can set up to make calls directly from the Cisco Jabber or through the Webex App, and choose the domain (organization domain or UC Manager profile) that gets applied to the users. You can configure the settings at organization level, group level, and user level.
For users without paid calling services from Cisco, you can set up third-party applications to initiate calls. By default, all calls through the Webex App use "Call on Webex" option. You can configure the settings at the organization level.
For Webex Calling licensed users, the Webex App is the default calling application to make calls. Hence, no specific calling behavior configuration is needed.
Enable calling behavior settings at the organization level
The settings configured at the organization level automatically apply to all users under the organization.
1
Log in to Control Hub at https://admin.webex.com
2
Go to Services > Calling > Client Settings.
3
Go to Calling Behavior section and set the calling behavior options for Unified CM Users and Users without Paid Calling Services from Cisco.
For Unified CM Users:
Select Use the email domain of the user to apply your organization's domain (default option) to all Unified CM users in Webex App, or select the Use UC Manager Profile for calling and choose a created UC Manager profile from the dropdown.
Select the Open Cisco Jabber from the Webex app check box if the organization uses the Jabber app for calling. Unified CM users can make calls directly in Cisco Jabber or through Webex. When users make call in Webex App, the Cisco Jabber app launches and is used to make the call.
For Users without Paid Calling Services from Cisco:
Select Open third-party app from Webex check box to allow all the users to make calls through a third-party app, even if they haven't enabled calling in Webex. When users make call in Webex App, the third-party app is launched and used to make the call.
Enable calling behavior settings at the group level
You can enable unified CM calling behavior organization settings for a user-group through a Calling template. You can create a template and assign to the user-group. The configuration in the template applies to all users in the group.

To apply an existing template to a user-group:
Few pointers to consider when applying the Calling templates:
When a user is on boarded to an organization, the user inherits the settings from the organization-level.
If the user is added to a user-group, then the settings from the Calling template apply.
If a user belongs to multiple user-groups, then the template with the highest rank (Rank 1) takes the highest precedence and that template settings apply.
If the user has individual user settings, then these settings take precedence over user-group or organization-level settings.
See Configure settings templates for more information about managing your templates.
You can apply the existing template either from Group section or Calling section.
To apply template from Group section, see: Configure settings template.
To apply from the Calling section, perform the following steps:
