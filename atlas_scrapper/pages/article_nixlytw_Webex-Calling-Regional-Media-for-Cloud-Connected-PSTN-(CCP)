Webex Calling Regional Media for Cloud Connected PSTN (CCP)
If you are a large enterprise deployment, such as a multinational customer, Webex Calling Regional Media lets you use local data centers for PSTN calls. If your PSTN provider is connected to your local region, then regional media for CCP routes your PSTN traffic locally, resulting in improved call quality. If your PSTN provider is not connected to your local region, your PSTN traffic is routed to your organizationâ€™s home region.
Webex Calling Regional Media for CCP does not apply to Webex room systems.
You must first meet the network requirements as set by Cisco. To avoid a service outage, we recommend that you update your network, as necessary. For reference see Network Requirements for Webex Services.
Available for:
Webex Calling for Service Providers (SP)
Webex Calling for Value Added Resellers (VAR)
The following regions are combined into one Production Port Reference table for SPs and VARs:
