Schedule and join meetings with Webex for Google Workspace
The Webex integration for Google Workspace lets users schedule Webex meetings and Webex Personal Room meetings directly from Google Calendar or Gmail, in any browser. The calendar invite shows the Webex meeting details, including a link to join the meeting.
This feature is available for Webex Meetings.

If you already installed the Webex app, you'll be upgraded to a new version automatically. We recommend that IT administrators go to the Google Admin console and grant new scopes to provide organization-wide permission, otherwise users will be asked to authorize new permissions when they try to schedule Webex meetings. To grant new scopes, sign in to the Google Admin console and go to Apps > Marketplace Apps > Settings for Cisco Webex and click Revoke data access and then click Grant data access.
