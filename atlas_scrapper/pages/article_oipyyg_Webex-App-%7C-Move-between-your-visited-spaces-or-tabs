Webex App | Move between your visited spaces or tabs
You can use the arrows in the app header to move back and forward between spaces and tabs you've previously visited.
There can be times when you will need to move from space to space, or tab to tab, and it can then be difficult to get back to where you were. The forward and back arrows in the app header let you quickly take a step back or jump forward, making it easy to revisit previously visited spaces.
1
Go to the app header:
Click Back to go back to previous spaces or tabs that you’ve visited.
Click Forward to move forward through spaces or tabs that you’ve visited.
2
Click and hold Back or Forward to view a history of the spaces or tabs that you've visited.
