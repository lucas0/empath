Webex App | Access messages after the meeting
If your organization saves meeting messages, after a meeting ends, the meeting conversation is closed but the messages are saved with the meeting content. Revisit the chat or share it with others.
This feature is available on our Video Mesh-ready meeting platform. Find out if your meetings use the Video Mesh-ready meeting platform.
Hosts of scheduled meetings (not associated with a space) and Personal Room meetings can access the meeting messages after the meeting ends. If hosts have Messaging enabled, they can forward the messages to another person or space.
All members of the space can access and forward meeting messages, even if they weren't invited or didn't attend the meeting. As the host, if you prefer, you can remove access to the meeting messages. After the meeting ends, delete the message in the space that contains the link to the chat messages. The host can still access the messages from Meetings > Meeting content.
You can forward messages to people or spaces in your organization only.
