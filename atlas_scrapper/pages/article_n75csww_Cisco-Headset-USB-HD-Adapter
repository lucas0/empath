In this article
Get to know how to and use and pair your Cisco Headset USB HD Adapter.
Use the Cisco Headset USB HD Adapter
Your Cisco wireless headset comes with a USB adapter for a quick plug-and-play experience. You can also use the adapter with call devices that don't have a Bluetooth® option. The USB HD Adapter comes out of the box pre-paired to your headset. The adapter automatically connects to your headset when plugged into a powered USB port.
When you want to disconnect your headset, simply unplug the adapter from the call device. It takes about 10 minutes for your headset to accept another active Bluetooth connection after you disconnect the USB HD Adapter. You can also turn off your headset then on again to pair a new device quickly.

You can't install firmware updates to your headset through the USB HD Adapter.
1
Plug in your USB HD Adapter to your preferred device.
2
Turn on your headset.
3
Select Cisco USB HD Adapter from your device list.
