Port Reference Information for Webex Calling
This article is for network administrators, particularly firewall, and proxy security administrators who use Webex Calling services within their organization. It describes the network requirements and lists the addresses, ports, and protocols used for connecting your phones, the Webex App, and the gateways to Webex Calling services.
A correctly configured firewall and proxy are essential for a successful calling deployment. Webex Calling uses SIP and HTTPS for call signaling and the associated addresses and ports for media, network connection, and gateway connectivity as Webex Calling is a global service.
Not all firewall configurations require ports to be open. However, if you're running inside-to-outside rules, you must open ports for the required protocols to let out services.
Network Address Translation (NAT)
Network Address Translation or Port Address Translation functionality is applied at the border between two networks to translate address spaces, or to prevent the collision of IP address spaces.
If deploying NAT, it’s not mandatory to open an inbound port on the firewall.
Define reasonable binding periods and avoid manipulating SIP on the NAT device.
Configure a minimum NAT timeout to ensure proper operation of devices. Example: Cisco phones send follow-up REGISTER refresh message every 1-2 minutes.
If your network implements NAT or SPI, then set a larger timeout (of at least 30 minutes) for the connections. This timeout allows reliable connectivity while reducing the battery consumption of the users' mobile devices.
SIP Application Layer Gateway
If a router or firewall is SIP Aware, that is the SIP Application Layer Gateway (ALG) or similar is enabled, we recommend that you turn off this functionality to maintain correct operation of service.
Check the relevant manufacturer's documentation for steps to disable SIP ALG on specific devices.
Proxy support for Webex Calling
Organizations deploy an internet firewall or internet proxy and firewall, to inspect, restrict, and control the HTTP traffic that leaves and enters their network. Thus protecting their network from various forms of cyberattacks.
Proxies perform several security functions such as:
Allow or block access to specific URLs.
User authentication
IP address/domain/hostname/URI reputation lookup
Traffic decryption and inspection
On configuring the proxy feature, it applies to all the applications that use the HTTP's protocol.
The applications include the following:
Webex Services
Customer device activation (CDA) procedures using Cisco Cloud provisioning platform such as GDS, EDOS device activation, provisioning & onboarding to Webex cloud.
Certificate Authentication
Firmware Upgrades
Status Reports
PRT Uploads
XSI Services

If a proxy server address is configured, then only the Signaling traffic (HTTP/HTTPS) is sent to the proxy server. Clients that use SIP to register to the Webex Calling service and the associated media aren’t sent to the proxy. Therefore, allow these clients to go through the firewall directly.
Supported Proxy Options, configuration & Authentication types
The supported proxy types are:
Explicit Proxy (inspecting or noninspecting)—Configure the clients either App or Device with explicit proxy to specify the server to use. This option supports one of the following authentication types:
Transparent Proxy (noninspecting)—The Clients aren’t configured to use a specific proxy server address and don’t require any changes to work with a noninspecting proxy.
Transparent Proxy (inspecting)—The Clients aren’t configured to use a specific proxy server address. No HTTP's configuration changes are necessary; however, your clients either App or Devices need a root certificate so that they trust the proxy. The IT team uses the inspecting proxies to enforce policies on the websites to visit and the types of content that aren’t permitted.
Configure the proxy addresses manually for Webex Room devices, Cisco IP Multiplatform Phones (MPP), and Webex App using:
Platform OS
Device UI
Automatic discovery
While configuring, choose from the following Proxy configurations & authentication types:

For legends in the table:
†Mac NTLM Auth - Machine need not be logged on to the domain, user prompted for a password
†Windows NTLM Auth - Supported only if a machine is logged onto the domain
Web Proxy Auto Discovery (WPAD) - See Web Proxy Auto Discovery Protocol for details.
Proxy Auto Config (PAC) files - See Proxy Auto-Config Files for details.
To connect Cisco Webex Board, Desk, or Room Series device to a proxy server, see Connect your Board, Desk, or Room Series device to a proxy server.
For Cisco IP phones, see Set Up a Proxy Server as an example for configuring the proxy server and settings.

For No Authentication, configure the client with a proxy address that doesn’t support authentication. When using Proxy Authentication, configure with valid credentials. Proxies that inspect web traffic may interfere with web socket connections. If this problem occurs, bypassing the not inspecting traffic to *.Webex.com might solve the problem. If you already see other entries, add a semicolon after the last entry, and then enter the Webex exception.
Proxy settings for Windows OS
Microsoft Windows support two network libraries for HTTP traffic (WinINet and WinHTTP) that allow Proxy configuration.WinINet is a superset of WinHTTP.
WinInet is designed for single-user, desktop client applications only
WinHTTP is designed primarily for multiuser, server-based applications
When selecting between the two, choose WinINet for your proxy configuration settings. For details, see wininet-vs-winhttp.
Refer to Configure a list of allowed domains to access Webex while on your corporate network for details on the following:
To ensure that people only sign in to applications using accounts from a predefined list of domains.
Use a proxy server to intercept requests and limit the domains that are allowed.
Proxy Inspection and Certificate Pinning
The Webex App and Devices validate the certificates of the servers when they establish the TLS sessions. Certificate checks that such as the certificate issuer and digital signature rely on verifying the chain of certificates up to the root certificate. To perform the validation checks, the Webex App and Devices use a set of trusted root CA certificates installed in the operating system trust store.
If you have deployed a TLS-inspecting Proxy to intercept, decrypt and inspect Webex Calling traffic. Ensure that the certificate the Proxy presents (in lieu of the Webex service certificate) is signed by a certificate authority, and the root certificate is installed in the trust store of your Webex App or Webex device.
For Webex App - Install the CA certificate that is used to sign the certificate by the proxy in the operating system of the device.
For Webex Room devices and Cisco multiplatform IP Phones - Open a service request with TAC team to install the CA certificate.

Firewall Configuration
Cisco supports Webex Calling and Webex Aware services in secure Cisco and Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centers. Amazon has reserved its IP subnets for Cisco’s sole use, and secured the services located in these subnets within the AWS virtual private cloud.
Configure your firewall to allow communication from your devices, applications, and internet-facing services to perform their functions properly. This configuration allows access to all the supported Webex Calling and Webex Aware cloud services, domain names, IP addresses, Ports, and protocols.
Whitelist or open access to the following so that the Webex Calling and Webex Aware services function correctly.
The URLs/Domains mentioned under the section Domains and URLs for Webex Calling Services
IP subnets, Ports, and Protocols mentioned under the section IP Subnets for Webex Calling Services
If you're using the Webex meetings, messaging, and other services then ensure you have the Domains/URLs mentioned in this article are also open Network Requirements for Webex Services
If you are using a firewall only, then filtering Webex Calling traffic using IP addresses alone is not supported as the IP address pools are dynamic and may change at any time. Update your rules regularly, failing to update your firewall rules list could impact your users' experience. Cisco doesn’t endorse filtering a subset of IP addresses based on a particular geographic region or cloud service provider. Filtering by region can cause severe degradation to your calling experience.
If your firewall doesn’t support Domain/URL filtering, then use an Enterprise Proxy server option. This option filters/allows by URL/domain the HTTPs signaling traffic to Webex Calling and Webex Aware services in your Proxy server, before forwarding to your firewall.
For Webex Calling, UDP is Cisco’s preferred transport protocol for media, and it recommends using only SRTP over UDP. TCP and TLS as transport protocols for media are not supported for Webex Calling in production environments. This is because the connection-orientated nature of these protocols affects media quality over lossy networks. If you have queries regarding the transport protocol, raise a support ticket.
