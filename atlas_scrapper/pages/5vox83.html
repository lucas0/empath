Allow video systems to join meetings and events on your Webex site
Webex Meetings users and Webex Events panelists can join meetings from video systems. Site administrators must first allow this feature for individual host accounts.
Site Administration
Control Hub
Enable Collaboration Meeting Rooms for Host accounts
You can turn on Collaboration Meeting Rooms so that people can join from their video systems.

Only Webex Meetings users and Webex Events panelists can join through a video system.

Video systems can't join Webex Events on the FedRAMP platform, because the FedRAMP platform is running Video Platform 1.
1
Sign in to Site Administration, go to User Management > Edit User, and select a user.

Under the Privileges section, check Collaboration Meeting Room.

Select Update.
Specify Collaboration Meeting Room options

Webex meetings are encrypted. Attendees who connect to Webex meetings with encrypted room and desk devices remain secure. They aren't affected by attendees who connect with unencrypted room and desk devices.
1
Sign in to Webex Site Administration and go to Configuration > Common Site settings > Options.
2
In the Cloud Collaboration Meeting Room Options, check Use a pilot number to configure a numeric dial string that appears in meeting invitation emails, for example, <meeting_number>@webex.com.
If you leave this option unchecked, users join meetings and panelists join events by dialing a system-generated, site-specific pilot URL that appears in the email invitation.
3
Set the pilot number by modifying the text box.
New or updated pilot numbers must exactly match the chosen number.

Enable video call-bacbk
You can enable video call-back to make it easier for Webex Meetings users and Webex Events panelists to join from video systems.
Webex Meetings mobile application users can join a meeting by tapping a button on their smartphone or tablet (iOS and Android).
Desktop meetings users and event panelists can receive a video call on their video systems, similar to audio call-back.
Before you begin
Configure your Webex site with either Webex Audio or Cloud Connected Audio.
1
On the left navigation bar, select Configuration > Common Site Settings > Options.
2
In the Cloud Collaboration Meeting Rooms Options section, check the Enable Video call-back check box.
3
Choose whether users must press 1 to join meetings or events:
without pressing "1"
must press "1"

  Users on the Webex Meetings application version 39.8 and later can choose to connect their video system with or without pressing 1 themselves under Preferences > Video system > Call my video system.
