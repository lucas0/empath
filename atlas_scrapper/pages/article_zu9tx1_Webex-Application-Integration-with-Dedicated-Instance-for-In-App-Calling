Webex Application Integration with Dedicated Instance for In-App Calling
Overview of Calling from Webex Application in Dedicated Instance Solution
Integrating calling from Webex Application with the Dedicated Instance solution enhances the calling experience, enabling end users to:
Make calls directly from the Webex Application through the Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM)
Use mid-call features
Integrating calling enables registration of the Webex Application directly to the Unified CM call control environment in Dedicated Instance.
When dialing from the Webex Application, users can use the same dial strings or prefixes as they do on their desk phones. The Webex Application functions like any other desk phone registered to Unified CM. Unified CM calls that are established in Webex Application uses the configuration (location, bandwidth settings, point to point media, and so forth) that is in place for the Unified CM deployment.
In softphone mode, the Webex Application registers as a SIP device with the product type "Cisco Unified Client Services Framework" or CSF for desktop, TCT or BOT for mobile, and TAB for tablets. Alternatively, the Webex Application can connect to the Unified CM using CTI to control the user's endpoints.
Integration Methods
There are two methods of registering Webex Application for calling in Unified CM, through direct peering and through Mobile and Remote Access (MRA).
Direct Peering. Integrate Webex Application with Unified CM over the direct peering established to Dedicated Instance and enable Cisco Unified CM for Calling (Webex for Messaging and Meetings).
MRA. Integrate Webex Application with Unified CM in Dedicated Instance and enable Cisco Unified CM for Calling (Webex for Messaging and Meetings), using MRA to register the Webex Application.
When registered over MRA, integration also can support the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol. Cisco Unified CM makes use of Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN) and Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) to optimize the media path of MRA calls.
Before you begin
Before you can integrate a Webex Application into the Dedicated Instance, perform these procedures.
Sync users from the Active Directory (AD) to Control Hub and edit the licenses
Configure single sign-on (SSO) in Control Hub (Optional), so that users will authenticate through the enterprise identity provider.
Install the latest Webex Application on the end-user’s Windows or Mac device(s).
Ensure that the Windows or Mac end-user device has connectivity to the internet (direct or through Proxy) for user authentication of the Webex Application.
To support secure registration and Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) for the Webex Application, enable SIP OAuth across all applications, including Unified CM, Cisco Unity Connection, and Expressway.

Beginning with the 12.5 Webex Application release, the client does not support Certificate Authority Proxy Function (CAPF).
Configuration for Webex Application Integration
Configure Cisco Unified CM
This section identifies the unique configuration required for integration of Webex application with Dedicated Instance solution.
In Unified CM, navigate to User Management > End Users, make sure the User’s email ID is configured. The User’s email ID configured in the Cisco Unified CM should be the same as the one configured in the Control Hub.
Under the user's Service Settings, check the Home Cluster checkbox.
Create the following device type in the Cisco Unified CM, based on from which device the User signs in to the Webex application:
Android Device (BOT)
Chromebook/iPad Devices (TAB)
Windows/MAC Devices (CSF)
iPhone Device (TCT)
Associate the User and the device created above.
If CTI is needed for desk-phone control, assign the appropriate roles to the end user.
Configure Webex Control Hub
Log into Webex Control Hub as an administrator.
Navigate to Organization Settings > UC Manager Profiles in the Webex Control Hub window.

In UC Manager Profile, the domain configured in the “Voice Service Domain” should be the Voice Service Domain provided by Cisco for that specific Dedicated Instance Region.
Configure the “Calling Behavior” to “Calling in Webex (Unified CM)” from:
Organization Settings > Calling Behavior
Users > Calling > Calling Behavior
Choose the UC Manager Profile created above.
Refer to Manage and Troubleshoot Calling in Webex (Unified CM) for troubleshooting and management information for calling from a webex application.

Call Pickup
If a user is in a customer support role and their coworker isn't able to answer an incoming call to their phone, the support user gets a notification in Webex App if both are in the same pickup group. That user can answer their call from the notification in the app. The user can also pick up the calls in other pickup groups. See Pick Up Someone Else's Call.
✓
✓
Call Recording
You can determine how much control users have over recording calls. Depending on the setup, incoming and outgoing calls may be recorded automatically or you may be able to decide which calls you want to record. If you enable users with call recording, they can start and stop recordings at their own discretion. When a call is being recorded, that recording continues whether a user moves the call to another device, merges the call with another active call, or makes a conference call. They're presented with a visual indicator letting them know when a call is being recorded. See Record Your Phone Calls.
✓
✓
Call Waiting
When a user is already in call and someone else calls, the called user can choose how they want to handle the incoming call. For example, the user can put the active call on hold and answer the second call. See Answer Call Waiting for more information.
✓
✓
Conference calls
When users are on a call with someone else, they might want to add other people into the call to start a conference call right away. They can add up to 8 other people into conference calls started in this way. See Start a Conference Call.
✓
✓
Control Your Video Device from the App
Users can start or stop sharing your video on a connected video device right from the app. For example, if connected to a Cisco Webex Board and users don't want to share video, they no longer have to walk up to the board and turn off the video. They can turn it off from the app. See Turn Off Your Video During a Meeting or Call On Webex Boards, Room and Desk Devices.
✓
Hold/resume
Users place a call on hold and resume in Webex App. See Put a Phone Call On Hold.
✓
✓
Hunt Groups
Users can sign in or out of a Hunt Group from Call Settings. When they're signed in and a call comes into a group that they belong to, they'll see the Hunt Group number on the incoming call notification. Sign in to a Hunt Group.
✓
✓
Merge
Users take 2 active calls and merge them into a single conference call in Webex App. See Merge Two Phone Calls.
✓
✓
Mirror self-view
Mirror self-view—By default, when users share video during a call, they can see themselves just like you're looking in a mirror. If they text behind them and want to read it easily instead of having to read it backwards, tehey may want to off the Mirror my video view setting. This setting doesn't affect the way other people in the meeting see you. See Turn Off Mirror View for Your Self-View Video..
✓
✓
Move a call into a meeting
Users in a call can take advantage of advanced meetings features such as transcriptions, real-time translations, notes, action items, recordings, and whiteboarding. Just move that call into a full-featured meeting. Before moving the call into a meeting, users can even invite other people into the discussion.
✓
✓
Multiline
Users can use up to 8 phone lines with Webex App and leverage advanced calling features on each line such as call forward, transfer, hunt group, shared lines, and voicemail. They can also assign different ringtones to each line. And you can turn on presence for shared lines so that line status is displayed for users. See Change the Active Line for Calling.
✓
Park and retrieve calls
Users can park a call on one device and that user or someone else can retrieve the call from another device.
✓
✓
Resume from different devices
A user can put a call on hold from the desktop app and resume it on mobile. Or, put your mobile call on hold and resume it on a desk phone. Go any direction between desk phone, mobile, and desktop; just put the call on hold and resume wherever it's convenient. See Put a Phone Call On Hold.
✓
✓
Screen sharing
Screen sharing—Share content from a computer screen during a call in Webex App. Users can choose a specific application to share, rather than having to share their whole screen. If a user answers on desk phone, a screen share is still possible. The phone user sees the shared screen from the phone if it supports video, otherwise they'll see the shared screen from the app. See Share Your Screen in a Phone Call.

  Users can share your screen regardless of whether the person they called is using a cloud-registered device or an on-premises device. The screen share is still sent with a high frame rate (30 FPS), high resolution (1080p), and includes audio.
✓
Switch between front and back cameras
On mobile phones or tablets, you can switch between front-facing and back-facing cameras. See the mobile sections in Change Your Video Settings.
✓
Transfer
Redirects a connected call within Webex App. The target is the user to which another user wants to transfer the call. See Transfer a Phone Call.
✓
✓
Virtual cameras
During a call, users can choose to use a virtual camera. Use a virtual camera, such as an application, driver, or software, to create an overlay of video, images, or feeds.

Mobile
Add a Pause to Dial String
Users can add a pause to an entered phone number, which they might need if joining a conference call and need to enter numbers in response to the automated system. They can add a comma (,) to the number, which gives a 1-second delay in the dialing. They can add several commas in a row to extend the delay. For example: 95556543123,,,,56789.
✓
✓
Add Contacts, Search Your Contacts, and Make a Call
Users can add coworkers into a Contacts list and group them however they like, making people easier to find when users need to chat or call.
Users can even look up Outlook contacts (Windows), local address book (Mac), and local phone contacts (iPhone, iPad, and Android) from Webex App, so they can easily find contacts and make a call.
When you add your coworker to your Contacts list, you can edit their profile and add additional phone numbers for them. Then, you'll see the new phone number when you make an audio or video call, so it's easier to call them at their alternative number. See Add Someone to Your Contacts List.
✓
✓
Automatic Gain Control (AGC)
AGC is a unique circuit that listens to the incoming audio level and adjusts the recording level when sounds are too loud or too soft. When the audio volume is too loud, it automatically reduces the sound. When the audio is too soft, it automatically amplifies the sound. This doesn't adjust the audio volume at the OS level.
✓
✓
Call on Webex App
Users can choose whether to call people using their phone number or using a call in Webex App. A call in Webex App is a quick way to call someone else who's using Webex App. Users can share their screen and whiteboard while in the call, but they can't put the call on hold, transfer the call, or use other features only available in phone calls. See Call Anyone with a Webex App account.

  Users only have access to the dial pad if they have a paid calling license. If they have a free calling license, they can still call other Webex App users.
✓
✓
Call control for calls in Webex App
If using a Cisco 730 headset, users can use its USB adapter or Bluetooth to answer and end calls, put calls on hold and resume them, as well as mute and unmute calls. See Make and Answer Calls on the Cisco Headset 730.
✓
Call history
When a user calls other people in the organization, they see more details about phone numbers in the call history. So, to call someone back, that user can see if they're calling a work or mobile number.
Users can select the Call icon beside someone’s name or number in their Call History and automatically call the person back at the number in the history. Users no longer need to choose what number to reach others at. After they return a missed call, they can delete the call from call history. The call history only shows the last 200 calls over the last 30 days. See View Call and Meeting History for more information.
✓
✓
Call Statistics
When users are in a call, they can check call statistics, such as packet loss, latency, and resolution rate. See Access Call Statistics.
✓
Click to Call from Outlook
You can set up your Windows or Mac computer so that Webex App is the default option for calling numbers that you click outside of the app, for example, in Microsoft Outlook or from a link in your web browser. See Click to Call From Another App.
✓
Client Matter Codes (CMCs) and Forced Authorization Codes (FMCs)
With client matter codes (CMCs) and forced authorization codes (FACs), you can effectively manage call access and accounting. CMCs assist with call accounting and billing for clients, and FACs regulate the types of calls that certain users can place.
CMCs force the user to enter a code; this action specifies that the call relates to a specific client matter. You can assign client matter codes to customers, students, or other populations for call accounting and billing purposes. FACs force the user to enter a valid authorization code that is assigned at a certain access level before the call is completed. See the "Prepare Your Environment" chapter.
✓
✓
Contact Center Integration
Webex App can integrate into your Cisco Contact Center application and be controlled in Finesse desktop (Unified Contact Center Enterprise or Express). This integration supports contact center features such as multiline, recording, conferencing, and more. See Contact Center Integration for the latest supported features.
✓
Diagnostics in the Webex App
If users experience connection issues, they can use the diagnostic tool to identify configuration errors or export a network diagnostics report. This information helps you troubleshoot any issues they're experiencing. See the Troubleshooting chapter.
✓
Dial-via-Office (DVO)
When you set up users with DVO, they have the option to make work calls using their mobile phone connection, which ensures calls are uninterrupted even if data is unavailable. No matter what option they choose, the work number is always used as the caller ID so people can easily identify users. See Make Work Calls Over a Mobile Phone Connection.
✓
Dial Plan Mapping
You configure dial plan mapping to ensure that dialing rules on Cisco Unified Communications Manager match dialing rules on your directory. See the Prepare Your Environment chapter.
✓
✓
Emergency calls
If users make an emergency call in Webex App, the call is made using the device’s Phone app, making it easier for Emergency Services to pinpoint a location through their network carrier.
✓
Extend and Connect
You can set up users to connect to alternate devices to make and receive calls. Users can see those devices under Alternate Devices when they go to calling settings. That's where they can add or edit the phone numbers for those devices. See Make a Call From an Alternate Device.
✓
Fast failover (MRA)
Webex application can detect failure quickly, whether it's a controlled shutdown, node failure, or network failure, and seamlessly fail over to a backup path through MRA so user productivity isn't affected. See the Prepare Your Environment chapter.
✓
✓
Health Checker for Phone Services Status
If unsure whether Phone Service is working properly, users can check out the status of the phone connection from the app. On Windows, they click their profile picture and then go to Help > Health Checker. On Mac, they go to Help > Health Checker. Health Checker tests the connection and lets users know if there's a problem.
✓
High Definition (HD) Video
Users can enable or disable HD video by clicking their profile picture, going to Settings (Windows) or Preferences (Mac), selecting Video, and then enabling or disabling the setting. They may want to disable HD video if their computer CPU is running high or they want to save network bandwidth during a call or meeting.
✓
Location Monitoring
You can turn on location monitoring so that when users call emergency services from Webex application (for example, 911), their location is automatically shared with emergency responders.
✓
✓
Missed calls
See how many calls you’ve missed with a red badge counter in the Calls tab. The Calls tab shows a list of incoming and outgoing calls and you can call someone back from your Call History. Your scheduled meetings are listed in the Meetings tab, making it easier for you to distinguish between the two types of communication.
✓
More calling options
Users can call someone's video address (for example, bburke@biotechnia.com) from anywhere in the app where they'd make any type of call (example: search for someone or being in a space with that person).
✓
Network Handoff (Wi-Fi to LTE)
When you're on an active call and you need to change networks but want to keep the call in Webex, no need to worry; the change is made automatically without any interruption or effect to call quality. (See Unified CM features in Prepare Your Environment.)
