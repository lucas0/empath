Webex App | Space policy
When you post messages, share files, and create whiteboards in Webex App, your content belongs to the company that owns the space. You can find who owns the space, what information they keep, and other details if you select View Space Policy for each space.
In group spaces, if the person who created a space leaves the organization, the organization will continue to own the space and retention policy as long as it still has people in the space. In conversations with just one other person, the organization that each person belongs to owns their employee's content.
The policy defines:
who owns the content posted in the space.
how long the content is stored for. After this time is up, all content is gone for good and is irretrievable.
that the owner of the space may monitor and delete content based on its policies.
