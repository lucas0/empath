Manage call recording for Webex Calling
In this article
You may want to record the calls that are made and received by certain users or virtual lines for various reasons, such as quality assurance, security, or training. Calls made to and received on a desk phone, analog telephone adapters, or the Webex App are recorded using third-party call recording providers. As an administrator, you can allow the call recording providers to record all incoming and outgoing calls for specific users or virtual lines in your organization. We support On-demand recording, Always, and Always with Pause/Resume recording modes.

Dubber Go is available to all users and Control Hub has integration with Dubber to automatically provision a Dubber account. When users are enabled for call recording, Dubber accounts are provisioned automatically if the organization doesn’t have a Dubber account. The users and the Dubber go entitlements are also automatically provisioned in the Dubber account.
To get advanced features, you can update Dubber user entitlements from a free to a paid subscription. You can downgrade from a paid to a free subscription at any time. To do so, identify the users who require entitlement changes and contact your partner. A user who is an administrator in the Dubber account can also make the above changes.

What to do next
You can enable compliance call recording announcement settings at organization level and location level for PSTN calls. For more information, see Enable compliance call recording announcement section.
Enable compliance call recording announcement
You can enable the compliance announcement settings separately for inbound and outbound PSTN calls. Once enabled, when the PSTN call is made or received, the caller (PSTN user) will hear the announcement “This call may be recorded” only once at the beginning of the call. The recording starts after the user, who has call recording enabled, answers the call. Once the compliance announcement is played, the start/stop recording announcements are suppressed for the Webex Calling user. Even when mid-call operations such as transfer are initiated on that call, announcements aren’t played multiple times. However, the visual indicator is displayed in the Webex App or on supported phones to indicate that the call is being recorded.
If a call comes directly to a user, the compliance announcement is played in the language that is set for the user in the User > Calling > Announcement Language. If a call comes directly to an Auto Attendant, Call Queue or Hunt Group, the compliance announcement is played in the language that is set for the Auto Attendant, Call Queue or Hunt Group in the Calling > Features > Auto Attendant/Call Queue/Hunt Group > General Settings > Language. The list of supported languages can be found in the respective setting's drop-down. If a call comes directly to a virtual line, the compliance announcement is played in the language that is set for the virtual line in the Calling > Virtual Lines > select a virtual line > Calling > Announcement Language.
The compliance announcement audio doesn’t get recorded in the recording. However, if the call was recorded, the metadata sent to the call recording provider includes information about whether the compliance announcement or user announcements were played or not.
The user level announcement settings take precedence only if the compliance announcement isn’t played, and this applies only for the inbound calls. For more information, see Enable call recording for Webex Calling users section.

We recommend you enable user level announcement setting for all users who have call recording enabled. This will serve as a reliable alternative to play the regular announcements in case the compliance announcements fail to play for the inbound call.
You can enable the compliance announcement at the organization level and override at the location level.

Delay announcement —Enable the toggle to set an announcement delay time in seconds. The compliance announcement is played only after a specified delay time. This prevents the announcement from playing at the same time as a user or agent greeting the customer.

  Maximum allowed announcement delay time is 60 seconds.

Enable call recording for Webex Calling users
Before you begin
Ensure that users have Professional or Basic Webex Calling user licenses assigned.
The administrator who enables call recording in the Control Hub is also assigned the role of the administrator in the Dubber account. Further, this administrator can use the Dubber portal to add other administrators or reassign Dubber licenses.
1
Sign in to Control Hub.
2
Go to Management > Users and then select a user.
3
Select Calling, scroll to User Call Experience, and then turn on Call Recording, the user's call recording settings get cleared, however any calls that were recorded before this change are still maintained on the call recording provider platform.
For Dubber account and user provisioning are automated. The administrator who enabled the user for call recording is also added to the Dubber account as an administrator. This administrator can use the Dubber portal to add other administrators or reassign Dubber licenses.
Control Hub doesn’t automatically provision users in the call recording providers, except Dubber. Other providers may provide tools to sync users to your call recording provider account.
If a partner administrator is enabling call recording for their customers, the same partner administrator user isn’t allowed in multiple customer accounts.
4
After enabling call recording, in case the user is still having issues with recording calls you can contact the call recording providers support with the information available in the Show call recording platform information section.
It can be found from the Users page by going to Calling > User Call Experience > Call Recording > Show call recording platform information.

You can configure any of the following settings:
On Demand—Choose this option if you want to grant users control over when they can start and end recordings. You may also choose the pause and resume notification, if applicable.
Always—Choose this option if you want all incoming and outgoing calls recorded.
Always with pause/resume—Choose this option if you want to grant users control over when they can pause and resume recordings.
Never—This option is selected by default.
Record voicemail—Choose this option if you also want to read voice messages sent and received. If storage space is a concern, you may not want to select this option.
Recording start/stop announcement—Choose any of the following options to manage the audible announcement that is played when recording starts or stops for PSTN calls and internal calls.
Play recording start/stop announcement for PSTN calls—Choose this option if you want a standard announcement to be played at the beginning of all incoming and outgoing PSTN calls notifying all parties that the call is being recorded. You may require this announcement to comply with the legal requirements based on the business needs.

  If the compliance announcement is enabled at the organization or location level, the PSTN user will not hear the start/stop announcement even if you enable this option. This option takes precedence only if a PSTN call comes to or made by a user who is in an organization or location where the compliance announcement is disabled or failed to play. For more information, see Enable compliance call recording announcement section.
Play recording start/stop announcement for internal calls—Choose this option if you want a standard announcement to be played at the beginning of all incoming and outgoing internal calls notifying all parties that the call is being recorded.

  This announcement isn’t included in the recording of the call.

  When an announcement is played during start, stop, pause, or resume operations, Webex Calling sends SIPREC metadata information to the call recording provider indicating that an announcement was played. Using this information, some call recording providers have indicators to show if an announcement was played for that call.
Pause/Resume Notification—Choose this option if you want to receive pause and resume notifications. You can choose a beep option or an announcement option that plays the following:
Pause—Plays an announcement indicating that it’s paused successfully.
Resume—Plays an announcement indicating that it’s resumed successfully.

  The user level announcement settings for Pause/Resume are always played when the user initiates that action.
Repeat tone every—By default, a tone is played every 20 seconds reminding all parties that the call is being recorded. You can change this to a value 10–90 seconds.

Call recording for virtual lines
As an administrator, you can now enable call recording for the virtual lines. Virtual lines are added as additional lines on user devices such as desk phones and the Webex App. Virtual lines support all the call recording options available on the primary line of users, including visual and audio notification. Calls on the virtual lines are recorded using partner call recording services such as Dubber and Imagicle. You may need to purchase additional licenses from these call recording services to access calls recorded on virtual lines. Contact your call recording provider for more information.
Call recording is disabled by default on virtual lines. Make sure to select a call recording provider at either the organization level or the location level associated with the virtual line before enabling call recording on the virtual line.
Consider a scenario with Dubber selected as the call recording provider. If call recording is enabled for a virtual line and the assigned user doesn’t have call recording enabled, Dubber automatically creates an account for that user. To access the call recordings for a virtual line, the administrator should create a Team in the Dubber administration portal. The Dub point associated with the virtual line should be configured as a contributor for the Team. Other users who need to listen to the recordings should be configured as Listeners in that team. For more information, contact Dubber Support. If other call recording providers are used, then to access the recordings for a virtual line, refer to the appropriate call recording provider documentation or contact their Support teams.
Prerequisites
The following are some of the important points to note regarding call recording on virtual lines:
To access call recordings on virtual lines, you need additional licenses of the partner call recording services.
For the virtual line assigned to a Webex App user, currently call recording is supported in the Always recording mode. However, all the other recording modes will be available shortly.
Changing the call recording provider at organization or location level isn’t supported for virtual lines when call recording is enabled.
Enable call recording for virtual lines
To enable call recording on your virtual line from Control Hub:
1
Sign in to Control Hub.
2
Go to Services > Calling > Virtual Lines.
3
Choose the virtual line that you want to configure the settings for by clicking on it.
4
Click Calling, scroll to User Call Experience, and turn on Call Recording.

  Control Hub doesn’t automatically provision users in the Call Recording Providers, except Dubber. Other providers may provide tools to sync users to your call recording provider account.
When you turn off Call Recording, the call recording settings get cleared. However, any calls that were recorded before this change of setting is still maintained in the call recording provider platform.
5
Contact support in case the user is having issues with recording calls after you enable call recording. Support information is available as detailed for Show call recording platform information.

Call recording behaviour
Users will see an icon on their Multiplatform phone (MPP) and the Webex App showing that a call is being recorded.
Users with On-demand recording mode will be a Record soft key (button) to initiate the recording.
Users with On-demand and always with Pause/Resume will dynamically see the soft key (button) to perform this action if the settings are enabled for the users.
When a call is being recorded, dual streams are sent to Call recording provider.
When an announcement is played during start, stop, pause, or resume operations, Webex Calling sends information to the call recording provider that an announcement was played as a SIPREC meta-data message.
ICE (Media optimization) and Call Recording are both features that independently introduce a small audio delay at the beginning of the call and when used together the audio delay is slightly longer and more noticeable to customers.
