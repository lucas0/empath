Software upgrades on Board, Desk, and Room Series
When there's a new software version available for your device, the device upgrades automatically.
Your device comes with RoomOS pre-installed, and updates are installed automatically. Your device automatically checks for new updates:
First time you start it up
When you reset the device
Every 24 hours
By default, the daily updates are set to 12.00-00.30 a.m. your local time.
When there's a new software release available, it may take some days for the update to reach all devices in a distributed manner.
If someone is using the device at the scheduled time, the update takes place when it's no longer in use.
When the software update notice appears, you can:
Install the new software by selecting Upgrade now .
Postpone the installation by 6 hours by selecting Postpone .
Wait for the installation to start automatically within 1 minute.
Downloading and installing RoomOS takes about 5 minutes. If you have a slow connection, this could take longer.
If a new software version is available and you want to update the device immediately, do so from the Settings menu.
Board, Desk: swipe from the right side of the device's home screen or tap the button to open the control panel. Then tap Device Settings. Scroll to and select Software updates.
Room Series: tap the button on the controller's home screen to open the control panel. Then tap Device Settings. Scroll to and select Software updates.
