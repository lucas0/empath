Enable the Auto-Deletion policy for Webex recordings
You can set the number of days that recordings remain accessible, before Webex automatically moves them to the trash. After you set the policy, a message appears on the recording management page to notify all administrators.
Webex Control Hub
Webex Site Administration
The following procedure applies to Webex sites that you manage using Control Hub.

  New Webex accounts include a full year of unlimited recording storage. By default, the system permanently deletes recordings older than 365 days. When the system moves recordings according to the retention policy, it doesn't move them to the trash.
We recommend that you set your retention policy to keep storage below the cap for your site. Monitor your site requirements and purchase more storage if required.
When users delete their recordings, the system moves them to the trash. For up to 30 days, you can restore deleted recordings from the trash. After 30 days, the system permanently deletes the recordings.
