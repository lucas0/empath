Use Wi-Fi on Board, Desk, and Room Series
On Board, Desk, and Room Series devices, you can choose to use either a wired or a Wi-FiÂ® connection.
When wireless connection is enabled for a device, you can change between wired and Wi-Fi connection on the touch interface. To use the Wi-Fi, disconnect the Ethernet cable first.
You can connect to Wi-Fi if your network uses one of these supported authentication types:
Open
WPA2-PSK (AES)
WPA2-EAP-PEAP MSCHAPv2
WPA2-EAP-PEAP GTC
WPA2-EAP-TLS
WPA2-EAP-TTLS
WPA2-EAP-FAST

Network administrators should also read this article, for best practices to follow when configuring a Wi-Fi connection.
The wireless network must show at least three bars on the screen, for the connection to be sufficiently stable. You can't join networks that require sign-in through a landing page.
The system only remembers one network at a time. If you change between different networks, you have to type in the passphrase again.
1
Open the control panel on your device by swiping from the right or tapping the button. Then select Device Settings.
2
Scroll to Network and service and tap Network Connection .
On the next screen tap Wi-Fi . If Wi-Fi is off, tap the toggle to turn it on.
3
Select the Wi-Fi you want to connect to. If the network is hidden, tap Join other network or the gear icon in the upper right corner. You can then set up the Wi-Fi manually.
4
Type in the username and passphrase as required. Tap Connect .
5
When you're finished, tap the left arrow to go back to the Settings screen, and then tap the Close button.
Once connected, you can access the Wi-Fi settings and check the network status at any time, including during a call. Go to Settings > Network connection > Wi-Fi and then tap the connected network name. On the next screen tap Advanced Wi-Fi details to see the network's status.
