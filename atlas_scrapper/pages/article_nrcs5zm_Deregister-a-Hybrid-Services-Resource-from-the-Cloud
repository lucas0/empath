Deregister a Hybrid Services Resource from the Cloud
If you no longer want to connect your on-premises environment to any Cisco Webex Hybrid Services that you deployed, use this procedure to remove a registered resource for a specific hybrid service.
Before you begin
Any hybrid services that are running on the resource must be deactivated first.
You can only perform this procedure from Control Hub, not directly on the hybrid services resource interface.
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Services > Hybrid, click View from the On-Premises Resources card, and then click from a resource name in the list.
2
Scroll to Cluster, and then click Remove. After you read and understand the confirmation prompt and you're sure you want to proceed, click Confirm.
What to do next
You can readd a resource for hybrid services if you change your mind, but you need to reconfigure its settings and reenable Webex App users for hybrid services.
