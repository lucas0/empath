Build and Manage Digital DECT Network in Control Hub
In this article
Webex Calling provides multicell support for the Cisco IP DECT DBS-210, allowing the provisioning of up to 1000 lines across up to 254 bases. Administrators can build and manage Cisco DECT network settings within Cisco Webex Control Hub.
Get Started with Your DECT Network
The Cisco IP DECT Series consist these Cisco devices:
Cisco IP DECT DBS 110 Single-Cell Base Station
Cisco IP DECT DBS 210 Multi-Cell Base Station (up to 254 bases)
Cisco DECT Handsets (6823 and 6825)
For Webex Calling/Wholesale, these offers apply:
DBS 110 supports Single Cell deployments only with Repeaters.
DBS 210 supports Single, Dual, and Multi Cell deployments with Repeaters.
Creating a DECT network builds a virtual container to populate the various elements that make up a DECT Network. Building DECT networks allows an administrator to deploy a new DECT Network and manage existing Networks. You can migrate an existing single-cell or multi-cell networks to the new DECT network solution.
Building DECT Networks allows you to deploy both single-cell and multi-cell DECT Networks that can coexist within the same customer location.
When creating a DECT network, you can customize the network based on your deployment requirements (example: enterprise, warehouse environment, retail):
Assign users and places to a multi-cell network.
Configure multiple lines per handset.
Configure self-sufficient bases.
Group DECT base stations into DECT network
The three primary steps to creating a DECT network are:
1
Create the DECT network itself (the container that holds all bases and handsets).
2
Add base stations.
3
Assign users to handsets.
Create a New DECT Network
Before you begin
DECT Networks are configured within the DECT Network tab in Control Hub. Here you can add base stations and assign handsets to users.
You can’t mix and match 110 and 210 bases within a DECT network.
A handset can have up to two lines, and a DECT network supports a total of 120 lines across all handsets.
Building a DECT network is like building a container that holds all of your bases and handsets. A DECT Network can be created then configured (assigning users, lines) at a later time.
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Services.
2
Select Calling > Features > DECT Network.
3
When the DECT Network page appears, click Create DECT Network.

  Note: if you have an Existing Single-Cell or Multi-Cell Network, you can easily convert to a new DECT Network using the migration wizard.
4
Under Settings, choose the Location from the drop-down menu.
5
Enter a DECT Network name that can contain up to 20 alphanumeric characters.
6
Enter default Handset idle screen name.
7
Choose your Device Type from the drop-down menu. This will define the type of base you’ll use for this DECT Network. You can’t mix and match 110 and 210 base stations,
8
Select your PIN configuration:
Use default access code — Choose this option if you want a standardized pairing process in which every registered handset has the same pairing PIN. This option is ideal when handsets share similar line information. If chosen, enter your default access code in the corresponding box.
Use auto-generated access code — Choose this option if you want a uniquely auto-generated PIN for each registered handset. This option is ideal when unique line information is used for handsets. This ensures that handset A goes to User A and so forth.

  Access codes are used to join handsets to the DECT Network for the first time or if a handset becomes disconnected and needs to be rejoined.
9
Click Next to move to the base stations tab.

  Note: If you click the X at the top of the box to close, the DECT network will not be created and the settings will not be retained. Click Next to create the DECT Network and preserve your settings. The remaining steps are optional at this point and can be completed at a later time via the manage DECT Network processes..
10
Enter the MAC addresses up to 5 at a time, of the base stations you want to register. Enter a comma to separate each MAC address.

  Note: If you click the X at the top of the box from the settings screen, the DECT network will not be created and the settings will not be retained. By clicking Next, will create the DECT Network and preserve your settings. The remaining add base station and add user steps are optional at this point and can be completed at a later time via the manage DECT Network processes.
11
Click Next to move to the Users tab. Here you define which users need to be assigned to handsets and how many.

  Additional lines can be assigned to these handsets via the Managed Handset process. The remaining add user step is optional at this point and can be completed at a later time via the manage DECT Network process.
12
Select Assign Users, then search for users in the corresponding search box and select the user to assign.
13
From the Number of Hansets drop-down menu, select the number of times this user ID can be tied to handsets.

  Note: The number of available lines for each user is based on their available shared lines limit, up to the maximum 30 shared line appearances. For workspaces, only one line is available.

  When assigning a shared line, you can assign numbers from different Webex Calling locations to devices in a different location. For example, a number (user, workspace, virtual line) from the UK location can be assigned to a device that is assigned to a user in the US location.
For more information on shared line across locations, see Configuration of shared lines and virtual lines across locations.
