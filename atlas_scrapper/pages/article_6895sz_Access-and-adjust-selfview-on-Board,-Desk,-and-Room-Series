Access and adjust selfview on Board, Desk, and Room Series
Learn how to adjust your selfview on a Cisco device.
Your selfview shows what others see from your Board, Desk, or Room Series device in a call. You can use it to confirm that they see what you want them to see.
You may want to have your selfview activated during the meeting to ensure that you remain seen on the screen.
If you find the current position of the selfview blocks important parts of the image on your screen, you can move it around.
Board, Desk Series
Room Series
DX70, DX80
MX, SX
To check your selfview at any time, swipe from the right side of your device's home screen, or tap the button. As long as your camera is open/on, you'll see your selfview in the control panel.
Tap Fullscreen if you want to see your selfview in full. To exit fullscreen, open the control panel and tap Fullscreen again.
Tap Selfview in the control panel to set the selfview visibility to Hide, Show in call, or Always show.
To close the control panel, tap anywhere else on the screen.

If you have your selfview in fullscreen mode in a call, you can see the other participants on the top of the screen.
To open and change the location of your selfview on the screen during a call:
If it's not already visible, tap the screen to open the selfview up on top of the call.
Tap the button on the selfview's right corner to change the visibility to Hide, Show in call, or Always show. Even when you select to hide it in call, your selfview will still appear to you in the control panel.
Press the selfview and drag and drop it to change the location. It will snap to pre-defined locations as you drag.
