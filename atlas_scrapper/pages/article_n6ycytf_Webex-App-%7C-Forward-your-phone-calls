Webex App | Forward your phone calls
If you're going to be away from your desk but don't want to miss an important phone call, you can forward your calls to another phone number. Or, if you don't want to be interrupted, you can send all your calls to voicemail instead. If you forward your calls to another number, you won't get called in Webex App anymore. So, be sure to turn call forwarding off when you're ready to take calls in the app again.

How you set up your call forwarding, depends on the phone service you have. If you're not sure, there's an easy way to tell.
