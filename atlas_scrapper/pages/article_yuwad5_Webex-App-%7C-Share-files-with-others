Add information and personality to your spaces by sharing files, attachments, photos, and videos.
You can share most types of files except for .tif files, and the largest file size that you can upload to a space is 2 GB. You can also preview documents without downloading them first if they're no more than 50 pages and less than 100 MB in size, and one of these file types: .doc, .docx, .gif, .jpeg, .pdf, .png, .ppt, .pptx, .xls, and .xlsx
When you add animated GIFs, they'll play automatically in the app if you keep their file size to under 2 MB.
