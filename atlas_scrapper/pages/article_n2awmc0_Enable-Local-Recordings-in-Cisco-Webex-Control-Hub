Enable Local Recordings in Cisco Webex Control Hub
You can allow participants to save recordings for meetings, events, and sessions locally to their Windows desktop devices so they can have immediate access to recordings. Your meetings and events are recorded in MP4 format, while training recordings are saved in WRF format.

Hosts must join with VoIP for the audio to be recorded. Local MP4 recordings don't capture transcriptions, chat records, participant lists, or files shared during the meeting.
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Services, and under Meeting, select Sites.

Select the Webex site you want to enable local recordings for, and click Configure Site.
3
Under Common Settings, select Site Options.
4
In the Site Options section, check Enable local recording for Webex meetings, events, training sessions, and Webex Teams meetings to allow users to save recordings directly to their computers.

  You can have a disclaimer appear before locally recording an MP4 meeting by checking the Show disclaimer for local recording (MP4 only) check box and then entering a URL link to your organization's privacy guidelines in the text field.
