Configure virtual cameras for calls and meetings in Control Hub
You can use Control Hub to enable or disable virtual camera usage for your users' calls and meetings in the Webex app.
Virtual cameras allow users to choose a visual display such as a video feed, static images, a computer desktop share, and so on. Virtual cameras are not hardware cameras, but when enabled, users can select one for their video feed in calls and meetings.

  This setting only lets you enable or disable virtual cameras on macOS. Windows users can always access virtual cameras whether this setting is enabled or disabled.
To enable or disable virtual cameras on Webex sites, use the procedure in Enable or Disable Virtual Cameras in Cisco Webex Meetings.

Off—Disables third-party virtual camera selection for macOS users in your organization, which makes meetings more secure.
