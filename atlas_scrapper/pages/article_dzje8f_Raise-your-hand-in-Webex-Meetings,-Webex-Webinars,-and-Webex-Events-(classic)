Raise your hand in Webex Meetings, Webex Webinars, and Webex Events (classic)
If you have a question or comment during a meeting, breakout session, event, or webinar, and donâ€™t want to interrupt, raise your hand. Raising your hand alerts the host and a raised hand icon appears in your video. A raised hand icon also appears in the Participants panel.
If you don't see the option to raise your hand, the host or cohost may not allow participants to raise their hands.
