From the June 2023 release onward, devices can't access internal IP address ranges outside the ones that we have documented.

Changes to Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC)
Software version: RoomOS 11.5.1.5 c85aed30d22

Software version: RoomOS 11.4.1.8 c2c0e269f17

We have removed upwards domain search and now the devices attempt to download from a single location: http://wpad/wpad.dat. This behavior matches the way how WPAD support in web browsers, such as Netscape and Firefox, works.

Join Webex Webinars as an attendee
Software version: RoomOS 11.4.1.8 c2c0e269f17

Tap the Webex button on the home screen and enter the meeting ID and password.

Increased bandwidth for select Board, Desk, and Room Series devices
Software version: RoomOS 11.2.1.5 dd101dc1279
Select devices can now use more bandwidth which results in improved video quality in a wide range of use cases.

Increased bandwidth noticeably improves the experience when people focus is used. Devices with increased bandwidth threshold will see less impact from issues that are related to network connectivity.

Conference MaxReceiveCallRate
Conference MaxTransmitCallRate
Conference DefaultCall Webex Rate (Applies only to Webex based calls and meetings)
