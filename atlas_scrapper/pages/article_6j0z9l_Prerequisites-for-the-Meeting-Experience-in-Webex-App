Prerequisites for the Meeting Experience in Webex App
As a Webex Meetings site administrator, you can make sure that you meet the prerequisites for the meetings experience in Webex App so that your Meetings users can collaborate better as a team before, during, and after meetings.
The meetings experience in Webex App helps you and your users to meet where you work:
Create spaces in Webex App to work with team members before, during, or after the meeting. Persistent workspaces allow you to track meeting agendas, meeting notes, action items, files, and recordings in one place, making it easier for teams to be more productive beyond meetings.
Join Webex meetings from Webex App, so you can meet where you do your work. Joining Webex meetings from Webex App also allows you to transition easily from team discussions to meetings and back, keeping relevant project information at your fingertips.
Join another user’s Webex Personal Room meeting directly from Webex App, thanks to several shortcuts and the meetings list.
Schedule and start Webex meetings directly from spaces, and manage meetings without requiring a single host.
If you’re a Meetings administrator, check the requirements in the following sections so that you can enable the Webex App meetings experience for your users.
