End of Support for Mac Productivity Tools
The final release for Productivity Tools for Mac will be 41.5 as Microsoft plans to block injection-based plugins on Mac Outlook beginning in mid-May. Mac based Outlook customers who wish to use Webex should move to the Cisco Webex Scheduler.
Webex Productivity Tools is a separate package from the Webex Meetings desktop app. Productivity Tools no longer supports integrations with IBM Lotus Notes, IBM Sametime, Microsoft Lync, Internet Explorer, and Skype for Business from 41.2.
