Configure 802.1x Authentication on the Webex Room Navigator
You can set up 802.1x authentication directly from the Webex Room Navigator settings menu.
You can choose to use a user name and password to authenticate to the network or you can choose to use client certificates. It is also possible to use both at the same time. The client certificates have to be uploaded through the API and need to be activated in order to use the 802.1x service. Setting up and updating the certificates for 802.1x must be done before pairing the Room Navigator to a system or after factory resetting the Room Navigator. The credentials are admin and blank password. For more information on how to add certificates by accessing the API, see the latest version of the API guide .
