Webex App | Permissions Required for Your Mobile Devices
After you download and install Webex App, you can enjoy the app's full functionality by granting it permission to access some suggested features on your device.
iPhone and iPad
Android
Go to Settings > Webex to check the iOS permissions you've granted the app.
Here is a partial list of the permissions Webex App uses:
Calendars: Allows the app to read, add, or remove calendar events stored on your device.
Photos: Requests permission only when you try to share photos in a space.
Microphone: Allows you to make calls and connect with Webex App room devices. The app only records sounds to transmit them but doesn't store them.
Camera: Lets you make video calls, take photos, and share them in spaces.
Notifications: Sends messages and calls from Webex App even when the app is closed and your screen is locked.
Background App Refresh: Updates data while the app is running in the background.
