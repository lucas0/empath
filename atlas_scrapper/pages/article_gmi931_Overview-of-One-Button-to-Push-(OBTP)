Overview of One Button to Push (OBTP)
In this article
Set up One Button to Push (OBTP) so that when a scheduled meeting includes video devices, a green Join button appears on the devices right before the meeting begins, just as it does in the Cisco Webex Teams app.
Join button on video devices and Webex boards
Users can schedule meetings and include video devices and Webex Boards that display the Join button by using any of these methods:
Webex App meetings
From a space.
From the calendar, by entering a scheduling keyword in the meeting location field.
Webex meetings
From the calendar, using Webex Productivity Tools..
From the calendar, by entering a scheduling keyword in the meeting location field.
From the calendar, by entering a URL in the meeting location or body.
Using the Webex Meetings Scheduler for Google Chrome.
Other types of meetings
From the calendar, by entering a supported video address format in the meeting location or body.
To provide One Button to Push on video devices, you deploy the Hybrid Calendar. The details of the deployment depend on the type of calendar environment that you have, and on the type of device.
