Configure push-to-talk for Webex Calling users
Let specific users treat their desk phones as a one-way or two-way intercom
Push-to-talk connects users in different parts of your organization. For example, you can create a list of customer service representatives who can chat with Jim in the warehouse using push-to-talk on their phones. This way, the reps can quickly chat with Jim about things like inventory and delivery schedules.
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Users and then select the user you want to modify.
2
Select Calling, go to Between-User Permissions, and then turn on Push to Talk.
3
Choose the connection type:
One-way—the users you add to the Allowed users list can chat with this person but only in one direction. The person you enable push-to-talk for can’t respond to the people in the Allowed users list.
Two-way—the users you add to the Allowed users list can have a two-way conversation. The person you enable push-to-talk for can respond to the people in the Allowed users list.
4
Create your Allowed or Blocked Users list and then click Save.
Let people in the Allowed Users list know that they can use their desk phone to communicate with users that have push-to-talk enabled. They can press *50 and then enter the extension of the person they want to use push-to-talk with.
