Configure a Default Voicemail Passcode for All New Users
As an administrator, you can assign default passcode to new users.
If you choose to set default passcode for the new users added to your organization, communicate to your users what that passcode is, and that it must be reset using their device or the app before they can access their voicemail. If this feature is not turned on, each new user must initially set their own passcode on Webex Settings .

From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Services > Calling > Service Settings.

Under the Voicemail section, select the Voicemail Passcode toggle to enable default passcodes for your organization.

Must contain a minimum of 6 digits and a maximum of 30.
