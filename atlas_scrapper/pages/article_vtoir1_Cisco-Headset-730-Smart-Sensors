Cisco Headset 730 Smart Sensors
Your Cisco Headset 730 can detect when your headset is on or off your head.
The Cisco Headset 730 smart sensors detect when you put on or take off your headset. When your smart sensors are enabled, you can pause your music playback or mute a call when you take off your headset. You can also answer an incoming call when you pick up your headset. You can toggle some or all of these settings in the following places:
The Cisco Headsets mobile app
Webex App (version 42.9 or later)
A compatible Cisco IP Phone (phone firmware 12.8(1) or later)
On Cisco Jabber for Windows or Mac (version 12.9 or later)

  Smart sensors are On by default on Cisco IP Phones and in Cisco Jabber. In the Cisco Headsets app, smart sensors are Off by default.
