Directory sync from Workspaces in Control Hub
Automatically import rooms from your Directory and create all your workspaces at scale inside Control Hub. This is to assist you when you’re moving your on-premises deployment to Control Hub.
Directory sync creates workspaces from the rooms that you have set up in your Active Directory. It’s a one-way synchronization from your Directory to Control Hub.
The directory sync creates workspaces based on email address, name, or SIP address. If there are workspaces already in Control Hub with the same email address or name as in your Active Directory, no new workspace gets created.
To create workspaces with a SIP address, you need to set up Directory Connector to synchronize room information to the cloud.

Workspaces without any devices are deleted from Control Hub if the Directory room is deleted. You can choose to deselect this option during the setup.
Prerequisites:
Currently, only on-premise Active Directory sync with Directory Connector is supported
The Directory Synchronization must be enabled with the Directory Connector’s Room import turned on
Limitations
On devices running CE9 software, you can't call from the directory to Workspaces with a SIP address imported from Active Directory.
