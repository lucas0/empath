Configure settings templates
Administrators can use settings templates to apply collections of settings to groups of users, including all users in a particular location. A settings template is a collection of custom settings for a service (meeting, messaging, calling, or vidcast) or a location. Settings templates help to simplify the onboarding and management of users in your organization.
