Call someone using the dial pad
Call someone in your organization

Click Call to make the call and step away from your meeting.
Your audio and video in the meeting pause.

When you're finished with your call, click Resume to go back to the meeting.
Rejoin the meeting with the same audio and video settings you had before you made the call.
