Integrate teams in Webex with groups in Microsoft 365
When a user creates a team in Webex App they can automatically create and connect the team to a Microsoft 365 group. They can then manage people in the team from Microsoft 365 and use Microsoft Sharepoint folders to save their files.
Overview
Prerequisites
Enable Groups integration
This integration enables your Webex users to create groups in Microsoft 365 when they create teams in Webex. When you've done the integration, this is how it works for your users.
You'll need admin access to your Microsoft tenant, the MS365 groups feature, and your users in Azure AD. Optionally you can sync users to Webex from your on-premises Active Directory, but first you must sync them to AD from Azure AD.
You'll also need admin access to your Webex organization, to check that users are synced, and to enable content management.
