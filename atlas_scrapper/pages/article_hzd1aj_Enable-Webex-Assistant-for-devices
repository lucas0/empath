Before you begin
If you want Webex Assistant for devices to import your organizationâ€™s Common Identity data, enable directory synchronization in Control Hub. For more information about directory synchronization, see the Deployment guide for Hybrid Directory.
1
Sign in to Control Hub at https://admin.webex.com, and go to Devices then click Settings.
2
Scroll to Cisco Webex Assistant For Devices, and then check Enable Cisco Webex Assistant For Devices.
This check box appears even if you don't have the supported devices available.
Webex Assistant is now enabled on all supported devices across your organization. To enable or disable Webex Assistant on a specific device, see Toggle Webex Assistant for Devices Off and On from the Touch 10 Controller.

  Joining meetings with Webex Assistant using One Button to Push (OBTP) is only available if users book meetings using Cisco Webex Meetings or add @webex in the location field of the meeting invitation. For information about how to enable OBTP for devices, see Make it Easier for Video Devices to Join Meetings with OBTP.

You're now ready to start using Webex Assistant. Just say "OK Webex", followed by something like "Call Alison Cassidy", "Join my Personal Room", or "Record the meeting". Webex Assistant will take care of the rest!
If you want to see what kind of options you have with Webex Assistant, just say "OK Webex. What you can do?".
