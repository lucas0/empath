Microsoft Teams Support
The Cisco Headset USB HD Adapter supports call controls on the most recent version of Microsoft Teams.
You can:
Answer and end calls
Hold and resume calls
Mute and unmute your headset
Adjust your headset volume
Multi-app Control
This firmware version offers users an improved call control experience when you use multiple Cisco desktop calling applications at the same time. For example, you can mute an active call in the Webex app and then answer an incoming Cisco Jabber call through the Jabber UI. While you are on the Jabber call, call controls through the headset only impact Jabber. When the Jabber call is complete, you can resume your Webex call and maintain call control through your headset.

  Active calls don't automatically hold when you answer an incoming call on a different application. Be sure to hold or mute a call on one application before you answer an incoming call on a different calling app.
This release only enables multi-app control between Webex (version 41.7 or later) and Cisco Jabber (version 12.9 or later). Partial multi-app functionality is available with Microsoft Teams.
Minor Bug Fixes
This release fixes issues with ringback on Cisco Jabber, interoperability on Microsoft Teams, and music playback on macOS devices.

For more information, see Pair the USB Adapter to Your Headset.

Version 1-0-48
Cisco Headset USB HD Adapter
Your Cisco Headset 730 comes with a USB HD Adapter for use with call devices that don't have a Bluetooth option. The USB HD Adapter comes out of the box paired to your headset. The adapter automatically connects to your headset when it plugs into a powered USB port.
When you connect the USB Adapter, the LED blinks and then turns solid when it connects to your headset. If your headset is unavailable to connect, the LED shuts off.
When you want to disconnect your headset, simply unplug the adapter from the call device. It takes about 10 minutes for your headset to accept another active Bluetooth connection after you disconnect the USB HD Adapter. You can also turn off your headset then on again to pair a new device quickly.
