Change the interpretation direction in Webex meetings and webinars
If you're interpreting from a source language to a target language and back to the source language (bi-directional interpretation), only the attendees in your current language channel can hear you. Switch the direction of your language channel so that attendees in the audio channel of the language you're interpreting to can hear you.
When you join a meeting or webinar as an interpreter, you automatically join the audio channel for the language that the host assigned to you. So, if you were assigned to interpret from English to Dutch, you join the Dutch language channel. The source and target language appear on your screen and you can switch between them whenever you change the language to which you're interpreting.
