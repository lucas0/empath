Webex App | Block calls
Stay focused on whatâ€™s important, stop unwanted calls directly in the app. Block callers from your recents list or add the number to your block list.
You can block up to 200 numbers, but they must be external numbers.
When you enter a number in the block list, use the full country code and area code format.
If your administrator has set up your profile with multiple lines, you can't block calls when they come in on a line you share with other colleagues.
