Switch your view in Webex Meetings, Webex Webinars, and Webex Events (classic)
In this article
When you're in a meeting, webinar, or event, you can use the different views in the video layout options to stay engaged with fellow participants. For example, you can focus just on the active speaker or shared content.
Video layout views
There are four views that you can select from. There are advantages to using each of these views and you can change views at any time.
Grid view—Useful when you want to divide your attention across a lot of speakers in a large meeting.
Stack view—Useful when you want to see other participants appear above the active speaker or shared content.
Side by side view—Useful when you want to see participants appear next to the active speaker or shared content.
Full-screen view—Useful when you want to float panels and scale them freely, or drag them to another monitor.
For information about the maximum capacity for meetings, webinars, and events, see What is the maximum number of participants in a Webex session or call?
