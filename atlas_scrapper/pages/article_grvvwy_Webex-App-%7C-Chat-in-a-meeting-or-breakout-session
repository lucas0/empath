Webex App | Chat in a meeting or breakout session
Get more from your meeting with in-meeting chat. Chat to everyone in the meeting, or directly with a meeting participant. Post messages when you have something to say but don't want to interrupt whoever's speaking. Revisit and share the chat after the meeting ends. If the conversation is focused on the speaker, for example, hosts and cohosts can turn off chat in the meeting.
This feature is available on our Video Mesh-ready meeting platform. Find out if your meetings use the Video Mesh-ready meeting platform.

  People who are invited to a meeting associated with a space can send messages to meeting participants, even if they haven't joined the meeting. For example, if you're running late to a meeting, use chat to let the participants who already joined know that you'll be there soon.
Chat to everyone in the meeting
When you join a meeting, you can view all the messages that were sent since the meeting started. If you're discussing sensitive content, we recommend that you don't use your Personal Room for meetings. If you don't lock your Personal Room and have back-to-back meetings, anyone who joins can see messages since the Personal Room was open. Chats to everyone are saved in the post-meeting summary.

If your organization saves meeting messages after the meeting ends, you can access the meeting messages and forward them to another person or space in your organization, if you have Messaging enabled.
