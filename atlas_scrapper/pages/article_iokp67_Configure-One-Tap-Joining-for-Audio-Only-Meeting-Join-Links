Configure One-Tap Joining for Audio-Only Meeting Join Links
You can set up Webex meeting invitation emails on Android and iOS devices to include a link to a phone number that participants can tap to call in to a meeting directly. One-tap joining allows people to join the audio conference of a meeting without having to enter their password or use the mobile app.
To include one-tap joining links in email invitations, meetings can't require attendees to sign in. If the meeting requires a password, it needs to be included in the email invitation. You can set these options for anyone who schedules meetings on your site.
