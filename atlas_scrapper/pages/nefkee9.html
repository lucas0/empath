Options on the Entry Form Tab

Plan ahead and select the fields with care.
The fields that are selected or added on the Entry Form tab appear on the forms customers submit when they request assistance. WebACD provides these fields on the Entry Form tab:
First name
Last name
Email address
Phone number
WebACD requires that the customer provides their first name, last name, and email address. Site administrators may already have this information (and other details) about a customer who is stored in a profile. If this information about the customer is supplied in the HTML sent to the server, these fields do not have to be displayed, and the customer will not be required to fill them in. Provide the correct parameters to WebACD.
Site administrators also use these field names later, if rules for routing requests are set up. Set up rules to route requests to specific agents that are based on the information the customer provides on this form. Later, create reports to track problems that customers report and the response by members of your support organization.
Example: Your support group assists customers of Bay City Software. You handle general calls about signing in, problems with accounts, and so on. The group also handles questions about the three services in the enterprise version of the software suite:
Human resources
Finance
Research
Site administrators can add fields to the entry form that help the customer narrow their problem. Select how WebACD displays these choices to customers:
In a text box
As check boxes
As option buttons
In a drop-down list
Options on the Entry Link Tab

Copy and paste this code to the website. This code includes the images that are selected for the buttons. To use buttons with a company’s logo or branding, site administrators can replace references of image files in the HTML code using names of uploaded images.
Add New Fields to the Entry Form
Site administrators can tailor the Entry Form to capture any needed information. Customers can provide details about the problem or issues that are found in a product or service. Message forms can then be routed to the person best equipped to take the call.

Two types of rules can be set up:
