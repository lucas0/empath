  You can add up to 30 people at once by pasting a list of email addresses from your email application. Just copy the recipients list for an email and paste that list in the Add people to this space field.
To invite people to Webex App, type their email address and press Enter. After they join Webex App they'll see your space in the app.

  Once you add someone to a space, they receive a notification that they were added.
If you can't add someone, it could be because the space is moderated. Ask somebody in the Moderators list to add them.
