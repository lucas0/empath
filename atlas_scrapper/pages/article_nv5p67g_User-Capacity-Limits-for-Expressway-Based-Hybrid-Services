User Capacity Limits for Expressway-Based Hybrid Services
Use this article to plan your connector capacity for Webex Hybrid Service deployments and understand the scalability recommendations. For both dedicated and coresident connector deployments, you'll find the maximum supported user numbers for connector clusters, the factors that determine the supported user limits, and how to use Control Hub to evaluate whether you need to add more Expressways.

Hybrid Call Service on the Call Connector architecture has gone End of Life (EOL), so the service is no longer officially supported. Call Connector should not be considered for future Expressway capacity planning for Hybrid Services.

This article does not cover capacity planning for the Hybrid Calendar Service Cisco TMS integration with Office 365 or Cisco TMS integration with Google Calendar. For capacity information, see the Deployment Guide for Cisco Webex Hybrid Calendar Service.
