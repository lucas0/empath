Network Test on Board, Desk, and Room Series Devices
You can run a network test on your device during the initial setup wizard. You can also perform a Webex connectivity test once your device is activated.
When you are registering your device to Webex during the set up wizard, you need to enter your Webex activation code. If you are unable to connect to Webex, the button Cloud Connection Test becomes available. Select it in order to check the connectivity. If the test fails, the network page is available and you can see the network status along with the result of the test.
Follow the next steps to run a Webex connectivity test once your device is activated:
1
Swipe right on the home screen and choose Device Settings.
2
Select Issues and Diagnostics.
3
Tap Webex connectivity test.
The tests are logged in the application log, so you can send them to your administrator or use the send logs functionality.
