Show your video over shared content in Webex Meetings and Webex Webinars
As a presenter, place your camera's video over content that you're sharing to make your presentation more immersive.
If you joined the meeting using the Meetings desktop app, you can share your camera's video over your shared content. Participants who join using the desktop app, mobile app, or video devices can see you in front of the presentation. Participants who join using the web app won't see you over the presentation.

  Your camera's video won't appear over shared content in meeting or webinar recordings.
