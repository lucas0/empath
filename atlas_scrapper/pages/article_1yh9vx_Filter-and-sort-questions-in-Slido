Filter and sort questions in Slido
As a Webex Meetings or Webex Webinars host, filter and sort live questions to make your Q&A sessions more efficient for you to manage.
Slido is available in Webex Meetings. You can use Slido in plans for up to 10,000 users in Webex Webinars on version 41.9 and later sites. Slido polls are available for up to 10,000 attendees, while quizzes are available for up to 5,000 users.
Filtering and changing the sort order affects your view only.
