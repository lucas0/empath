Hide or show your people insights profile in meetings and webinars
If you don't want people to be able to view your profile during Webex Meetings and Webex Webinars, you can hide or turn off your profile. When you hide your profile, it's hidden in all meetings and webinars until you decide to show it again.
People insights profiles are available on the Meetings desktop app, the Webex App, the Meetings app for Android or iOS, and Webex Webinars. Your Webex site and users must be linked to Control Hub or managed in Control Hub, with Directory Synchronization turned on.
People insights profiles in meetings and webinars are available for users joining meetings or webinars on US-based cluster sites, and are only available in English at this time. Users who join from non-US organizations can access the public people insights profiles of anyone who is in a meeting on a site that has people insights profiles turned on. This feature will be rolled out to more devices and platforms in the future.
For in-depth information about people insights profiles, see People Insights Profiles: Creating a Human Collaboration Experience.
If you only want to hide or show certain sections of your profile, such as your photo, a past position, or your social media links, see Create or edit your people insights profile in meetings or webinars.
