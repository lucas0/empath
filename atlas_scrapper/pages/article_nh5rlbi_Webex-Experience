What is Webex Experience?
We measure the progress of your organization's configuration and adoption so we can report back to you on the quality of your Webex experience. We present you with service level data and insights, so you can act quickly to remediate challenges and improve the quality of your users' experience.
The feature provides elaborate insights about your organization configuration, adoption of the services you've purchased, and any performance bottlenecks. It identifies anomalies, or deviations from best practices in these three categories, and suggests reasons and resolutions. Webex experience has a simple score to help you understand the urgency and impact of these insights.
You need to be a full administrator to interact with Webex experience, but you can see the scores if you have read-only permissions.
If you are managing customer organizations, you need to be a sales-full-admin or partner-full-admin to interact with a customer's Webex experience, or a partner-read-only admin to see a customer's Webex experience page.
Updates to Webex Experience Public Preview
We are excited to announce a series of updates to the public beta of Webex Experience. We renamed Organization Health to Webex Experience to align with its purposeâ€”to help you understand your organization's experience of Webex. We measure your progress against recommended setup, adoption, and performance practices to derive your overall Webex Experience score.
We've also listened to your feedback over several months of public beta, and have used your suggestions to improve Webex Experience as follows:
New insights
Enabling people insights for your users contributes to your Webex experience.
Assigning different administrator roles contributes to your Webex experience.
Adding phone numbers contributes to your Webex experience score.
We track the average meeting join time and show the trend over time. This insight is not scored.
Configuring your dial plan, default phone settings, and location specific routing all contribute to your score.
Scoring changes
We are trying to focus attention on the value of the insights, rather than a complex scoring system, so we changed to a qualitative scoring system. This shows how you are doing against your goals and the recommended practices.
We expect the new scoring and goal-setting framework to give you a better understanding of the insights and more control over how they are derived.
Setup actions are either Complete or Incomplete, while adoption metrics can be Excellent, Fair, or Needs Improvement.
To keep it simple, each insight contributes equally to the score. Your score jumps for every action you take.
Your overall progress is either:
Superb (you completed all actions and achieved all goals),
Excellent (you completed 70%),
Fair (50-70%), or
Needs Improvement (less than 50% actions taken or goals met).
Video and VoIP adoption goals
We made the video and VoIP adoption metrics goal-oriented, so they are more relevant to your own targets rather than our recommendation. You set your own video and VoIP goals, so you can measure your adoption towards those:

Other updates
You can remove an insight if it's not relevant for your organization. When you remove an insight it does not count towards your score. You can put it back in later if you want.
If you have multiple meetings sites, you can select some or all of your sites to contribute towards your meetings insights.
Call to action
Webex Experience is still in beta, and we are still collecting feedback. During the public preview phase, you'll see a (Beta) Webex Experience card on the Overview page.
We encourage you to take advantage of Webex Experience, and leave feedback using the controls in the interface (below). Another option is to work with your account teams to provide detailed feedback to the product development team.
