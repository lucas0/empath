Make someone a presenter
Hosts and cohosts can control who shares during a meeting and designate a participant as a Presenter directly from their thumbnail video.
After hosts or cohosts turn off sharing, the host or cohost can pass a Presenter role to a particular participant in the meeting to share. If the Presenter role passes to a participant who's paired to a device, the device also inherits the Presenter role. If there are other participants paired to that same device, they can't share from their computer with Webex App. However, if the Presenter role is passed to a device, each participant paired to that device can share from Webex App.
1

Hover over the desired participant's thumbnail video, click More actions and then select Make presenter.
