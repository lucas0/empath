UC Manager Profiles in Cisco Webex Control Hub
You can add and manage UC Manager Profiles in Control Hub if your organization uses Calling in Webex App (Unified CM).
Create a UC manager profile
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Management > Organization Settings, and under UC Manager Profiles select Add Profile.
2
Add a Profile Name, choose the necessary settings, and then select Save.
Enter a Voice Services Domain if you have SRV records but the login email domain is not used for service discovery. It's required for Mobile Remote Access (MRA), as well. You can also enter a UDS server if the Webex App account user ID does not match the Unified CM user ID or ILS is not enabled in a multiple Unified CM cluster deployment. With both values entered, Webex App uses UDS first for the premises and Voice Services for MRA.
