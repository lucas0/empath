Optimize your Webex Webinars and Webex Meetings for all voices
To create a better and more engaging experience, you can filter out background voices and noises that would normally be picked up by a mic from your voice. Optimizing for all voices enhances the background voices to bring them to forward.
This feature is only available when you select Use computer audio only.
Our advanced deep learning, speech science, and audio processing technology enhances your voice by separating them from the background and then suppressing background voices. Your colleagues won't hear the other voices or background noises in your workspace––just you.
You can optimize your audio to prioritize your voice before or during a meeting or webinar by doing the following:
Click Audio options , click the drop-down arrow under Webex smart audio, and select Optimize for my voice or Optimize for all voices.

  Once you've selected a Webex smart audio option, that is set as the default for your future meetings and webinars on your site.
Click Audio options , click Audio settings, and select Optimize for my voice or Optimize for all voices.
