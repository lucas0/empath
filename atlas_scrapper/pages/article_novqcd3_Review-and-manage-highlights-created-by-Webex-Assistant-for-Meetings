Review and manage highlights created by Webex Assistant for Meetings
If you used Webex Assistant to capture highlights during your Webex meeting or webinar, the highlights are available after the meeting or webinar ends. The host can share the highlights with others and give them either view-only or edit privileges.
Webex Assistant is available in Meetings and Webex Webinars (not available for webinars in webcast view).
Beginning with the 41.5 update, Webex Webinars supports Webex Assistant.
In addition to Meetings and Webinars, with the 41.7 update, Webex Assistant is also available for the Webex App. Meetings started or joined from a space don't support Webex Assistant.
Webex for Government doesn't support Webex Assistant.
This feature requires Cisco Webex video platform version 2.0 with joining meetings from video systems enabled. To find out which version youâ€™re using, see Find your Webex Meetings version number.
Hosts can turn on or turn off the Webex Assistant during the meeting or webinar. To automatically turn on the Webex Assistant whenever you start a meeting or webinar, see Set your Webex Meetings scheduling preferences.
