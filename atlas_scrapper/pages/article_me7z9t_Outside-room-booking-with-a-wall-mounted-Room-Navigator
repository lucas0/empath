Outside room booking with a wall mounted Room Navigator
With room booking, you can see the availability status for the room and book the room for a spontaneous meeting.
The Cisco Room Navigator for wall mounting can be configured as a room booking device. It displays the room availability status and users can book impromptu meetings or see the room calendar.


The room booking device has a colored light strip to provide an indication of the room status from a distance.
Green - available
Red - in use or occupied
Yellow - meeting starting soon (10 minutes before the start of a new meeting) or the room is booked but not occupied
You can also see the temperature and people count of the room.
Tap the Room Calendar button to see the upcoming meetings.


If the room is available, you book the room by tapping the Book now button.


The room can be booked from the present time up until midnight of the same day, as long as the room is available. The minimum meeting time is 10 minutes.
Tap the time slot to book the room for 15 minutes or more. Then, tap Book.
The room scheduler displays the details for the meeting and the color of the LED changes to red.


When you make a booking, the new meeting becomes visible in the meeting room’s calendar, but it doesn’t show up in your personal calendar.
