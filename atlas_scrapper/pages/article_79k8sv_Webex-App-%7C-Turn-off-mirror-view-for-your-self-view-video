Webex App | Turn off mirror view for your self-view video
By default, when you look at your self-view video during a call or meeting, your video appears reversed, as if you're looking at your reflection in a mirror. Mirror view applies to your self-view video only; it isn't broadcast to other people. If you want to see yourself as other participants see you during a call or meeting, turn off mirror view.
