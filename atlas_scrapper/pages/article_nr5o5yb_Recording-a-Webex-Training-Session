Recording a Webex Training Session

Only the host or an alternate host can record a Training session. You cannot record if the recording option is not available. If an alternate host records the session, the host still receives and owns the recording after the Training ends.
Recordings in the cloud are saved in Advanced Recording Format (ARF). Recordings on your computer are saved in Webex Recording Format (WRF).
1
Desktop users: If you want to record on your computer instead of in the cloud, go to Webex Training: Session > Recorder Settings > Record on This Computer.
2
Select to record right away. You and your participants see a red icon at the bottom of your window when the recording is in process.
3
Do one of the following:
Select Pause recording to pause and resume the recording, maintaining a single recording.
Select to end your current recording.
When the session ends, you receive an email with the recording link. Depending on file size and bandwidth, it can take up to 24 hours to receive your recording. To access your recordings on your Webex site, go to Webex > Recordings to see your recorded meetings, events, and training sessions.
