Webex Meetings shared components from the latest updates
With each monthly update, new features are delivered to your slow channel Webex site. See which new shared component features are part of the slow channel update each month.
What are shared components?
Shared components are common features that are delivered to both slow channel and latest channel sites each month. All sites automatically receive updates to the Webex components delivered by the cloud, such as Webex site pages, meeting integrations, APIs, the mobile app, the web app, and site administration.
As a slow channel customer, you’ve chosen to keep the desktop meeting application on a specific supported slow channel version. You will not see changes to your in-meeting experience, like those added to latest channel sites, unless your site upgrades to a newer desktop app version.
The following are the new shared component updates delivered to slow channel sites:

Changes in retention storage policy for Webex Meetings
Webex is removing the option to retain post-meeting data (recording and transcripts) for an indefinite period.
If the retention policy has been set to indefinite today, then the default retention period changes to 3 years, with the option to change it from 7 days to a maximum of 10 years. You also have the option to purge user deleted recordings within 30 days or make them follow the retention policy.
If you have the pro-pack offer, these changes come into effect from March 2023 and are completed in July 2023.
To avoid any interruptions, change the retention policy from indefinite in Control Hub to a value between 7 days to 10 years. For more information, see Data retention changes coming in 2023.

Webex Meetings sites to get user profile data from Webex Identity
When a Control Hub managed site is updated with this feature, user profile data for that meeting site is acquired from the Webex Identity in Control Hub rather than it being specific to each meeting site. Each site does a one-time sync as part of this switching to Webex Identity as the source for user profile data.

Flow updated for a user joining a meeting and signing in or signing up for a Webex account using Google credentials
Due to a change mandated by Google, starting with the January 43.1 update, the flow for users when joining a Webex meeting and trying to sign up or sign into their Webex account using Google credentials has changed.
