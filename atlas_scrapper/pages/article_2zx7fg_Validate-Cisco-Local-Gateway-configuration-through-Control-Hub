Validate Cisco Local Gateway configuration through Control Hub
In this article
Overview
As a Webex Calling administrator, one of your key requirements is to configure your local gateways. The Config Validation option available in Control Hub lets you validate your configuration. It identifies any misconfigurations and provides guidance on corrections, before they cause issues for your users. Using Config Validation, you can re-validate your configuration until it is error free.

To perform Config Validation, it is mandatory that you enroll your managed gateway with Control Hub and assign Local Gateway as a service.
Config Validation is supported only for Registration-Based local gateways.
