Set up security for Webex Contact Center
In this article
This article helps you to configure or manage privacy shield and content security policy. Privacy shield enables you to control the handling of sensitive information during a call. Content security policy is important to ensure that the desktop responds as expected on your network. You can also add the required domain to the allowed list through security settings.
Enable or disable privacy shield for call
The Privacy Shield feature enables agents to pause the recording of sensitive information during a call. This feature protects customer information such as credit card and social security numbers. Although the call recording is paused, the metadata of the call such as duration, dial number, routing path, and other related information are still recorded in the contact center database.
To enable or disable Privacy Shield:
1
Sign in to Control Hub.
2
Navigate to Services > Contact Center.
3
From the Contact Center navigation page, select Tenant settings > Security.
4
In the Privacy Shield section, use the toggle button to enable or disable the Privacy Shield feature. By default, the Privacy Shield feature is enabled. When you disable this feature, an agent cannot pause the recording of sensitive information during a call. Consider this setting only if the Pause/Resume Enabled for queues is not enabled in the Management Portal (Provisioning > Entry Points/Queues > Queue/Outdial Queue > Advanced Settings).
Enable or disable attachments for chat and email
Webex Contact Center supports attachments with the following file extensions:
.html .mhtml .mht .odt .pdf .pdfxml .rtf .shtml .xps .xml .xhtml .txt .eml .msg .ods .dot .dothtml .dotx .dotm .pot .pothtml .ppthtml .pptmhtml .pptxml .potm .potx .pps .ppam .ppsm .ppsx .pptx .pptm .ppt .pub .pubhtml .pubmhtml .xls .xlshtml .xlthtml .xlt .xlsm .xltx .xltm .xlam .xlsb .xlsx

Embedded images are not supported in attachments.
You can send and receive a maximum of 10 files. The total file size must be less than 25 MB. When the email attachments exceed 25 MB, a few attachments are dropped to stay within the file size limit and then assigned to an agent.
To enable or disable attachments for chat and email:

Sign in to Control Hub.
2
Navigate to Services > Contact Center.
3
From the Contact Center navigation page, select Tenant settings > Security.

Set up content security policy
Content security policy enables you to define an allowed list of trusted domains that you can access from Webex Contact Center applications. This helps to ensure compliance with the content security policy framework that browsers enforce. To know more about the content security policy, see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP.
To add a trusted domain to the allowed list:
1
Sign in to Control Hub.
2
Navigate to Services > Contact Center.
3
From the Contact Center navigation page, select Tenant settings > Security.
4
In the Content Security Policy Allowed List section, enter the domain of the web resource that you need to access.
5
Click Add.
The domain appears in the Registered Domains list.

  To remove a domain, click the x mark on the domain name. Domains that are tagged in grey are mandatory and cannot be removed.
If the Agent Desktop is embedded within an iFrame of another domain of an organization, add the domain to the allowed list of the Content Security Policy. After you add the domain to the allowed list, it takes 10 minutes for the Agent Desktop to load within an iFrame. You can either reload or sign in again to the Agent Desktop to view the changes.
Source IP Addresses for Webex Contact Center
This article lists the source IP addresses that you must allowlist on the firewall. With this configuration, Webex Contact Center can make network calls to the external services hosted on your premises, through your firewalls. This setting applies to various use cases such as Flow Designer HTTP nodes or external webhooks.
These IP addresses are for customers that must allowlist Webex Contact Center as the source. This setting applies to all network calls originating from data centers and go out over the internet through the Network Address Translation (NAT) gateways. We don't provide IP addresses of Webex Contact Center as the destination address because inbound requests to data centers go through load balancers and IP addresses are dynamic.
The following IP addresses are defined for each data center. Depending on your country of operation, source IP addresses vary. For more information on the supported data centers, see the Data Locality in Webex Contact Center article.

This article is only about source IP addresses for Webex Contact Center. For information on the domains required for the Agent Desktop, see the Domain Access Required for Desktop section in Cisco Webex Contact Center Setup and Administration Guide.
