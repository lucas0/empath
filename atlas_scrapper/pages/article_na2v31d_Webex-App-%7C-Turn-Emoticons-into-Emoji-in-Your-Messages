Webex App | Turn Emoticons into Emoji in Your Messages
Webex App will automatically change emoticon text into an equivalent emoji, on your Windows or Mac. Now you can easily add some fun to your message content, and also save time by reducing the number of mouse clicks to get to the emoji menu.
Before you begin
If you have problems displaying emojis on Windows, upgrade Windows 10 to the latest release to ensure you have Segoe UI Emoji font 1.12 or a later version.
When you're composing a message, type an emoticon leaving a space after the text, and Webex App will automatically change it to an emoji. By the way, you can still add emojis to your messages or use emoji shortcodes like you always have.

  If you paste an emoticon into a message, it will not change to an emoji, emoticons are only translated when they are typed into the message area.
Take a look at some of the more common emoticons, and their equivalent Windows and Mac emoji characters. There are many more - just include emoticons in your messages and see them change to emoji.
