My Bluetooth Device Can't Find the Headset
Your Cisco Headset 730 should appear in your device Bluetooth list as Cisco HS 730 followed by the last three digits of your headset serial number.
Try these steps if your headset doesn't connect with your Bluetooth device:
On your call device:
Turn Bluetooth off, then on again.
Delete your headset from the list of Bluetooth devices and pair the headset again.
Reboot your headset.
Make sure that your headset is within 3 feet (1 meter) of your intended device.
Clear all paired devices from the headset and pair the headset again.
See Delete Paired Devices.
