This section describes the proxy support feature for Hybrid Data Security. It is intended to supplement the Deployment Guide for Cisco Webex Hybrid Data Security, available at https://www.cisco.com/go/hybrid-data-security. In a new deployment, you configure the proxy setup on each node after uploading and mounting the HDS configuration ISO on the node, and before registering the node with the Cisco Webex cloud.
