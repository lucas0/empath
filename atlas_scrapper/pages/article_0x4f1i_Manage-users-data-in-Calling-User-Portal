Manage users data in Calling User Portal
Administrators can access and manage features for users in the Calling User Portal. This is helpful when users are out of the office unexpectedly, when troubleshooting user features, and when needing to set up settings for an executive.
You can manage some of the user features only in Calling User Portal. You can access Calling User Portal through Control Hub.
Before you begin
You must have full administrator privilege.

From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Users, and then select the user.
2
Click Calling and scroll down to Calling User Portal.
3
Click Launch, which cross-launches you to the Calling User Portal.
