Jabber | Move Contacts and Common Settings to Webex
If your administrator has set you up for an upgrade from Cisco Jabber to Webex, you can use a built in tool to migrate your contacts and common settings over so you're ready for the move to Webex.
After you start Jabber and sign in, the tool automatically appears momentarily (it can take between 5 minutes–3 hours), but you can run it yourself if you're ready by using these steps. You may need to restart Jabber restart might be necessary. Your data in Jabber is safe and won't be affected by the tool moving the data to Webex.

Make sure you meet the following Webex requirements:
We recommend that you download Webex from https://www.webex.com/downloads.html or from the site your administrator directed you to and then install it on the system that you're already using Jabber on.
Make sure you install the latest release; you may need to sign into Webex before the Jabber data can be moved over.
1
Click Help and then choose Move Data to Webex.
2
Read the welcome screen and then click Next .
3
Check the items you want to move to Webex:
Contacts—Moves most common contact types: directory contacts with existing emails in the cloud, custom contacts and photos, and XMPP federated contacts.
Preferences—Moves calling preferences: video call preferences (on or off), mute notification settings (for chat and calls—mute all if it's set in Jabber, otherwise the default setting in Webex), and audio and video device selection (the currently selected device, if set).
4
Click Move to Webex .
You'll see a status indicator that says your data is being prepared.
The next screen shows that Webex is going to be launched if it's installed. You may need to sign into Webex if it's the first time you're opening it.

  If Webex is not installed, an error message appears. You can contact your administrator or install the latest version of Webex that's referenced in the prerequisites above.
5
On the You're all moved over! screen, click Restart Webex.
Errors may happen if contacts can't be moved over or there's a network issue. The tool in Jabber will show you a report and next steps you can take if any issues occur—any contacts that can't be moved over (for example, contacts that aren't already in the cloud directory service that Webex uses or local contacts in Active Directory that weren't synchronized to the cloud) are exported as a comma-separated value (CSV) file for your reference. You can restart the built in tool at any time if it fails.

  You can only sign into the phone service on one calling app at a time. For example, you can't sign into the phone service on both Jabber and Webex at the same time. If you're using Jabber and sign in to Webex, the phone service in Jabber is disconnected.
