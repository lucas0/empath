Directory Service Integration via Webex Common Identity for Dedicated Instance
In this article
Synchronize users from a Cloud Directory (Microsoft Azure AD) or on-prem directory (MS AD) to Dedicated Instance clusters (CUCM & Unity) via the Webex Common Identity Service using the Control Hub interface.
Overview
Synchronize users from cloud-based directory such as Azure AD to Dedicated Instance applications such as Unified Communications Manager and Cisco Unity Connection with the Cloud Directory Service. During synchronization, the system imports a list of users and associated user data from the Azure Active Directory (or a similar Cloud Directory service) that is synchronized into the Webex Identity Service. You need to select the Unified CM cluster from Control Hub that needs synchronization, select the appropriate Unified CM User ID field mapping, and then select the required synchronization agreement to perform synchronization.
Prerequisites
If you are using Azure Active Directory as your cloud directory, see Set up Azure AD Wizard App in Control Hub for more information.
If you are using Microsoft Active Directory as your directory, see Deploy Directory Connector for more information.
Directory Connector release notes
If Cisco Unified Communication Manage is already integrated with existing Active Directory systems, make sure those Active Directories are integrated with Webex Common Identity.
View Cluster Details
From the Manage page in Control Hub, choose a cluster to which you want to synchronize the user data with.
This selection also provides the cluster details, such as the name of the cluster, status of the cluster synchronization, last synchronized state, and the associated product.

Directory Synchronization
Depending on your requirement, you can either synchronize users from On-prem Active Directory to Control Hub using Directory Connector or directly from Azure Directory to Control Hub, and then synchronize them to Cisco Unified Communications Manager.
Perform one of the following:
To directly synchronize users from Azure Directory to Control Hub, follow Synchronize Users from Azure Directory procedure.
To synchronize users from On-prem Active Directory to Control Hub using Directory Connector, follow Synchronize Users from On-prem Active Directory procedure.
Synchronize Users from Azure Directory
Dedicated Instance Directory Service synchronization allows you to import end-user data from Azure directory into the Unified Communications Manager database such that it displays in End-User Configuration window.
To synchronize users using Azure Directory:
You need to Synchronize Azure Active Directory users into Control Hub.
Follow the procedure Configure Directory Synchronization to synchronize users in Control Hub to Cisco Unified Communications Manager.
Synchronize Users from On-prem Active Directory
On-prem Active Directory users can be synced to Common Identity (CI) using Directory Connector.

Only SSO deployment is supported for directory service. See Single Sign-On Integration in Control Hub and SAML-Based SSO Solution for more information.
To synchronize users from On-prem Active Directory:
Synchronize Active Directory users to Common Identity (CI) using Directory Connector. You can download the connector software from Control Hub and install it on your local machine. See Deployment Guide for Directory Connector for more information.
Follow the procedure in Configure Directory Synchronization synchronize users in Control Hub to Cisco Unified Communications Manager .
Configure Directory Synchronization

Sometimes, you might experience additional delays in provisioning a cluster. In such scenarios, the provisioning will still happen though this activity incurs considerable time.
Sign in to Control Hub at https://admin.webex.com/login.
Go to Services > Calling > Dedicated Instance > Manage.
Select the UC Application and click Setup under Activate Directory Sync in the right-hand panel.
In the Field-Mapping configuration window, ensure that the mapping chosen for the Unified CM User ID field uniquely identifies the user within the cluster after you start provisioning.
Choose the appropriate Unified CM User ID field mapping for synchronizing the user from Webex:
User ID field in Unified CM maps to email ID of the user in Webex.
Mail ID field in Unified CM maps to email ID of the user in Webex.
User ID field in Unified CM maps to email ID without domain part of the user in Webex.

New user account will be created if the mapping cannot be done successfully for an existing user account in Unified CM. Email ID of the user will be used as the unique identifier for the newly created user account. This note is applicable for options 1 and 2.
Options
CUCM
Webex CH
Option 1
User id field in Unified CM maps to email id of the user in Webex
Option 2
Mail id field in Unified CM maps to email ID of the user in Webex
Option 3
User id field in Unified CM maps to email ID without domain part of the user in Webex
Click Next.
Select an agreement from the drop-down list for creating a new synchronization agreement. Once the new synchronization agreement is created, all the existing synchronization agreement(s) pointing to the on-premises directory are deleted. You can make changes to the new synchronization agreement after it’s created.
In the Agreement Preview section, review the list of users and contact details (existing external LDAP directory details available in the Unified Communications Manager) before you start the synchronization. You can view the following details:
Group information

By default, all users are synchronized with User Rank 5. This can be verified in Group information window.
Applied Feature group template with universal line and device templates
Line and mask details to synced phone numbers for inserted users
Newly provisioned users and their extensions
Standard User Fields to be Synchronized section
Hostname or IP address of the directory server
Click Next to select the group filter.

Group Information section is not applicable for Cisco Unity Connection and hence will not be visible on the Agreement Preview section.
From the Select groups drop-down list, select the specific group(s) that you want to synchronize. Click the Select all groups check box if you want to select all the user groups.

By default, all the users are synchronized. If you don't select any group, all the users and associated user data will be synchronized automatically.

For Nested groups in a directory, users must select the subset user group specifically during provisioning as they aren’t included by default with the parent group. You need to verify for any repetitive nesting (if any) to ensure that only the required users are included during provisioning.
Any modifications to the synchronization agreement, for example, removing a target user or group will not be propagated during periodic synchronization. It is required to reset the Directory Service for that cluster and then re-provision the cluster with a new or modified synchronization agreement. Contact Cisco TAC support to reset the Directory Service for the required cluster.
Click Next to prepare the synchronization process.
In the Enable Synchronization window, enable the synchronization once the system successfully copies the user data into a temporary storage space in Unified CM and a new synchronization agreement is created (after steps 1 and 2 as seen in the below screen shot).
The Download report option allows you to view the results partially. To fetch the complete reports for the Unified CM cluster, execute the following CLI command: file get activelog /cm/trace/CIService/log4j/DryRunResults.csv

In case you don't have access, contact Cisco TAC support to download the report.
Here, the dry run result shows the following:
New Users—Users aren’t present in Unified CM but present in Webex Identity Service. Users are created in Unified CM after enabling synchronization.
Matched Users—Users are present in Unified CM and Webex Identity Service. These users will continue to remain active in Unified CM after synchronization is complete.
Mismatched Users—Users are present in Unified CM and Webex Identity Service. The mismatched users are marked inactive in Unified CM after synchronization is complete and will be trashed after 24 hours of inactivity.

You can check the report and decide whether you want to retain the same list of users and add or delete users. Based on the decision, click Abandon to stop the process and revert the provisioning changes.
After the synchronization agreement verification, click Preview in Unified CM to sign in to your infrastructure and make changes to the newly created synchronization agreement.

You can only edit the Group information. You cannot rename the agreement or modify any of the details.
Click Enable Synchronization to proceed with the synchronization.
During synchronization, you won’t be able to perform any action until completion. Once the synchronization is completed for a particular cluster, the Directory Service page lists this cluster with a Provisioned state. At this point, you've successfully authorized Azure AD to provision and synchronize Webex users into UC infrastructure and completed the steps to set up synchronization.

You must enable synchronization within 18 hours from the time the new agreement is created. LDAP synchronized users become inactive and removed after 24 hours of inactivity. Users won’t be able to log in and use the Unified CM services.

After the Azure AD provisioning is completed for a certain cluster, you cannot create any new synchronization agreements nor modify any configuration settings for the same cluster except for the group settings. Contact Cisco TAC support to reset the Directory Service. You can then create a new agreement for provisioning.

If you are using Azure IdP during SSO authentication after successful provisioning, ensure that you configure the right Claims in the Azure IdP. For example, during provisioning, if option 1 is selected for the userid mapping, ensure that user.userprincipalname is set as the UID in the Additional Claims section.
Periodic Synchronization
Once a cluster is successfully provisioned, periodic sync will run on a daily basis which takes care of syncing any modification to user data from Webex Common Identity to Cisco Unified Communications Manager and Cisco Unity Connection. Your intervention is not needed for periodic sync. However, you can verify if periodic sync has happened for the day by observing the Last Synchronized at column in the Cluster Details page on the Control Hub. The time stamp is updated to reflect the time at which periodic sync happened for the cluster.

Known Issues and Limitations for Webex Calling Dedicated Instance Directory Service Synchronization
If you're experiencing an issue with this feature, check to see if it's something that we already know about and have a recommended workaround.
Webex Calling Dedicated Instance Directory Service provisioning does not work with LDAP authentication as only the user data is synchronized and not the passwords for the Unified CM server and hence LDAP authentication doesn’t work.
Workaround: Single sign-on (SSO) must be used for logins. This document only covers single sign-on (SSO) integration.
Configure single sign-on (SSO) if you want your users to authenticate through their enterprise identity provider. See Single Sign-On Integration in Control Hub and SAML-Based SSO Solution for more infromation.
Contact Cisco TAC support to disable the Directory Service. Wait for a minute and then start setup of Directory Service again.
After deletion, in case you want to onboard the same Unified CM cluster to the organization again, you must first disable the Directory Service and then re-provision the same cluster.

Contact Cisco TAC support to disable the Directory Service.
In the synchronization agreement page, the Perform a sync every and Next re-sync time fields appear active. But these fields are grayed out in the Unified CM server when the Perform sync just once option is enabled. Currently, this is a limitation in the Webex Calling Dedicated Instance Directory Service provisioning feature which will be fixed in the upcoming release.
Users deleted in the Azure portal becomes inactive in Webex Identity Service but appears to be active in Unified CM.
Workaround: Go to Management > Users and delete the user from Control Hub. The user will be marked Inactive in Unified CM.
When provisioning new clusters for larger organizations (having more than 80,000 users), you will experience time-out currently. This issue will be resolved soon.
During provisioning, when you click the Abandon, Continue, and Enable Synchronization buttons on the Enable Synchronization page, status of the cluster does not change immediately in the user interface. This limitation is misleading since the actions take place in the backend.
Workaround: Avoid clicking the buttons twice and check the cluster status after few seconds. You will see that the cluster status changes from Action Required to Processing. This issue will be addressed soon.
Currently, the Enable Synchronization functionality hangs when the Unified Communications Manager network is down.
Workaround: Contact Cisco TAC support to disable the Directory Service. Wait for a minute and then start setup of Directory Service again. This issue will be fixed in the upcoming release.
During provisioning, the group details list doesn't populate due to synchronization issues with Webex Common Identity Service. Users are recommended to abandon provisioning and retry after some time.
