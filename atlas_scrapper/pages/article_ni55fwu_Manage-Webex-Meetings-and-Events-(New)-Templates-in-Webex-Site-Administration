Manage Webex Meetings and Events (New) Templates in Webex Site Administration
In this article
If a host regularly uses the same settings for scheduling a meeting or event (new) from the Webex site, Webex site administrators can save those settings as meeting or event template. Hosts can use those templates to send invites so they don’t have to enter the same settings each time.
Scheduling Templates Overview
A scheduling template defines many of the settings for a meeting or event scheduled from the Webex site. If hosts often use the same settings for their meetings or events, a site administrator can save those settings in a template. When scheduling a meeting or event, a host can select the template, so they don't have to set many of the same options for each meeting or event.
There are two types of scheduling templates:
Standard scheduling templates: Available for all hosts. A Webex service includes a set of standard templates. Site administrators can also make hosts’ personal templates available as standard templates.
Personal scheduling templates: A template that a host sets up and that is available only for that host. A host can create a personal template from within the meeting scheduler, by using the Save As Template option. When saving a template, the host can also save the template as a standard template, by selecting Save As Standard Template. The template then appears in the list of standard templates.
In the list of standard templates for Webex Meetings or Webex Events (new), site administrators can:
Show or hide any standard template, including those templates that hosts create and save as a standard template.
Make any standard template the default template for Webex Meetings or Webex Events (new).
Delete a standard template from a Webex site.

When you make a template visible or set it as default, you must make the same changes in each language if you want your site to be consistent for every language. For example, making changes in English will not result in the same changes appearing when you sign in to your site in French.
