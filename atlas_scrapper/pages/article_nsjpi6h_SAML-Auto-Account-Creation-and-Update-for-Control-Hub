SAML Auto Account Creation and Update for Control Hub
You can use SAML to map user attributes from IdP to Webex identity attributes, and turn on just-in-time (JIT) auto account updates using SAML assertion.
Modify Single sign-on authentication in Control Hub
Before you begin
Ensure that the following preconditions are met:
SSO is already configured. For information on using the SSO configuration wizard, see the section "SSO Setup" here: https://help.webex.com/article/lfu88u/.
The domains have already been verified.
The domains are claimed and turned on. This feature ensures users from your domain are created and updated once each time they authenticate with your IdP.
If DirSync or AzureAD are enabled then SAML JIT create or update will not work.
"Block user profile update" is enabled. SAML Update Mapping is allowed because this configuration controls the userâ€™s ability to edit the attributes. Admin-controlled methods of creation and update are still supported.

  Newly created users won't automatically get assigned licenses unless the organization has an automatic license template set up.
