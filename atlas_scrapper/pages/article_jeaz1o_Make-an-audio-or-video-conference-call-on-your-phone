Make an audio or video conference call on your phone
In this article
Conference calling
Collaboration is an important part of any job. Rather than setting up a formal meeting by sending out invitations and booking conference rooms, you can make an audio or video conference call from your desk or conference phone at any time. You can create conference calls with a maximum of six people, including yourself.

Video capable endpoints include IP phones, Webex App, and Webex Rooms devices. These are joined with video when you initiate a conference call.
When you create a conference call, you see two separate Cisco Webex spaces for each individual call. If you want to collaborate in a space, create one for the three of you.
