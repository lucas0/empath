Migrate Your Phone to Webex Calling
In this article
Device Firmware Migration Overview
Perform the new and automated device firmware migration from Control Hub, so that you can migrate your enterprise devices to cloud. You can migrate the required Enterprise Firmware phones to Multiplatform Phone (MPP) Firmware from Control Hub. MPP phones are powered by Webex Calling solutions.
MPP firmware can run on certain models of the Cisco IP Phone 6800, 7800, and 8800 series. However, only the Cisco IP Phone 7800 and 8800 series have the capability to run either MPP firmware or Enterprise firmware. If you have the appropriate license, you can migrate between the MPP or Enterprise firmware on the Cisco IP Phone 7800 and 8800 series.

7800 firmware migration requires that the 7800 model is the correct hardware version.
This feature helps to migrate the registration of a phone from one of the following devices to Webex Calling:
Unified CM with on-premises calling
Unified CM with hosted calling using Hosted Collaboration Solution.
Cloud calling via Spark Calling
Use the migration wizard on Control Hub to prepare your devices for migration. The migration wizard automates the device license generation and checks the device eligibility before you start the migration. This tool helps you to migrate your devices and assign it to the existing Webex users or workspaces.

All phones that are migrated to MPP firmware using this tool must use Webex Calling.
Prerequisites
