Provision content management
You can configure content management settings for collaboration for individual users or your enterprise.
Overview
Configure content management
Known issues
When you configure your content management settings in Control Hub, you can control your Webex, Google Drive, Microsoft, and Box storage settings in one place. For the third-party content management options, you can select the default sharing behavior. There's also a control to allow users to change the default, or prevent them from changing it.
By default, local files and screen captures that your users share in the Webex App app are stored in Webex App storage. When you purchase Pro Pack for Cisco Webex Control Hub , you can disable this option to prevent users from uploading local files and the content is no longer stored in Webex App storage. You can also disable the screen capture option in the Webex app and the screen capture content are not stored in Webex App storage.
Whiteboards and annotations are always stored in Webex App storage.
We support the following enterprise content management platforms:
Microsoft—OneDrive, SharePoint Online
You can allow your users' access to content in your enterprise content management platform.
You can optionally choose a specific Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant, and your users can only use a work or school account from this specified Azure AD tenant when they sign in to your content management platform.
For more detailed information on Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-protocols#endpoints
Box
You can allow your users' access to content in your enterprise content management platform.

  Webex for Government doesn't support Box.
Google Drive
You can allow your Webex App users to share, preview, and collaborate on Google Drive files directly in a space.

  Webex for Government doesn't support Google Drive.
Access considerations
The following are access requirements to consider for users accessing your enterprise content management platform:
Access outside of your corporate network
When your Azure AD tenant administrator configures conditional access by only allowing users to access content on their corporate network or to connect to the corporate network over VPN, users get the following error message: Your sign in was successful but does not meet the criteria to access this resource.
For more information, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/ .
Conditional access support for device signals
As Webex Teams supports device signals for conditional access, your Azure administrator can apply policies to ensure that users sign in to your enterprise content management system from Webex Teams on specific devices that are enabled for conditional access. This is supported on Webex Teams for Windows and Mac.
For more information, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/ .
Proxy support for enterprise content management
When you use a proxy to connect to Webex App, you must contact our Customer Support to enable proxy support for enterprise content management for your organization.
Permissions for third-party applications
Permissions for Microsoft—OneDrive, SharePoint Online
By default, Azure AD tenants are configured to allow users to provide consent to third-party multi-tenant applications. However, if your tenant administrator chooses to restrict consent, then an end user can't sign into their Azure AD account in Webex App and they receive the following error message:
This consent doesn't authorize Webex App to access anyone's data explicitly. Webex App requests delegated permission on behalf of the signed-in user.
Choose one of the following ways to provide administrator consent:
In a browser, you can enter: https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/adminconsent?client_id=40830e92-8323-4b43-abd5-ca6b81d39b75&state=12345&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fbinaries.webex.com%2Fstatic-content-pipeline%2Fenterprise-content-management%2Fproduction%2Fmicrosoft%2Fwxt-ecm.html
For more information, see Permissions and Consent in the Azure Active Directory v2.0 Endpoint
When permission is granted, your browser's URL field displays:
https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient?admin_consent=True&tenant=fc7e9060-290c-4c4d-923c-da313cfbb318&state=12345
