Connect your Cisco Headset 700 Series to a Bluetooth ® device
Put your headset into pairing mode to make it discoverable to other Bluetooth ® devices.
To get the most out of your headset, download and set up the Cisco Headsets app on your mobile device.
Your headset can save up to eight different Bluetooth ® devices and maintain simultaneous connections with up to two devices at once.
For information on how to remove paired Bluetooth devices, see Delete paired device from your Cisco Headset 700 Series.

  If your headset is running firmware version 1-7 or earlier and already has two active Bluetooth sources, you must disconnect one before you can save another Bluetooth device to your headset. With firmware 1-8 or later, the older of the two disconnected sources will drop to enable pairing to a new device.
1
Slide up and hold the Power/Bluetooth switch for two seconds.
The Cisco Headset 730 Bluetooth LED blinks when the headset is in pairing mode.
2
Enable Bluetooth on your device.
You can enable and disable Bluetooth from the Settings menu on most call devices.
3
Select your headset from the device list.
By default, your headset will appear in the device list with the last three digits of your headset serial number. You can customize your device name through the Cisco Headsets mobile app.
