Assign services to managed gateways
In this article
Introduction
After successful enrollment, you can assign a Webex Calling service to a managed gateway to enable new functionality or to benefit from enhanced management.
Two services are currently available: Local Gateway, which brings enhanced visibility of Cisco Local Gateway platforms to Control Hub; and Survivability Gateway, which enables a Cisco router to provide call survivability features for sites in the event of service interruption.
