Block inbound spam calls
In this article
Webex Calling supports blocking inbound calls coming from Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). You can reject certain calls based on the incoming calling number.
Overview of the call block list
Here are few benefits with this feature:
Webex Calling customer administrators can block incoming PSTN calls from numbers which are either spam or harassing. You can configure policies for an organization to block calls from one of the following numbers:
Configured numbers, for example: telemarketing callers or collection agencies
Known offenders such as disgruntled customers or ex-employees
Blocking these calls help to reduce time in answering these calls, and protect the users from security threats or harassment.
Webex Calling rejects an external (PSTN) call coming in from blocked numbers, which are defined in the call block list in Control Hub or the User blocklist in Webex App. See Webex App | Block calls for details. The callers are disconnected and may hear an announcement depending on the PSTN type (Local or Cisco PSTN) used by their organization and the local PSTN provider. The calling numbers (coming from the PSTN trunks) are matched against the locally configured E164 patterns that is defined on Control Hub. For a successful match and call rejection, specify the calling number coming from the PSTN trunk in an equivalent E164 format. If the number schema used by your PSTN provider is non-E164, use the normalization rules at the Local gateway (for on-premise PSTN trunks) before sending the calls to Webex Calling.
Webex Calling can block calls in these scenarios:
Calls from anonymous numbers where the calling information isn’t available in the SIP From/P-Asserted-Id headers.
Calls with the presentation status marked as private. (The Privacy header is marked as id).
You can make an outbound call to the blocked numbers.

For calls routed between Webex Calling and premises, set the Calling > Service Settings to Standard Behavior. If set to Legacy mode, external calls coming through a PSTN gateway are considered as local calls coming from On-Premises.
Create a block list
Configure a block list with numbers that can’t make incoming calls to your organization.
1
From the administrator view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Services > Calling.
2
Go to Service settings and scroll down to Call Block List.
You can add or remove phone numbers, country codes, or other patterns to the call block list. Ensure that the numbers and patterns are in E164 format.
Block calls with no caller ID—This option blocks incoming calls from PSTN without calling line information (Caller ID).
Block calls from hidden private numbers—This option blocks all calls from callers with private numbers or hidden identities.
3
Select Add to add numbers or patterns to block from calling the user's organization. The Add numbers to call block list window displays.
Follow these guidelines for adding numbers or patterns:
Enter patterns in E164 format.
Wildcards include the use of ! which represents a sequence of one or more digits.
X represents a single number (0-9).
You can add up to 200 numbers or patterns per organization. To add numbers in bulk, select Import CSV.
Numbers and patterns added to the block list is visible above the input field. Each number is validated as you enter them.
When you don’t enter any blocked numbers, a notification stating that there are no current blocked numbers added to this customer organization displays.
4
Click Save, to save the number. To remove a number, select . Save is enabled after entering the first valid number.
A list with all the blocked numbers displays. You can view upto 20 numbers at a time.
5
Click Delete, to delete an entry or use Clear all, to delete all numbers in the block list. A notification displays to confirm the action.
Manage block list in bulk
Administrators can create an enterprise-wide call block list from the Control Hub using the bulk upload option. Users can now create a personalized block list from Webex App or the Webex client. All blocked numbers from both the administrators and users are stored in the database. Every incoming calling number is matched against the primary line of the owner’s block list and appropriately the blocks the calls.
The administrator can use a CSV file to bulk import a blocklist. You can access the Bulk Manage option from:
The Call Block List section of the Calling Organization settings page
The Add Number modal window
1
In https://admin.webex.com, go to Services > Calling.
2
Go to Service settings and scroll down to Call Block List.
3
Select Bulk Manage. The Bulk Add Numbers and Patterns window displays.
4
Click the Download Data button, to add call block numbers. Click Download.csv template, to download the template and modify the spreadsheet to add numbers and patterns. You can add up to 200 numbers or patterns. Save the file and upload it.
For a valid .csv file, the Upload button is enabled. Click Upload, and all changes apply to the block list.
5
You can also access the Bulk Manage option from the Add Number modal window.
Points to consider when using the Call Block List:
A parked call is present either as the parking user or a provisioned hunt group, if the parked call is not retrieved. This is called a recall.
No blocking services are invoked when recall is directed to the parking user.
Admin block doesn’t apply for recalling a parking user, and is irrelevant.
User block doesn’t apply for recalling a parking user, and is irrelevant. If the parking user blocks the caller, then parking call can’t happen.
Admin block applies for recall of hunt group only when the caller ID changes.
Troubleshoot blocking inbound spam calls
Use these steps to troubleshoot issues with blocking inbound spam calls. If the functionality isn’t working, then use the potential workarounds or solutions to resolve the issue.
Issue: Webex Calling doesn’t block incoming PSTN calls although the numbers are configured in the Call Block List.
Workaround/Resolution:
Check the configured patterns in the Control Hub under Call Block List.
Ensure that the E164 number pattern exactly matches the calling number that you’re trying to block.
When using a wildcard pattern X, the number of digits must match with the number of X characters that you’ve configured.
For example, if you want to block all numbers coming in from NPA-NXX 212-505, then use an E164 format of +1212505XXXX.
Check with your PSTN provider on the use of E164 numbering formats. If the provider is using National numbering schemes, then deploy the normalization rules at the Local Gateway trunk before sending the incoming PSTN call to Webex Calling.
A sample normalization rule (IOS-XE SIP Profile to transform the From Header into an E164 format) for reference:
