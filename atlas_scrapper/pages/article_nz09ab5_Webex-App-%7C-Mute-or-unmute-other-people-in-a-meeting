Webex App | Mute or unmute other people in a meeting
Sometimes attendees are in a noisy environment or have a setup that's causing feedback and don't realize it. You can prevent disruptive, noisy feedback by muting everyone as they join the meeting, muting everyone in the meeting, or muting specific people.
Mute or unmute all attendees in a meeting
During a classic meeting associated with a space, anyone can select Mute All. Then, everyone except for the person muting and the current presenter, gets muted.
In a Webex scheduled meeting, Personal Room meeting, or enhanced meeting associated with a space, only the host or cohost can select Mute All. If you mute everyone as the host or cohost, everyone, except you and the current presenter, gets muted.

  Weâ€™ve enhanced the meeting experience in a space. Some of you may still have the classic experience. For more information on the enhanced experience, see meetings associated with a space.
