Configure The Webex App's Default Landing Screen
In this article
About the Webex App Default Landing Screen
The "Landing Screen" refers to the main window of the Webex app, and it can show any of the following:
Messaging
Contacts
Calling
Meetings
Users may not be able to see the default tab
The Webex app does not expose services for which the user is not licensed, so it's possible that the default landing screen you select is not visible to some of your users.
In this case, the affected users land on the screen that shows the highest placed service that they are licensed for (the order is the same as the above list). For example, if you select Meetings as the default landing screen, users who are not licensed for meetings see the messaging screen when they open the Webex app.
Changes take time to propagate
When you change these settings, you may wait up to eight hours for the change to apply to all users. In practice it is not usually this long.
The app remembers the user's choice
The user only needs to set the landing screen when they want to change it. The app remembers the choice.
If you subsequently prevent users from changing their default landing screen, the app will take your choice from Control Hub instead. If you change it again to allow the user to choose, the app remembers what they chose before.
Mobile / Web versions of the Webex app do not support this feature
The default landing screen feature is supported on the Windows and Mac versions of the Webex app.
