Look Up Your Organization ID in Cisco Webex Control Hub
As a partner, there are a few occasions when you need to reference your organization ID. If you don't have a record of your organization ID, you can find it easily in Control Hub.
For example, if you're a service provider, you'll need your organization ID to complete the Webex Calling enablement. You may also need to reference your ID if you're having trouble accessing the Webex Calling Partner HelpDesk.
Before you begin
You must be an existing Webex partner and be set up in Cisco Webex Control Hub in order to access your organization ID. If you're not set up, you must place a subscription order in Cisco Commerce Workspace (CCW) for either the Cisco Unified Workspace for Partners (CUWP) or the Not for Resale (NFR) Demo Program.

If you're provisioning Webex Calling services, you must use the NFR Demo Program.
