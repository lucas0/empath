Turn activation emails on or off in Control Hub
Webex sends automated emails when licenses are assigned to users in Control Hub. If you turn this setting off, you'll need to send out your own communications instead.
The setting to automatically send emails is on by default. An email is automatically sent out to all newly added users. In this context, a newly added user is a user who has been assigned any free or paid licenses and has never logged into the Webex app before. These users aren't likely to have created a password, and may still need to verify their email addresses.

  It is highly recommended that you turn this setting off only if you have a well-thought-out system in place to manually onboard the users.
If you turn this setting off, an email won't be automatically sent out to newly added users. Instead, you can send activation emails to onboard a user individually or in bulk. These communications won't have the right email verification links or password creation logic, so we highly recommend leaving this setting on to utilize automatically generated activation emails.

  You can only suppress emails that are sent to new licensed users or inactive users, not the emails sent to users who converted from a free to a paid plan.
1
Sign in to Control Hub, then select Organization settings and scroll to Email.
2
Toggle Automatic activation emails on or off.

  If you decide to turn this setting off, you'll need to send activation emails to your users individually or in bulk.
Best practices for manually sending activation emails
If you decide to turn this setting off and manually send activation emails, you should include these details:
Your company's goals and plan for the rollout.
The value and purpose of Webex App.
If you have purchased Webex App with Webex Meetings, include the link to the Personal Meeting Room (PMR).
Internal support links for your users.
Links to internal training content for users.
Link to the end user portal: https://settings.webex.com.
Instructions for users to activate their account. They sign in on the SSO page using their company credentials and are automatically signed in to Webex App.
Tips for tracking inactive users
For inactive users, Control Hub provides the ability to send out reminder email invites. As these reminder email invites are suppressed, you must track these inactive users and send out reminder email invites manually.
Conversion from free to paid users
When users converted from free to paid users, the email invites are not suppressed, as users have to be notified of the conversion.
