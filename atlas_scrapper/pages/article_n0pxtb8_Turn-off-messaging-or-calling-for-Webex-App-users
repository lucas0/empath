Turn off messaging or calling for Webex App users
About messaging and calling feature licenses
We entitle all customers to use basic messaging and calling features in Webex, at no cost. In a single app, users get a consistent experience with quick access to everything essential (documents, discussions, voicemails, meeting invitations, recordings, and more). The app provides continuity in conversations without needing to switch apps, increasing productivity.
While we recommend that our customers use the full Webex App, we understand that you might need to turn off certain functionality to roll out Webex slowly across the org, if you're using a different app for those functions, or for compliance reasons.
As an administrator with User Management access, you can turn off the following features by removing licenses:
Basic Messaging (also disables Basic Space Meetings)
Basic Calling
Basic Messaging and Basic Calling (also disables Basic Space Meetings)
You can remove these licenses using any of the available methods to assign or modify licenses in Control Hub, or by using the APIs.
