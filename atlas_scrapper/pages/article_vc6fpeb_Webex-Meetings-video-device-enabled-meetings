Webex Meetings video device-enabled meetings
Anyone with Webex Meetings can attend meetings using any SIP- or H.323-based video system. Whether you use Cisco, Polycom, or other video providers, easily start or connect to a Webex meeting.
Up to 500 video devices can join a meeting. In addition to that, depending on your deployment, up to 1,000 video-enabled mobile and desktop participants, and 500 audio-only participants can join. Video device participants count towards your meeting size limit, and towards the 500 video devices limit. Participants who join from Webex App also count as a video device.

  Cisco Webex video platform version 2.0 is required. Check the video platform version of your Webex site.
Meetings that take place in your Personal Room use a permanent URL and video address. Scheduled meetings use a temporary URL and video address.
