Hand off interpreting to the next interpreter in Webex meetings and webinars
Interpreting requires a lot of effort and focus. If a meeting or webinar takes longer than 30 minutes, multiple interpreters may be assigned to your language by the host. The interpreters in your audio channel can take turns interpreting so that you maintain high quality interpretation for attendees.
Each interpreter for your assigned language gets moved to the same audio channel so that you can hear each other as well as the original meeting audio. When it's time for the next interpreter to begin, hand off interpretation duties to them so ensure a smooth transition for attendees.
The host determines the order of interpreters. The host can also manage the order in the meeting. Interpreter 1 can hand off to interpreter 2, then interpreter 3, then back to interpreter 1, and so on.
