Resize the stage in meetings, webinars, and events
If you're having difficulty seeing the active speaker, shared content, or participants that you added to the stage, adjust how large or small they appear.
When you use Stack or Side by side view, the active speaker or shared content appear in the main video, called the stage. To learn more about the stage, see Video layouts in Webex Meetings, Webex Webinars, and Webex Events (classic) or Webex App | Change your video layout during a meeting.
If you move people to the stage, the people you added and the active speaker or shared content share the stage. The active speaker or shared content appears on the left and the people you added appear on the right. You can increase or decrease the size of each side of the stage. Making one side of the stage bigger makes the other side of the stage smaller.
This feature is available for Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environments for Webex App only.
