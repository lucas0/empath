Webex App | Delete a Space
While using Webex App, you may want to get rid of an outdated or unneeded standalone space, if it's a team space you must remove it from the team first. A space gets deleted when all members leave it, including you. People can choose to leave, or you can remove people if you're the moderator or the space is unmoderated.
Space Content
After a space is deleted, all messages and shared files are also deleted. The length of time that content is stored for and when it's deleted is based on the space policy of your organization.
For Moderators
To delete a space, all members must have left. If you're the last moderator of a team space, the option to leave the space is disabled. You must first either unmoderate the space or promote someone else to moderate it.
