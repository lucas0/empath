Webex App | Make work calls over a mobile phone connection
If your administrator has set you up with Dial-via-Office (DvO), you can choose how calls happen in Webex App. You can make work calls using your mobile phone connection, which ensures your calls are uninterrupted, even if data is unavailable. So when you make a call in Webex App, you're immediately called back. No matter what option you choose, your work number is always used as the caller ID so people can easily identify you.
On your desktop app, add your mobile number or the number of another device as a Single Number Reach number. For information about how to set this up, go here and look at the Unified CM section under the Desktop tab.
