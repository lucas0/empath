Webex App | Add your profile picture
Make it easier for people to recognize you in Webex App by adding a picture to your profile. Until you upload one, your profile only shows your initials inside a circle.
You can use lots of common graphic formats for your picture: .jpg, .png, .gif, or .bmp. Or use the camera on your phone to take a quick selfie.
The file has to be under 10 MB for desktop and 1 MB for mobile, and should ideally be a square image. Webex App resizes your file to use in Webex App.
If your picture doesn't change for you, it could be the file size. Or, your picture may be set through your organizations directory and you'll need to contact your administrator to change it.
If other people don't see your changed picture, it's probably down to the local caching on their apps, the change can take up to four hours to show for other users.
Depending on your administrator settings, after you add a profile picture you can remove it. If not, you can only replace your profile picture. For more information, see Webex App | Remove your profile picture.
