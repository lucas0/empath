Enable Force Authentication for Webex with Directory Connector in Control Hub
Make your organization more secure by enabling force authentication when users change their passwords for Webex. Users have to sign in to the Webex app again once the new passwords are detected by Directory Connector.
Before you begin
You must have Directory Synchronization and single sign-on (SSO) set up for your organization to enable this setting.
1
From the customer view in https://admin.webex.com, go to Organization Settings.
2
Scroll down to the Directory Synchronization section and toggle Force authentication when users change passwords to on.
