Upgrade from Webex Contact Center 1.0 to Webex Contact Center
In this article
Upgrade Overview
You can migrate from the Webex Contact Center 1.0 legacy platform to the new Webex Contact Center platform.
After you agree to upgrade to the new platform, you are enrolled in the upgrade program and the upgrade feature is enabled for your tenant. The upgrade process consists of three stages:
Pre-Upgrade Setup: The first step of the upgrade process is to execute the Pre-Upgrade Setup from the Contact Center > Settings section on Control Hub.
The Pre-Upgrade Setup workflow performs the following tasks:
Ensures that the existing tenant settings are carried forward during upgrade.
Provisions the Management Portal instance on the new platform.
Copies the existing tenant configurations from the Management Portal on the legacy platform and makes them available on the new platform.
Provisions voice and digital channels on the new platform.
Creates accounts for all agents on the new platform.
After the Pre-Upgrade Setup completes, you have access to the features of the new platform.
For more information, see Perform the Pre-Upgrade Setup.
New Platform Setup: In this stage, you configure and start using the new platform. You either reuse the configurations that were copied from the legacy platform or you create new configurations. Do the following:
Assign agents to teams and assign appropriate agent, multimedia, and skill profiles to the agents.
Create routing strategies using the new Flow Control application.
Add Contact Routing Settings to queues to distribute the contacts to the appropriate teams and agents.
After the agent and contact routing configurations are in place, you move agents to the new platform and route Voice, Chat, and Email contacts to the new platform.

If you have some users on the legacy platform and some users on the new platform, the calls can't be transferred or conferenced between the two platforms. For more information, see Upgrade Considerations and Warnings.
For more information, see New Platform Setup.
Post-Upgrade Cleanup: After you’re comfortable with the new platform and don’t need access to the legacy platform resources, you must perform a Post-Upgrade Cleanup. Execute the Post-Upgrade Cleanup from the Contact Center > Settings section on Control Hub. The Post-Upgrade Cleanup workflow performs the following tasks:
Decommissions the Management Portal on the legacy platform and all associated applications.
Cleans up data that are associated with the customer tenant for the legacy platform.
Makes call recordings from the legacy platform accessible from the Recording Management application on the new platform.
Makes Analyzer data from the legacy platform accessible from the Analyzer application on the new platform.
For more information, see Perform the Post-Upgrade Cleanup.

When setting up the new platform, real-time reports for active entry points on the legacy platform show no data. The entry points are inactive on the new platform.
