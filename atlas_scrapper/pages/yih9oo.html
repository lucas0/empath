Save a transcript in a meeting
You can allow meeting participants to save a transcript during a Webex meeting without recording the meeting.
This is available for Webex meetings on the Video Mesh-ready platform.
1
Sign in to Control Hub, then under Services, click Meeting.
2
Click Settings, then under Meeting transcript download, toggle on Allow in-meeting transcript download.

  Users in a meeting will see a notification pop up if someone has turned on closed captions. They can then save and share the transcript.
If you disable closed captions for certain users (such as the host) or groups in a meeting template, those users or groups cannot see closed captions or the Captions panel in a meeting, and they cannot save a transcript. For more information, see Collaboration restrictions for Webex Meetings in Control Hub and Configure settings templates.
If the Captions panel is disabled for your site, closed captions are still shown in a meeting, but no one can save a transcript.
