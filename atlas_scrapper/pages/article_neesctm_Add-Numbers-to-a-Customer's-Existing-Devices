Add Numbers to a Customer's Existing Devices
You can add PSTN to the Cisco Webex desk and room devices in your customer organization at any time, such as a Cisco Webex DX80 or a Cisco TelePresence SX10 Quick Set.
Whether they're in the middle of a trial and have access to 10 free PSTN numbers or have been converted to a paid subscription, all you have to do is follow a few steps to enable calling on their devices.
Before you begin
PSTN on Cisco IP phones and Cisco Webex desk and room devices is only available in the United States.
