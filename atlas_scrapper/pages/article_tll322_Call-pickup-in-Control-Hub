Call pickup in Control Hub
You can enhance teamwork and collaboration by creating call pickups. Users that are added to a call pickup can answer calls when another member of the call pickup is busy.
Group call pickup enables a user to answer any ringing line within their pickup group. A pickup group is a group administrator-defined set of users within a Site, to which the call pickup feature applies. The group call pickup feature requires call pickup groups to be added, modified, and removed as well as assigning specific users to that pickup group.
Create a call pickup
Call pickups must meet the following conditions:
A user can only be assigned to one call pickup.
A call pickup can only have users from the same location.
A location may have multiple call pickups.
Call pickup names must be unique.
