Webex App | Make a call from an alternate device
If your administrator lets you use alternate devices (otherwise known as Extend and Connect), you can make and receive calls using another device, such as the phone in your hotel room or your home phone, while leveraging the calling capabilities in Webex App. You don't need to be connected to your work network and your work number is always used as the caller ID so people can easily identify you.
