Configure Moving a Webex Call into a Meeting
When users are on a call with someone who's internal or external to their organization, they can take advantage of advanced meeting features such as transcriptions, real-time translations, notes, action items, recordings, and whiteboarding. They can move that call into a full-featured meeting. Before moving a call into a meeting, they can even invite other people into the discussion. This feature requires administrators to configure specific Webex site requirements.
You can configure your Webex site, so that your users can move a Webex call into a meeting.
1
Ensure that your Webex Meetings site is on a minimum of 41.3 or later.
To check your meeting version, use the steps in Determine Your Webex Site Version in Cisco Webex Control Hub.

  Moving a call into a meeting won't work in the following Webex Meetings site configurations:
Encryption is set to End-to-End or PKI.
Telephony is enabled.
The site is on the slow-release channel. See Manage Software Release Channels, for more information.
2
Enable the full-featured meetings experience for any users who want to move calls to meetings.
New customers are automatically enabled with this experience. Earlier organizations must opt in for this step. Reach out to your partner or CSM for guidance.
Remote users being added to a meeting do not require this feature.
3
Users must set their default Webex site using these steps.
