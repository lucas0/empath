Webex App | Hide names with reactions
When a participant uses reactions during a meeting, the participant's name shows next to the reaction that they sent. As the meeting host or cohost, if you prefer, hide the names so that only the reaction shows.
For more information about reactions, see Use reactions in your meetings.
This feature is available on our Video Mesh-ready meeting platform. Find out if your meetings use the Video Mesh-ready meeting platform.
