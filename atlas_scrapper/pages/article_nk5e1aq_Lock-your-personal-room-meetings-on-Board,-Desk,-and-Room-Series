Lock your personal room meetings on Board, Desk, and Room Series
Locking personal room meetings helps keep them secure by preventing uninvited participants from joining. When your meeting is locked, the guests wait in the lobby until you let them in.
As a host or co-host you can lock and unlock personal room meetings. When a meeting is locked, you can let people in from the participant list.
When youâ€™re having a call in your personal room, tap the screen on your device to get the call controls. Tap More and then select Lock meeting.
Your personal room is now locked. To let people in tap the participants list in the call controls and select Let in. To unlock your personal room tap More and then select Unlock meeting.
