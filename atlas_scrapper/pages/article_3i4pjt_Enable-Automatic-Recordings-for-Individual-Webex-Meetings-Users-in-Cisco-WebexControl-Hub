Enable Automatic Recordings for Individual Webex Meetings Users in Cisco Webex Control Hub
As a site administrator, you can turn on automatic recordings for individual users, instead of turning on automatic recording for the whole site.
When recordings for individual users is enabled, every meeting, event, or training session that the user hosts is recorded. The recording starts when the meeting begins and canâ€™t be stopped or paused, after the meeting starts.
Before you begin
