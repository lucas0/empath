Webex App | Move a meeting to another desktop or mobile device
Seamlessly move a meeting from one desktop or mobile device to another without disrupting or disconnecting from the meeting. For example, if you commute to work and join a meeting on your mobile device, move the meeting to your laptop when you get to the office. Or, if you need to step away from your computer during a meeting, move the meeting to your mobile device.
This feature is available on our Video Mesh-ready meeting platform. Find out if your meetings use the Video Mesh-ready meeting platform.
Make sure you sign in to your Webex account on each device.
If you connect your desktop or mobile device to a video system, you can't move a meeting to that device.
If search took you here but you're looking for information about moving your meeting to a video device, you can do that too.
