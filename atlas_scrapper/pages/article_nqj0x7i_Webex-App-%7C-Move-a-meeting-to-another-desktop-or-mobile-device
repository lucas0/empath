Webex App | Move a meeting to another desktop or mobile device
Seamlessly move a meeting from one desktop or mobile device to another without disrupting or disconnecting from the meeting. For example, if you commute to work and join a meeting on your mobile device, move the meeting to your laptop when you get to the office. Or, if you need to step away from your computer during a meeting, move the meeting to your mobile device.
