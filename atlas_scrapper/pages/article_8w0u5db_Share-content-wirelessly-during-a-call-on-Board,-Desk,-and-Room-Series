Share content wirelessly during a call on Board, Desk, and Room Series
You can share wirelessly to your personal mode Cisco device from your Cisco Webex app.
With wireless sharing from your Webex app, you don't need to connect cables or connect the app to your device. Sharing to your personal mode Board, Desk, or Room Series device works from Windows or Mac.

This share button only appears if you have started the call from your personal mode device. When you start the call from a connected Webex app, you can share from the app the usual way.
1
When youâ€™ve started a call from a device that is registered to you, the call shows up on top of your spaces list in the Webex app. Click the Share button and select if you want to share a specific app or the entire screen.

To stop sharing, click Stop on the top of your laptop screen.
