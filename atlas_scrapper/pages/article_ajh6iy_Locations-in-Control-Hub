Locations in Control Hub
Locations allow you to organize users and workspaces based on a physical location. You can configure both calling and workspace management functions into the same location.
Locations help you arrange your organizationâ€™s workforce into logical groupings. For example, a multinational enterprise may have multiple offices around the world, each with markedly different Webex collaboration requirements.
Users and workspaces can be assigned to a location, identified by a physical address. For example, you may want to create a Headquarters location identified by an address in a specific city. Users in your organization can be assigned that location as their home office. Workspaces can be physical areas within that location, such as the Main conference room workspace in the Headquarters location.
In addition to the organizational benefits of locations, you can use a single location for both calling and workspaces. You can also apply settings templates and other administrative features to groups and locations.
