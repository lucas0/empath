Reference
Chat messages that are sent to Everyone in an internal meeting are saved by default after the meeting has ended. Users can search and easily access meeting notes, questions, decisions, action items, and chat, whether or not they attended the meeting. Attendees that join late don't miss important content, as they can still see the chat from the time the meeting started.
Saved chats are subject to compliance and are governed by an organization's meeting retention policy.
For more information about who can access saved chats, see Webex App | Chat in a meeting.
