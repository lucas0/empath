Webex App | Quote someone's message
If you need to add context to a message that you’re responding to, you can quote someone’s message and reply directly to their comment. The quoted message shows the person’s name and indents their original comment when you add your reply.

  The option to quote messages with content is currently not supported on Webex for Government.
You can still quote messages that include files, GIFs and images. However, the content won't be displayed, but you'll see the file type that was shared in the original message.

  You can also see where a quoted message was originally posted. If you see a quoted message in a space, click or tap Go to message to see the original message in context.

Click Quote, to the right of the message that you want to quote.
You can quote messages that contain files, GIFs, and images. There is a file size limit of 100 MB, and you can quote messages that contain up to 10 files. Block quotes can also be quoted, but you can only include one quote at a time in your draft message.

Type your message and click Enter to reply directly to that comment.

  If you start a message with quoted content but don't send it right away, the quoted content isn't saved as part of the draft message. Also, if you are quoting a message which has formatted text, the formatting will not be shown in the composition space, but will be displayed once the message is sent.
