Use DTMF commands in your Personal Room meetings
You can use DTMF commands during your Personal Room meetings on your phone. Mute and unmute yourself, find out how many participants are in the meeting, get tech support, and more.
On WBS39.6 and later sites, DTMF controls are available in Personal Room meetings only for participants who join with their phone.

The full set of DTMF controls is available only when you start your Personal Room meeting from your phone. If you start your meeting from the Webex desktop or mobile app and use Call me or Call in to connect to your phone, you can use *6 only.
