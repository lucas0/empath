Show the front and back camera of your mobile device in Webex Meetings
Show your front and back camera at the same time during a meeting so that when you use your mobile device's back camera, you can remain on screen.
Currently, only the Meetings app for iOS supports dual camera. Your iOS device must be on iOS 12 or later and have an A12 or later processor to support capturing multiple cameras simultaneously.
