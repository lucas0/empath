Webex App | Adjust the maximum number of participants you see per page in grid layout
During a meeting, show up to 81 participants per page in grid layout. The fewer participants you show, the larger their video is. This feature is supported only on Mac, Windows, and Linux.
Grid layout automatically adjusts to the number of participants in the meeting. By default, a maximum of 25 videos are displayed in a 5x5 grid, but you can adjust this number.
During a meeting, go to Settings > Meetings > Layout.
Set the default number by choosing a value from the drop-down list.
When you increase or decrease the number of participants to show, you set the maximum number that can appear.
Click Increase or decrease video size and use the slider to adjust the number of participants that show in the grid.

  If the user's internet connection or desktop has insufficient resources, the maximum number of videos displayed per page will be automatically reduced to preserve the video quality of each video.
When you set your self view to Show with others, your self-view always shows first, in the upper-left corner of the first page. If you increase the video size to show only one participant per page, then only the active speaker displays on the first page.

  You don't need to be in a meeting to adjust the maximum number of participants to show in grid layout. You can do it anytime and the change applies to all your future meetings in Webex App. Go to your profile picture, select Meetings > Layout. Choose your option, then click Save.
