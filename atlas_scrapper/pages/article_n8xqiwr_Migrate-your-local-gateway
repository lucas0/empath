Migrate your local gateway
The Webex Calling platform includes upgraded cloud infrastructure that your premise-based local gateways connect to. This upgrade improves service and enables several new features for the local gateway.
The improvements of this new infrastructure include:
Improved call-handling performance, allowing up to 250 concurrent sessions per local gateway registration.
Supports the use of Webex Calling Media Optimization for calls between desk phones, the Webex app, and a local gateway.
Specifications:
A new list of proxy addresses has been released. A proxy address is a static DNS record that is obtained from Control Hub during the onboarding process of a local gateway and then configured on a local gatewayâ€™s tenant configuration for registering the gateway.
Webex Calling cloud operations is requesting customers to migrate local gateways that use an older proxy address. Details are outlined in the following sections.
