Webex Meetings Suite System Requirements
Here's what you need to know about the requirements to join and host meetings. We've put together information about minimum browser and OS requirements, supported email applications, and supported languages.
Operating system and browser support for the Webex Meetings Suite
Supported operating systems
Windows
Windows Server 2008 64-bit
Windows Server 2008 R2 64-bit
Windows 10
Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB
Windows 11
Notes:
Windows OS support on Microsoft Surface Pro is supported.
Each Webex Meetings monthly release is tested and certified against the current preview of monthly rollup and all semi-annual Windows 10 releases.
Webex Meetings supports Windows Server 2012 R2 and 2016 with limitation that, for Webex meetings, Productivity Tools, and the desktop application, if a user doesn't have administrator privileges, then an administrator is required to install the Webex Meetings applications and Productivity Tools.
Mac OS X
10.13
10.14
10.15
11.0 (Big Sur)
12.0 (Monterey)

  FedRAMP-compliant Webex Meetings sites require Mac OS 10.13 or later.
Starting with Mac OS X 10.7, Apple no longer offers Java as part of the Mac operating system. Since Webex Meetings previously relied on the Java browser plugin to download the meeting application for first-time users, users without Java installed found it difficult to join a meeting. The dependency on Java was removed. Instead, the user is asked to install a small plugin that, once installed, handles the rest of the meeting application installation and then starts the meeting.
When you start or join an event using Events (classic) for the first time on Safari 6.X and Safari 7, a problem occurs. After you have installed Webex, Safari requires you to trust the plugin for the site you’re attempting to join or start the event from. The page will refresh after that, but you’ll not join the event. In order to join, go back to the link you originally selected and you will be able to join successfully.
The following Webex services are available:
Webex Meetings
Webex Webinars

  Webcast mode for attendees doesn’t support Windows Server 2008 64-bit, Windows Server 2008 R2 64-bit, Mac OS 10.13, and Mac OS 10.14.

Webex Support is no longer supported on Mac OS as it relied on the Java client, which went EOL (End of Life) on April 1, 2021.

Ubuntu 14.x or later

Known issues and limitations for Linux on the Webex Meetings web app:
In some versions of Linux, users must proactively install and activate the “OpenH264 Video Codec provided by Cisco Systems, Inc.” plugin for the video, call my computer, and content sharing features to work in Firefox.
Content sharing doesn’t work in Linux versions that use Wayland as their display management system (such as Fedora 25 and later), due to an issue with the WebRTC screen sharing API.
Sending and receiving video doesn’t work in Fedora 28 due to an issue with the H.264 codec.
Linux clients are not supported for end-to-end encryption.
See the Web App Supported Operating Systems and Browsers for more information on the additional features for Linux that are available in the Webex Meetings desktop app.
Chrome OS support
Support for Google Chrome OS is currently available through the Webex Meetings Web App (Web-Based meeting client support) and the Webex Meetings Android App (Downloadable meeting client support).

Meetings virtual desktop software
Meetings provides an enhanced experience in Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) environments. When you attend meetings in a VDI environment, the Meetings software routes all audio and video streams directly between the thin client and the Meetings Cloud without going through the hosted desktop. The Meetings Desktop Virtual Software currently supports Citrix Virtual Desktop Environment and the support for VMware hosted environment is in early field trial.
