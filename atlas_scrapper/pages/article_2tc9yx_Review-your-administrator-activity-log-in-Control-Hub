Review your administrator activity log in Control Hub
Organization full and organization read-only administrators can review the activity log stored in Control Hub and audit administrator activities. The activity log includes events for all site configuration changes and recording management activities. Search for specific dates and narrow your results. Download the log to a comma-separated values (CSV) file, or use the admin audit event APIs to export it.

  Your site must be Control Hub managed or linked, to display all all site configuration changes and recording management activities.
Each report has a limit of 20,000 audit events that you can export. If your organization has more than 20,000 events, adjust the date or filters to reduce the number of events.

  We retain audit events for one year. If youâ€™re searching by date range, you can't search for events older than one year (from the current date).
1
Sign in to Control Hub at https://admin.webex.com and open the Troubleshooting page.
2
Click the Admin Activities tab.
You can filter by specific administrators, event descriptions, or impacted resources. You can also reduce the date range to help you find specific events.
3
Click Export to CSV to download the events to a file.
For more information about the events in the activity log, see Control Hub audit events reference.
