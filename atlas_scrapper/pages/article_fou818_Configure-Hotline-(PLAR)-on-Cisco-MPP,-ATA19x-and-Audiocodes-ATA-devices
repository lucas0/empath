Configure Hotline (PLAR) on Cisco MPP, ATA19x and Audiocodes ATA devices
As a customer administrator, you can configure a phone to automatically call a pre-defined number as soon as it goes off-hook, providing the benefit of speed and convenience. The Private Line Automatic Ringdown (PLAR) feature is a hotline configured in Cisco Webex Control Hub and applicable to ATA, Deskphone, users and workspaces.

Once PLAR is configured on a line, E911 dialing no longer works from that line. Phones set up with the PLAR feature can’t dial any other numbers from the line that is configured for PLAR.
