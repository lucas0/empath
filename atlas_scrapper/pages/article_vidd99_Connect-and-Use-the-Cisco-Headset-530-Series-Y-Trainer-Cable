Connect and Use the Cisco Headset 530 Series Y Trainer Cable
You can connect a second headset to the Cisco Headset 530 Series with the Y Trainer Cable. The Y Trainer Cable enables a trainer to listen in to a trainee's call and join if necessary. The switch on the trainer cable alternates voice control between the headsets so that a trainer or supervisor can quickly join a call if necessary. The color on each arm of the cable corresponds to the colors on the switch. When the switch shows blue, the blue-banded arm of the headset is active. When the switch shows light grey, the light grey arm of the cable is active.
